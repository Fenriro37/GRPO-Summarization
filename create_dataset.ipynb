         "small non - coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells . \n they include sirna ( small interfering rna ) , mirna ( microrna ) , pirna ( piwi - interacting rna ) and snorna ( small nucleolar rna ) . \n mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled - stranded small rna which are ~20  nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base - pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ] . although over 1,000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species , as many as 1,000 to 10,000 mirnas per genome have been predicted [ 3 , 4 ] . \n mirnas regulate a broad range of biological processes including timing of development , cell cycle progression , stem cell self - renewal , differentiation , cancer initiation , cancer cell proliferation , metastasis and apoptosis [ 511 ] . \n cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells . \n many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation . \n mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis . \n emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis , functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . \n although the current treatment of radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth , prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life , metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur . \n as small non - coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis , they may represent a novel cancer therapy . \n unlike mrna , mirnas are transcribed but never translated . some mirnas are transcribed from non - coding regions between genes , deriving from independent transcription unit . \n other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome , deriving from the introns of gene transcripts [ 13 , 14 ] . \n mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna . \n the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al . , \n in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines . \n zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array - based comparative genomic hybridization . \n the results demonstrated a high frequency ( ~72.8% ) of gene copy number abnormality in mirna - containing regions in human breast cancer . \n wang et al . collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues . \n mir-21 , mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over - expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir-126 , mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples . \n our studies of the mir-17 - 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient . \n subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling . \n although the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression . \n many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis . \n mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway . \n the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] . \n le et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 - 92 cluster . \n adams et al . reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer . \n the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary . \n herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation ( fig . \n 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in ~50% of breast cancer . \n the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate - limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition [ 23 , 24 ] . \n in addition , cyclin d1 is a critical downstream target of erbb2- , ras- and -catenin- induced breast cancers , and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice . \n antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut - transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice . \n conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 , mir-15/16 , mir-23 and let-7 . \n mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr , inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 , resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation [ 18 , 26 ] . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 - 92 , as well as mir-15/16 , was confirmed by deshpande et al . . \n the let-7 family functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers including lung , colon , ovarian   and breast cancer . \n schultz et al . demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis , and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( nrf-1 ) to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . \n furthermore , cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration , and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis . \n the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle , cell growth and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in breast cancer . \n mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1-s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ] . \n moreover , mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal - like breast cancers . \n the breast cancer basal - like subtype - specific mirnas , mir-221 and mir-222 , promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 ( trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ) which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression . \n mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance . \n the onco - mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . \n mir-21 induced cellular proliferation , migration , invasion , emt , cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer [ 42 , 43 ] . \n high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis , advanced stage , positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer . \n mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of a tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) . in colon cancer , \n mir-21 participates in a dna damage - induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a . \n a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells . with a potential anti - cancer chemical 3,3-diindolylmethane treatment , \n mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines . in mda - mb-231 cells , \n mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 , thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation . \n mir-27a suppressed myt-1 , increased cdc2/cyclin b activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda - mb-231 cells . thus , distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell - cycle checkpoints including cyclins , cdks , cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus . \n in addition to cell - cycle control , breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas . \n cancer stem cells ( cscs ) are characterized by their self - renewal capacity , an ability to differentiate into non - tumorigenic cell progeny , and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts . \n cell surface markers such as cd44 , cd24 , cd133 , epithelial - specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs . \n the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor - initiating cells ( t - ic ) has been widely investigated . \n let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells ( es cells ) and increases with differentiation . \n a comparison of mirna expression between breast t - ic and non - t - ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in t - ic and increased abundance with differentiation . \n transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells , inhibited cell proliferation , mammosphere formation , and tumor formation in vivo . \n clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs ( cd44cd24lineage ) and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells . \n the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem / progenitor cells . \n expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro , and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo . \n ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast t - ics self - renewal , inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 . \n zhu et al . found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast t - ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression , and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival . \n enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin - induced apoptosis and dna damage . \n emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation , cancer metastasis and drug resistance . \n cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer . \n the discovery that non - coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs , and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy . \n deletion of chromosome 6q , including region 6q14-q16 , is frequently observed in breast cancer . \n the small non - coding snorna u50 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 - 16 region , playing a role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer . \n genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines . \n re - expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 t and mda - mb-231 . \n pirnas are small non - coding rna that form rna - protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins . \n pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells , and considered as germ line - specific small rnas . \n emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells [ 57 , 58 ] and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells . \n high - throughput deep sequencing identified a group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines . \n the study of these non - coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting . \n the identification of the expression signature of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes , and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression , tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer . \n small non - coding rna - based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future . although tumor - targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer , mirna - based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models . \n synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro . chemically modified lna anti - sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells . \n kim et al . recently reported significant anti - tumor effect of virus - mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer . \n intranasal delivery of let-7   and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics   for non - small - cell lung cancer treatment and a virus - mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model   demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer . \n dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non - coding genome as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors of breast cancer . \n experimental evidence has shown specific mirnas regulating the initiation , progression , metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer via control of the cell cycle , altering cellular proliferation , altering cellular apoptosis and/or controlling the population of tumor stem cells . dysregulated \n mirna expression has also been observed in cancer associated fibroblasts ( caf ) and in the systemic circulation [ 65 , 66 ] . \n the circulating mirnas have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer . \n a specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients .",

         "the family is the cornerstone of human social support network and its presence is essential in everyone s life . changes inevitably occur in families with illness and hospitalization of a family member . in other words , among the sources of stress for families are accidents leading to hospitalization particularly intensive care unit ( icu ) . \n statistics show that 8% of hospital beds in the united states are occupied by the intensive care units . \n stress in the family while the patient is in the icu can disrupt the harmony power of the family members and finally , it may causes disturbances in the support of the patient . \n in addition to the various sources of stress in intensive care units such as the patient s fear of death , financial problems , lack of awareness about the environment and etc . , their satisfaction level is another important source of stress for the patient s family . \n today , the family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu are summarized in five sections . \n these factors may include receiving assurance , staying close to the patient , receiving information , feeling comfortable and receiving support . \n however , in many cases , the patient s family needs and their expectations in the icu will not be fulfilled which will cause dissatisfaction . since , how families deal with mental stress is the most important components of comprehensive care , it should be known that attention to the family needs of the patients hospitalized in intensive care units could increase their satisfaction and thus a reduction in stress disorders . \n studies showed that the nurses in particular sections focus primarily on the patient and the disease . \n therefore , attention to the families should be considered as an important part in patient management . \n effective interventions targeted at the needs and expectations of family members should help to reduce the stress and improve their satisfaction . \n fox et al . stated that the needs of the family members were not often overlooked by the nurses . \n however , the nurses spend a lot of time with the patients and their families and are in a good position to assess their needs and plan for meeting these needs with appropriate interventions . \n the reason of investigating the satisfaction of the families of the patients in the icu is that the patients are facing life - threatening illness experiences and complex treatments , different technologies and different equipment are used for them . \n these cases could potentially lead to the dissatisfaction of their families . in the meantime , \n the families of trauma and neurosurgical patients are more vulnerable than the other groups of patients . \n they need supports that are more emotional and should be accepted by the icu staff . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit , \n the aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients . \n the tool of society of critical care medicine s family needs assessment ( sccmfna ) ( which has been validated in 1998 by johnson ) was used in that study . \n the results showed that most of the family satisfaction was related to the communication and patient care and the lowest level of satisfaction was about the ability of staff to patients family comfort . \n bailey et al . have conducted a study in 2009 with the purpose of investigating the relationship between informational support to families of special care patients and their anxiety and satisfaction . \n they showed that there is a direct link between the informational support and their satisfaction . \n the study of fumis et al . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient s family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient s condition to them will increase the patient s family satisfaction . \n this clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction of the patients in the special care units and their families in iran . \n the purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital in 2010 . \n the statistical research community was the families of hospitalized patients in neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra ( sa ) hospital , isfahan , iran from may to september 2010 . \n with respect to inclusion criteria , the families of 64 patients were selected with simple sampling . after obtaining the informed consents from the hospitalized patients , by using the envelopes , which were prepaid by using a table of random numbers , they were divided into two groups ( intervention and control ) . \n the inclusion criteria was included as the following cases : to be a first - degree member of the family , to be older than 18 years , willing to participate in the study , having the power to speak and write in farsi , to be hospitalized one day before the study , lack of physical or mental problem in the family member , no responsibility for the care of another patient , introduced as the first person responsible for the patient care . \n obtaining the written informed consent , completion of the questionnaires about demographic information and the families satisfaction were performed in the second day of hospitalization of the patients in icu in both groups . \n johnson questionnaire for the satisfaction of the family of icu patients was used to measure the family satisfaction . \n the rating of the questionnaire was performed by using the likert scale with four options of 0 to 4 as follows : almost all the time ( 3 scores ) , often ( 2 scores ) , only occasionally ( 1 score ) and never ( zero score ) . \n johnson s questionnaire was the modified type of multer patient s family needs , which was evaluated in various scientific researches and there are extensive evidences for its validity . \n the interventions were performed in the second and the third day of hospitalization of the patient in the neurosurgery icu by the researcher in the morning shift for the intervention group . \n thus , the researcher provided understandable explanations about the disease to the patient s family and answered honestly to the questions about the patient and the disease . \n the researcher ensured them for providing the best care in the section and spoke about the prognosis of the disease . \n the researcher took the family member to the patient s room and gave the necessary information about the room space , equipment , personnel departments and the actions that were done for the patient . \n the patient family member was contacted if there was a change in the patient condition . \n they let the family help the patient in some cases of the public health ( such as hand and foot massage and giving food ) . \n locations of rest , nutrition , prayer room , bathroom and buffet of the hospital were introduced to them . \n the telephone numbers of hospitals and wards ( and if necessary , the social worker and supervisor ) were given . \n various departments and personnel of the hospital were taught to accept the families and communicate with them . the hospital social worker was introduced and if necessary , the patient s family was allowed to express their feelings . \n these interventions were performed in the evening shift of the second and the third day of the patient reception . \n the actions were carried out by the fellow researcher . while , for the control group , only the routine work was done . on the fourth day , the satisfaction survey was completed by the selected family member in both of the intervention and control groups . \n statistical methods used in this study were 2 test , man - whitney , independent student s t - test and paired t - tests . \n the findings did not show statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups , such as : age ( p < 0.99 ) , gender ( p < 0.79 ) , marital status ( p < 0.41 ) , educational level ( p < 0.12 ) and relation with patient ( p < 0.54 ) . as shown in table 1 \n , there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score before the intervention in the intervention and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) . \n the mean satisfaction score after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly more than the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . \n the mean satisfaction score in the intervention group after the intervention was significantly higher than before the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . \n there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score in the control group before and after the intervention ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . \n comparison of mean satisfaction score ( 100 * ) of participants in the intervention and control groups the mean of satisfaction score changes of the studied subjects in the intervention and control groups after intervention \n the results of the present study showed that the nursing interventions based on the family needs increased the patient s family satisfaction in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital . \n due to the differences in the study design , study population , the number of samples and methods of intervention , it would be difficult to compare the results . in chien et al . \n study , the results showed that performing the training based on the patients family needs in the icu , decreased the anxiety and increased their satisfaction . in the study of myhren et al . indicated that effective communication of the staff with the families of icu patients would increase their satisfaction . \n in the study by rosher and robinson , it showed that involving the families in patient care led to increase their satisfaction than before the intervention . \n the mentioned results were consistent with the results of this study , because all of these interventions were some parts of the interventions performed in this study . \n however , the study of steele et al . indicated that clinical training had no impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in the icu \n . therefore , there was no statistically significant difference in the satisfaction level in the control and intervention group . \n in this study , it was shown that the use of nursing interventions based on family needs ( confidence , support , information , proximity and convenience ) had significant impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in intensive care unit . \n they should be based on the family investigation and recognition and their priority needs should be determined in order to cause the greatest satisfaction . \n the icu nurses must also accept their role in the care of patient s family members . \n the findings of this study could be a basis for performing further studies about family needs of the patients in the icu especially with the different forms of culture and economy . \n consequently , the increase in family satisfaction of patients can reduce the stress disorders and improve their mental state and ultimately better support of the patient by the family . \n this study only examined the effect of nursing interventions in the first days of hospitalization on the satisfaction of the families but the effects on the patient s entire hospitalization period has not been assessed . by performing other researches in this field \n , it would be possible to compare the differences in the effects of nursing interventions based on the needs of families in the early days and the whole period of the patient s hospitalization .",
         "background : since the family is a social system , the impairment in each of its component members may disrupt the entire family system . \n one of the stress sources for families is accidents leading to hospitalization particularly in the intensive care unit ( icu ) . in many cases , \n the families needs in patient care are not met that cause dissatisfaction . since the nurses spend a lot of time with patients and their families , they are in a good position to assess their needs and perform appropriate interventions . \n therefore , this study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery icu.materials and methods : this clinical trial was conducted in the neurosurgery icu of al - zahra hospital , isfahan , iran in 2010 . \n sixty four families were selected by simple sampling method and were randomly placed in two groups ( test and control ) using envelopes . in the test group , \n some interventions were performed to meet their needs . in the control group , \n the routine actions were only carried out . \n the satisfaction questionnaire was completed by both groups two days after admission and again on the fourth day.findings:both of the intervention and control groups were compared in terms of the mean satisfaction scores before and after intervention . \n there was no significant difference in mean satisfaction scores between test and control groups before the intervention . \n the mean satisfaction score significantly increased after the intervention compared to the control group.conclusions:nursing interventions based on family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu increase their satisfaction . \n attention to family nursing should be planned especially in the icus .",

binding sites , i.e. , the s189n change within antibody - binding site b ( 4,5 ) and the v226i and s227p changes residing in antibody - binding site d ( 4,5 ) . because of rotational restrictions , a proline substitution at position 227 ( s227p ) would typically give rise to considerable conformation change ; however , this particular substitution is located within a  barrel motif and therefore has little effect on regional protein conformation . cumulatively , field isolates characterized subsequent to this outbreak continue to exhibit these 4 changes , and they appear to constitute a distinct branch in the phylogeny of ha sequences when compared with h3n2 isolates from the 20032004 season . \n . this change may affect protein - protein interactions since it is immediately adjacent to antibody - binding site a , where neutralizing antibodies have been shown to bind ( 4,5 ) . \n furthermore , since the k145n substitution is located within a glycosylation site , the charge alteration may affect glycosyl transferase activity , which results in altered glycosylation . \n differences in glycosylation have been shown to contribute to antigenic variation by preventing antibody binding to antigenic sites ( 15 ) . \n additionally , 3-dimensional analysis suggests this amino acid substitution may also promote enhanced receptor binding since the asparagine r group is shorter , which may make binding requirements less stringent and the receptor cleft more accessible . \n the 3-dimensional depiction provides a unique regional residue perspective , demonstrating how the rapidly evolving ha surface antigens in the vaccine strain differ at the molecular level . \n collectively , the clinical isolates obtained from this outbreak in nepal can not be considered antigenically distinct from the a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain because only 4 of 9 isolates evaluated exhibited 4-fold lower titers by hi ( table 1 ) . \n furthermore , the varying reactivity noted in several isolates from this outbreak having identical ha1 sequences is suggestive that other viral antigens aside from the ha1 protein may have contributed to the antigenic variability observed in the hi panel . with the exception of a / nepal/1670/2004 and a / nepal/1672/2004 , all isolates evaluated by hi ( table 1 ) exhibited identical ha1 amino acid sequences and varying antigenicity profiles to a / wyoming/03/2003 reference antisera . \n one explanation for this observation is that genetic differences in other influenza surface proteins contribute to the observed immunoreactivity . \n alternative viral surface protein candidates include the neuraminidase , ha2 , and m2 glycoproteins , which have been shown to exhibit antigenic properties ( 1619 ) . in this report \n , we describe the genetic analysis of the ha proteins from viruses obtained from an early season outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains . \n three amino acids changes ( s189n , i226v , and s227p ) were noted in known ( 4,5 ) antibody - binding sites ( table 2 ) . the fourth change ( k145n ) , which was located within a glycosylation site , may enhance viral binding since the smaller asparagine r group is located close to the ha receptor - binding cleft ( figure 3 ) . \n phylogenetic analyses show that the nepal isolates make up a distinct branch in the evolution of h3n2 viruses when they are compared with vaccine and reference strains ( figure 2 ) . however , antigenic data appear more ambiguous , suggesting a multigenic effect that can not solely be attributed to properties of the influenza ha ( table 1 ) . \n studies are in progress to characterize the neuraminidase , m2 , and ha2 proteins to determine the molecular basis responsible for antigenicity differences observed within isolates from this outbreak . \n the k145n substitution change has become a marker for an increasingly large subset of the fujian - like viruses . \n cdc and the us department of defense have recently characterized viruses with the k145n change in singapore , taiwan , china , australia , canada , and the united states . in february 2005 , who reported the emergence of a new influenza h3n2 strain in the united states . \n the a / california/7/2004 strain , which was first identified in the united states in september 2004 , contains all 4 changes observed in isolates from this nepalese outbreak . \n the a / california/7/2004 strain differs by only 1 amino acid in ha1 ( which is of no immunologic importance ) from most isolates from the outbreak in nepal . \n all viruses characterized ( 150 globally isolated strains ) subsequent to the preparation of this report ( march 2005 ) by the us department of defense are genetically similar in amino acid sequence to these nepalese strains ( and the a / california strain ) . \n most of the isolates ( 80% ) analyzed by cdc since october 2004 are antigenically related to a / california ( 20 ) , which indicates that this strain has emerged as the dominant influenza a h3n2 strain . \n these data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant strain at the onset of the 20052006 influenza season . in february 2005 , who recommended inclusion of an a / california/7/2004-like strain in the 20052006 trivalent influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from this variant h3n2 virus . \n our findings emphasize the importance of continued molecular surveillance for characterizing emerging influenza drift variants .",

         "medical tourism is illustrated as occurrence in which individuals travel abroad to receive healthcare services ( 1 ) . \n it is a multi - billion dollar industry and countries like india , thailand , singapore , malaysia , belgium , costa rica , cuba , dubai , hungary , israel , jordan , south africa and many others are being benefited in their economy by this recent phenomenon ( 2 , 3 ) . \n the prime driving factors in medical tourism are increased medical costs , increased insurance premiums , increasing number of uninsured or partially insured individuals in developed countries , long waiting lists for procedures in countries having public healthcare system , availability of high quality services at affordable price , and cheaper airfare . increased communication and internet access in developing countries \n are other supporting factors , which help patients to develop awareness about international travel for medical care ( 47 ) . \n estimations can vary but still some of reliable sources claim ; gross medical tourism revenue worldwide was more than us$ 40 billion in year 2004 and reached up to us$ 100 billion by year 2012 ( 8) . in year 2007 \n , it was estimated that around 750,000 us residents traveled abroad . accordingly , the base case estimated form 2007 to 2010 for the annual growth rate for outbound patients was 100 per cent in us ( 9 ) . \n forbes business estimated around 1.25 million americans were expected to travel outside for medical treatment in year 2014 ( 10 ) . \n after thorough review it was found that there is huge gap in literature available in medical tourism . \n accounts detailing size and market of the industry are large in number yet there is scarcity of literature detailing about role and significance of different variables and linking them to form conceptual and theoretical framework which reflects decision making of international patients for taking part in medical tourism . \n available literature explore various factors related to patients travel such as source of information , perceived risks , benefits of medical tourism and attributes of medical tourism destinations in sufficient amount but almost all of these related accounts are exploratory in nature and do not provide conceptual frameworks for testing . \n many researchers ( 2 , 6 , 11 , 12 ) made calls to explore more about the decision making process based on conceptual models and test them empirically , so managers in medical tourism industry will be more acquainted about the needs and requirements of patients and design their future strategies accordingly and at the same time patients will also be benefited by receiving more quality services from the providers . \n this article will draw a conceptual model based on patients source of information , perceived benefits , perceived risks , and medical tourism destination image with available literature that will be helpful to mangers to draw their future course of action for competitive advantage and at the same time fulfill the gap in available literature . \n image formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place . \n various studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain destinations as possible alternatives ( 1317 ) . \n consumer behavior studies have already established the effects of source of information on purchase behavior ( 18 ) . \n amount and type of different information sources directly influence in development of cognitive image formation of destination ( 19 ) . \n source of information is a vital antecedent of destination image formation and destination choice intention ( 20 ) . \n there are four ( i ) professional advice ( tour operators , travel agents , airlines ) ( ii ) word of mouth ( friends , relatives , social media ) ( iii ) advertisement , and ( iv ) news / books / movies , different categories of type of information sources usually consider responsible for destination image formation ( 13 ) , this article use these four categories of source of information for medical tourism destinations image formation . \n medical tourism facilitators are specialized in promotion of medical services abroad and offer supportive services such as assisting in selection of country and hospital , correspondence with doctors , travel arrangements , and arrangements of required paper work ( 21 , 22 ) . \n judgment of agent related to travel of their clients has high influence on decisions of clients ( 23 ) . \n these facilitators serve as motivators also due to providing much - needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own . \n many hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) . \n literature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra - structure , unavailability of specialized manpower , and unavailability of medication ( 2730 ) . \n word of mouth and recommendation also has high influence in decision making of international patients in selection of destinations , hospitals , and doctors . \n studies revealed large numbers of patients visit different countries for medical services were received recommendations from family members , friends , relatives , and colleagues ( 3134 ) . \n websites and online forums created by experienced international patients to share their experiences with medical tourism are also considered as decisive source of information for those planning to take medical services abroad ( 35 , 36 ) . \n printed materials are also used to promote the services by hospitals and clinics , for example air mauritius in - flight magazine provides details about procedures and services provided by the hair grafting clinics in mauritius ( 2 ) . \n major medium of promotion of services by destination countries are trade fairs , travel markets / travel fairs , exhibitions , seminars and conferences to make potential patients informed about products and services offered by destinations . \n some of these fairs and exhibitions are organized in collaboration with government agencies like tat , ministry of foreign affairs and department of export promotion but some providers organized these events by their own in cooperation with local institutes , medical schools and universities ( 37 ) . \n print media play an important role in promotion and advertising medical tourism in major source countries , publish attractive and evidence based stories in their different segments related to health and travel . \n los angeles time first examined about the growth of medical tourism and marked it as trend . later on new york times and los angeles times published stories of satisfied patients . \n fox , cbs s  60 minutes  and cnn aired their segments on patients traveling to medical services . \n magazines like forbes and wall street journal analyzed the business aspect of medical tourism as  brokers assertively marketed medical tourism to consumers , employers , and insurers ( 38 ) . \n literature revealed that not every physical attribute of a destination has influence on image formation process . \n there is substantial inequality between descriptive dimensions of image and the attributes which are considered important for decision making within individuals ( 39 ) . \n it is generally presumed in marketing that products with similar characteristics will be equally preferred by the consumers , however , attributes , which make the product similar to other products , will not be necessarily same at the time of actual purchase . the importance of attributes will be change according to the need of consumer ( 40 ) . wish ( 1971 ) cited in ( 40 ) found that despite have many similarities individual like one country and dislike another one . \n this is due to dimensions of liking may not be agree with the dimensions of similarity . \n literature revealed that many researchers made distinction between physical and beneficial aspect of a product . \n few researchers explained it as  characteristic and  benefits to the physical and beneficial aspect of product respectively ( 41 ) . \n the typology of different attributes of product has been proven fruitful because by this a product s features can be segments into three groups as characteristic , beneficial , and imagery . \n there are three components of vacation destination image formation ; ( i ) based on awareness : rely on the information sources , tourist believes about what a destination possesses , ( ii ) based on attitude : feelings and beliefs about destination , and ( iii ) based on expectations : expected benefits obtain from a tourist product ( 43 ) . \n the above mention discussion clearly indicates that process of image formation is not just emphasis on physical attributes of destination but also depends on benefits or consumption values of product or service consumers hold in their minds . \n benefits offered by a product or service are considered as consumption value of the same ( 44 ) . \n sheth , newman and gross ( 1991 ) developed a theory known as theory of consumption values , which focuses on consumption values of products and services ( 45 ) . \n conditional value. the decision making of consumer choice behaviour can be based on all five or any of the five consumption values . \n consumption value model define the characteristics of  functional value as price , credibility , and durability . \n medical tourism destinations offer very low price for medical services to international patients in comparison to developed countries , and most of the time price of a procedure in india and other asian destination is equal to 1/10 of price in us or european countries ( 4 , 4648 ) . \n quality of medical services is one of the aspects which drive medical tourism high towards success . \n most of the hospitals in india provide medical care services to international patients are certified by jci which has reputation for hospital safety and regulatory management and recognized worldwide ( 49 ) . \n high procedure success rate also forms image as quality medical tourism destination of various destinations at south asian , african and latin america ( 48 , 49 ) . \n although availability of literature explain  social value in medical tourism is less , little available literature clearly define the \n social value aspect has been clearly observed in yemeni patients travel abroad for treatment ( 27 , 50 ) . \n senior male members of the household consider it as opportunity to increase their reputation in society . availing expensive and prestigious medical care service in foreign countries and the associated sacrifices with it would make stories full of pride to tell to others ( 51 ) . \n most of the citizens of yemen do not obtain resources to go for leisure travel at different parts of the world therefore traveling to foreign country for medical services provide chance to explore new territory , meet new people , and experience different social culture ( 27 , 50 ) . \n however , the concept of social value and epistemic value may not be associated with patients from developed regions . \n many researchers found in their studies that patients were highly motivated to travel to a particular destination due to emotional attachment with doctor , hospitals or destination ( 6 , 50 ) . \n such as , many omani patients visit shiraz in iran for treatment due to religious and cultural familiarity ( 52 ) . \n conditional value can be considered as major factor pushes patients to travel abroad because medical needs are crucial and considered as unavoidable so have great conditional value . \n perceived risks is defined as perception of an individual about the probability that a particular action will lead them to a situation exposed with danger more than acceptable limit , and will lead to influence travel decision - making ( 53 ) . security and safety at the destination is major issue of concern by the potential travelers . in travel decision , \n making perception of risks has utmost importance due to its tendency to alter destination selection ( 54 ) . \n researchers argued in favor of conducting study on perceived risks and destination image together ( 55 ) . in tourism literature , authors considered safety and security at destination as one of the pull factors caused destination image formation ( 13 , 14 , 56 ) . \n however , in general cognitive image of destination does not engage with varied range of travel specific risks at destination and consider safety and risks as one of the many other attributes associated with destination ( 54 ) . \n in addition , at the same time perceived risks are considered as potential inhibitors of travel ( 57 ) . \n researchers argued that using cognitive image to understand the dimensions of travel risks will be a conceptual mistake ( 58 ) . \n hence , perceived risks and cognitive image should consider individual variables for image related studies in travel . \n credence goods as the quality of these good can not be assessed accurately even after consumption . \n patients may vulnerable to many risks if consider to take medical services at medical tourism destinations . \n researchers described six dimension of risks associated with health travelers visited israel as  human - induced risks , \n financial risks ,  service quality risks ,  socio - psychological risk ,  natural disasters and car accident risk , and \n after thorough literature review , authors categorized medical tourism destination perceived risks into three categories , as  physical - health related risks ,  service related risks , and  destination related risks. physical risks are considered as possibility of physical danger or injury detrimental to health where as health risks are considered as possibility to becoming sick while traveling or at destination ( 54 ) . \n in medical tourism , international patients can be exposed with different diseases , so risk of contracting with a different kind of disease is even higher such as blood borne infection and infection due to improper screening and storage of blood , deep - vein thrombosis ( dvt ) to those patients returning home after surgery , language related risks and lose of money can also be a matter of concern while involved in medical tourism . \n health risks for patients travel for organ transplant is even higher due to ignorance of standard protocol in donor selection ( 12 , 6062 ) . \n literature revealed few american patients came in contact with non - tuberculous mycobecterial infection while taking treatment in hospitals abroad ( 63 , 64 ) . \n researchers consider terrorism and kidnapping of rich patients and unstable economy of the destination as other risks associated with medical related travel . \n apart from physical - health and service related risks , every destination have its own associated risks ; risks of terrorism , crime , and personal safety are associated with medical tourism destination due to falling in middle and lower middle - income countries in development status ( 63 ) . according to researchers , destination image is the total of ideas , beliefs , and impressions individuals possess about the attributes of destination and or activities available at a destination after processing information from various sources over a period of time ( 39 , 65 ) . \n destination image as overall imagery picture individual obtains in his mind ( 66 ) . in the early studies on travel \n , researchers used the concept of stereotypic image of a travel destination ( 67 , 68 ) . later on , to understand the destination image formation process researchers developed an alternative framework and argued destination image consist of two components i.e. attribute based and holistic ( 66 ) . \n attribute based component refers to the perception of individual based on destination features and holistic component refers to imaginary mental image of destination . \n later on , a bi - dimensional model was presented by researchers to represent destination image , consist of cognitive and affective image component ( 13 , 69 ) . \n the cognitive component of destination image develops on knowledge and beliefs of destination based on tangible attributes , whereas affective component of image develops on emotions and feelings about the destination ( 70 , 71 ) . \n researchers further studied affective image of destination and illustrate a four semantic differential scale to evaluate the affective component of destination image based on arousing \n furthermore , cognitive component of destination image is an antecedent of affective component ( 72 ) . \n thus , a distinctive image of a destination forms in tourists mind based on strength and weakness of attributes of cognitive and affective components . image of destination formed in consumer s mind is defined as aggregate of attributes and beliefs ( 73 ) . \n it means if tourist has enough level of positive beliefs about attributes of destination it is expected that s / he has developed favorable attitude towards destination . \n the process of destination image formation is described as mental construct of representation of destination based on information cues transmitted by image inducing agents chosen by individual ( 19 ) . \n after thorough literature review authors identified four dimension of cognitive medical tourism destination image based of different attributes projected by different medical tourism destinations , as ;  medical amenities ,  general infra - structure ,  tourism attractions , and \n social environment. most of the hospitals websites are dominated with images stressing on sophistication , advanced technology , cleanliness and efficiency . \n majority of these sites are in english highlight the variety of procedures , price , accreditation of hospitals , and affiliation of doctors , qualified and smart staff , lavishly furnished accommodations , and testimonials of past patients , and efficiency with different languages of staff . \n command on technology is rarely missed in any form of marketing ( 12 , 46 , 74 , 75 ) . \n based on mentioned qualities , medical tourism destinations project themselves as most suited destination for potential travelers ( 28 , 32 , 76 ) . to nullify the quality related concerns of international patients hospitals and medical tourism facilitators / brokers emphasis on the markers of quality services . \n physicians trainings in world reputed institutes like national institute for health , johns hopkins university , university of birmingham , and other reputed universities are highlighted in the profiles of physicians . \n prominent display of training and expertise of doctors achieve two goals ; established trustworthiness and mitigate concerns related to risk . \n the accreditation awarded by jci is promoted by hospitals as mark of offering medical care of american standards ( 2 , 28 , 77 ) . \n collaboration with prestigious hospitals in us and europe in also indicate seriousness towards providing quality services to patients by medical tourism hospitals at different destination ( 21 , 78 ) . distinguishing that major market drivers such as lack of health insurance and unaffordability are influencing patients to take procedures abroad , websites of brokerages predominantly display the comparative cost charts and price schedules . \n most of the destinations claim providing significant cost services through different sources of promotion ( 5 , 79 , 80 ) . \n most the promotions and advertisements show smiling , well - dressed and empathetic medical staff taking care of international patients . \n many hospitals focus on multi - lingual staff providing services to patients speaking different major languages of the world . \n language is also an influencing factor in decision making in selection of destination ( 11 , 37 ) . \n facilities and quality of accommodation to international patients and their companions play important role in attracting the foreign patients . \n essential supportive services like local transportation services , food , communication , and others are also important in attracting the patients to a destination . \n thailand for example attracts more patients from developed countries because of already established quality tourism infrastructure offer excellent accommodation and hospitality services to international patients ( 81 ) . despite offering excellent medical care to international patients by hospitals in india most of the international patients visit india worry about accommodation quality , food hygiene , and personal safety ( 82 , 83 ) . \n potential tourists prefer to receive medical services to the places where they are also interested for holidaying ( 75 , 84 ) . after focusing on cost and reliability \n image formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place . \n various studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain

physicians trainings in world reputed institutes like national institute for health , johns hopkins university , university of birmingham , and other reputed universities are highlighted in the profiles of physicians . \n prominent display of training and expertise of doctors achieve two goals ; established trustworthiness and mitigate concerns related to risk . \n the accreditation awarded by jci is promoted by hospitals as mark of offering medical care of american standards ( 2 , 28 , 77 ) . \n collaboration with prestigious hospitals in us and europe in also indicate seriousness towards providing quality services to patients by medical tourism hospitals at different destination ( 21 , 78 ) . distinguishing that major market drivers such as lack of health insurance and unaffordability are influencing patients to take procedures abroad , websites of brokerages predominantly display the comparative cost charts and price schedules . \n most of the destinations claim providing significant cost services through different sources of promotion ( 5 , 79 , 80 ) . \n most the promotions and advertisements show smiling , well - dressed and empathetic medical staff taking care of international patients . \n many hospitals focus on multi - lingual staff providing services to patients speaking different major languages of the world . \n language is also an influencing factor in decision making in selection of destination ( 11 , 37 ) . \n facilities and quality of accommodation to international patients and their companions play important role in attracting the foreign patients . \n essential supportive services like local transportation services , food , communication , and others are also important in attracting the patients to a destination . \n thailand for example attracts more patients from developed countries because of already established quality tourism infrastructure offer excellent accommodation and hospitality services to international patients ( 81 ) . despite offering excellent medical care to international patients by hospitals in india most of the international patients visit india worry about accommodation quality , food hygiene , and personal safety ( 82 , 83 ) . \n potential tourists prefer to receive medical services to the places where they are also interested for holidaying ( 75 , 84 ) . after focusing on cost and reliability \n prominent databases ( 2013 , 2014 , 2015 ) have been searched to obtain desire literature related to medical tourism including science direct , utmj.org , nih.gov , nchu.edu.tw , palgrave - journals , medretreat , biomedcentral and so on and the keywords used are medical tourism , information sources , medical travel , health travel and so on . \n google search was performed to get latest data related to medical tourism . to know in detail about the variables used in the framework scientific research databases \n the key words used to find out research variables as well as relationship between researches variables were destination image , destination information sources , beneficial image , perceived travel risks , cognitive image , affective image , consumption values and so on . to obtain data about medical tourism various types of available literature were reviewed such as industry reports , market research reports , media reports and internet sources , however for identification and explanation of variables scientific literature published in reputed journals only were included . \n the theory of planned ( tpb ) is an established and comprehensively tested model details the relationship between beliefs , attitude , intention , and actual behavior of consumers ( 85 ) . the model is perfectly applied in a variety of studies including leisure and tourism travel , and hospitality ( 36 , 8688 ) . \n these research studies emphases on the factors such as motivations , information sources , attitudes , and visit intentions , thus authors argue that attitudinal theory provides a sound foundation to understand travel intentions of international patients and underpin the conceptual model discussed in this article . \n studies explained that consumers access more information in case of high association of risks or benefits or both in a particular act ( 89 , 90 ) and perform rigorous information search in case of planning first time trip ( 91 ) because first time trip is associated with unknown risks as well as unknown leisure activities . \n in general consumer behaviour practices risk - handling activity increases in case of high level of perceived risks . \n importance of risk handling activity also determines by associated benefits gained after engaging with risk taking activity ( 92 ) . \n the benefits of information search includes possibility of finding superior alternative to those already considered and the reduction in risk achieved from eliminating inferior , but a priori uncertain , alternatives ( 93 ) . with the discussion of above literature related to tourism \n it could be assumed that medical tourism information sources will have positive influence on perceived travel benefits of international patients . whereas , information sources of medical tourism will negatively influence perceived travel risks of international patients . \n destination image is considered as perceptions or impressions of destination held by tourists with respect to the expected benefit or consumption values . \n the benefits sought by the travelers are highly associated with the image of destination and the affective image of destination is largely highly influenced by the motivations / benefits sought by individuals ( 13 , 44 ) . \n the affective image of a destination is more positive in individual s mind when emotions evoked by the place coincide with the benefits sought ( 95 ) . \n risks and constraints associated with travel have significant impact on destination image formation at the time of early decision - making process ( 96 ) . according to researchers , \n two dimensions significantly influence cognitive and affective image of destination ( 58 ) . on the basis of previous studies in tourism literature \n it can be assumed that perceived travel benefits of international patients will positively influence the destination image , whereas perceived travel risks of international patients will negatively influence the destination image . \n intention of visit related to travel is considered as tourists perceived likelihood to visit particular destination within a specific time period ( 97 ) . \n thus , to be closely correlated to the travel behaviour intention of visit believes as an important outcome variable in tourism research ( 16 , 97 ) . \n intention to visit a destination is highly influenced by cognitive / perceptual and affective evaluation ( 98 ) . \n destination image is a direct antecedent of perceived quality , satisfaction and revisit intention and recommendation ( 99 ) . according to researchers \n , there is significant theoretical and empirical link between cognitive destination image and behavioral intention ( 100 ) . \n based on above discussion it could be assumed that image of medical tourism destination will positively influence visit intention of international patients . conceptual framework  international patients travel decision making \n the article is a sincere effort by authors to establish conceptual framework which explains decision - making process of international patients . \n though , there has been advance in explaining different factors play important roles in international patients travel , however , there is scarcity of literature conceptualizing these factors into a framework and test it empirically . \n literature reveals about associated benefits and risks related to travel abroad for medical purposes but do not conceptualize it in the process of decision - making . \n sources of information in medical tourism play significant role in development of attitude as well as intention , has already been established in consumer behavior . \n however , need is to test its significance in medical tourism decision - making process . \n the proposed framework will encourage future researchers to test different variables empirically and establish the model of international patients travel behavior . \n ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc . ) have been completely observed by the authors .",

         "squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( hnscc ) is a heterogeneous disease that includes tumors arising from the mucosal epithelial surface of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , and larynx . although these tumors originate within different anatomic sites within the upper aerodigestive tract , they are histologically identical ( 95% of hnscc are squamous cell carcinomas ) , share common etiologic risk factors and overlapping metastatic target site profiles ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) . \n recent genetic analysis of human head and neck tumors has revealed common molecular alterations including p53 mutation , p14arf , and p16 methylation , as well as cyclin d and egfr amplification [ 36 ] . despite these similarities , \n the distinct anatomic subsites are associated with differing rates of regional metastasis  for example , vocal cord lesions tend to metastasize less frequently than oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal lesions . this variation may be attributed to differing densities of lymph draining vessels within each of the relevant subsites . \n patients who exhibit metastases into the regional nodal basin exhibit a 50% decrease in survival irrespective of treatment [ 715 ] . \n currently , it is the 5th leading cause of cancer by incidence and the 6th leading cause of cancer mortality in the world [ 16 , 17 ] . \n recurrent and/or metastatic hnscc patients have a poor prognosis , with a median survival of less than 1 - 2 years [ 18 , 19 ] . \n several lines of evidence indicate that cancer is a disease resulting from dynamic changes in the genome that promote the progressive transformation of normal human cells into highly malignant derivatives [ 20 , 21 ] . during this process , \n cancer cells acquire several unique capabilities including self - sufficiency in response to growth signals , insensitivity to antigrowth signals , evasion of programmed death ( apoptosis ) , limitless replicative potential , sustained angiogenesis as well as invasion and metastasis , reprogramming of energy metabolism , and avoiding immune destruction [ 21 , 22 ] . \n detailed global genomic analyses of several human tumors has revealed that certain classes of signaling proteins appear to be targeted more frequently by oncogenic mutations . \n receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) are a good example . of the 59 transmembrane rtks identified to date , \n dysregulation of ~30 rtks are associated with neoplastic transformation and cancer progression [ 2325 ] . \n interestingly , ninety percent of primary head and neck squamous cell cancers , irrespective of subsite , have alterations in members of the epidermal growth factor ( egf ) family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( erbbs ) , in particular erbb1/egfr . \n ten to fifteen percent of tumors will also have an alteration in another egfr family member , the erbb2/her2/neu receptor [ 27 , 28 ] . \n these findings suggest a strong etiologic role for rtk dysregulation in this type of tumors . given this association , patients with head and neck squamous cell cancers are well positioned to benefit from existing and future molecular targeted agents directed against oncogenic rtks such as egfr ( reviewed in ) . \n rtks are a family of transmembrane proteins that mediate many important physiological processes in both normal and cancerous cells . \n ligand binding to the extracellular domain of rtks induces receptor dimerization and activation of rtk activity . \n subsequent autophosphorylation of the receptor at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain generates binding sites for proteins that relay downstream biological signals to regulate protein function , protein - protein interactions , and gene expression . under physiological conditions , \n rtk dysregulation can occur through several mechanisms including gene amplification or rtk overexpression , chromosomal translocation to produce constitutively active rtks , gain of function mutations or deletions that promote ligand - independent rtk activity , escape from negative regulatory mechanisms or local environmental changes , all of which lead to potent oncogenic signaling and hence neoplastic growth . \n these complex signaling networks use multiple factors to drive the outcome of rtk signaling . although often depicted as linear pathways , they actually represent an integrated network with various modes of cross - talk , overlapping and distinct functions . \n known signaling pathways involved in head and neck tumorigenesis include the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( pi3k)-akt - mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stats ) and raf kinase - mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( mek)-p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling pathways [ 1 , 30 ] . \n this review highlights three rtk signaling pathways involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ; egfr , the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) and the hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) receptor ( met ) . \n this short review will explore the relative contribution of each signaling axis to disease progression , potential modes of cross - talk , and targeted clinical approaches under investigation for disease management . \n the egfr family of rtks is comprised of four different receptors known as erbb1 ( also referred to as egfr ) , erbb2 ( her2/neu in rodents ) , erbb3 ( her3 ) , and erbb4 ( her4 ) ( reviewed in [ 3133 ] ) . each receptor , with the exception of erbb3 , contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated by binding to extracellular egf - like ligands , which result in receptor dimerization and hence activation of downstream signaling cascades including mapk , pi3k / akt and stat signaling . \n eleven egf - like ligands have been identified to date that can be categorized into four groups  those that bind egfr only ( egf , transforming growth factor alpha ( tgf ) , and amphiregulin ) , those that bind to egfr and her4 ( heparin binding - egf , betacellulin and epiregulin ) , those binding directly to either her3 and her4 ( neuregulin 1 and neuregulin 2 ) and her4 binding only ( neuregulin 3 and neuregulin 4 ) ( reviewed in ) . \n epigen , the most recently discovered member of the egf - like ligand family appears to be a low affinity and broad specificity ligand that effectively activates egfr . \n erbb2 is considered a ligand - less coreceptor as it does not have any known ligands that bind directly with high affinity , despite its established role as a potent oncogene in several cancer types including breast , colorectal , nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc ) and hnscc [ 36 , 37 ] . \n aberrant egfr activity has been strongly linked to the etiology of 5890% of hnscc [ 26 , 38 ] . \n these rates can vary due to the inclusion of cancers from different subsites within the head and neck , methods used to assess gene amplification and tumor scoring methods . in contrast to lung adenocarcinomas in which activating egfr mutations result in ligand - independent signaling [ 3943 ] , such activating egfr mutations are infrequent in hnscc [ 44 , 45 ] . \n egfr gene amplification resulting in upwards of 12 copies per cell has been reported in hnscc patients compared to copy numbers detected in normal mucosa from noncancer patients . \n this and other pathways of ligand - independent receptor activation that do not require egfr overexpression have been characterized as the likely drivers of egfr activity in hnscc . \n egfr gene amplification remains a strong indicator for poor patient survival , radioresistance , and locoregional failure [ 4749 ] . \n egfr overexpression is detected in healthy mucosa in cancer patients ( field cancerization ) that will increase in proportion to observed histological abnormalities such as hyperplasia , carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma , indicating that it is an early event in hnscc . \n accordingly , significant effort has focused on egfr signaling as a therapeutic target for treating hnscc patients . \n cetuximab , matuzumab and nimotuzumab represent humanized antiegfr antibodies , whereas gefitinib and erlotinib are small tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) ( figure 1 ) . \n cetuximab ( erbitux ) competitively inhibits endogenous ligand - binding to egfr and thereby inhibits subsequent receptor activation [ 5053 ] . \n cetuximab is a valuable treatment option in head and neck patients as it synergizes with current treatment modalities . \n cetuximab enhances the effects of many standard cytotoxic agents , including cisplatin ( the conventional platinum - fluorouracil chemotherapeutic ) , and in combination with chemotherapy it can elicit antitumor responses in tumors that previously failed to respond to that chemotherapy . \n notably , cetuximab did not dramatically exacerbate the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy of the head and neck , including mucositis , xerostomia , dysphagia , pain , weight loss , and performance status deterioration . \n cetuximab has been approved for use in combination with radiation for treating patients with locally advanced hnscc   and as monotherapy for patients with recurrent hnscc . \n matuzumab ( formerly emd 72000 ) binds to egfr with high specificity and affinity to block receptor signaling , and also modulates antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( adcc ) when combined with cetuximab [ 5860 ] . \n phase i clinical trials report excellent antitumor activity of matuzumab against several human tumor types including head and neck cancers . \n a randomized phase iib , four - arm , open - label study recently assessed the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination with radiation therapy ( rt ) or chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) in patients with advanced ( stage iii or iva ) hnscc . \n the addition of nimotuzumab to both the radiation and chemoradiation regimens was reported to improve the overall response rate , survival rate at 30 months , median progression - free survival and median overall survival . \n a combined group analysis of the nimotuzumab arms versus the non - nimotuzumab arms demonstrated a significant difference in overall survival favoring nimotuzumab . \n this study is compelling as patient response rates compare favorably with studies combining cetuximab with radiotherapy , but with fewer side effects . \n gefitinib ( iressa ) is a small molecule tki - targeted to the intracellular active site for phosphorylation that has been tested in clinical trials involving hnscc patients , as a single agent or in combination with radiation treatment . \n unfortunately , gefitinib has shown limited clinical efficacy with response rates of 1015% [ 63 , 64 ] . \n erlotinib is a selective inhibitor of the egfr that also shows antitumor activity in hnscc comparable to standard combination chemotherapy . \n another promising rtk under preclinical and clinical evaluation for head and neck cancers includes the igf-1r ( reviewed in [ 66 , 67 ] ) . \n two ligands , insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf1 ) and igf2 bind to igf-1r . \n ligand binding to the igf-1r stimulates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , activating downstream signaling networks including ras - raf , mapk and erk , and pi3k ( figure 1 ) to drive cellular functions such as cell growth , survival and differentiation . \n it is widely accepted that the igf - axis activates antiapoptotic signaling , which in turn upregulates the pi3k - akt and mapk pathways in cancer cells . \n additionally , igf - ir also regulates vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) production , suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis . \n several studies indicate that igf-1r is overexpressed and functional in 94% of hnscc patient samples [ 70 , 71 ] . \n consistent with this , igf - ir signaling significantly enhances the proliferation , motility and tumorigenicity of human head and neck cancer cell lines . igf-1r \n down regulation in a hnscc cell line using antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a dose - dependent decrease in cellular proliferation , induction of apoptosis , caspase activation and reduced expression of proangiogenic cytokines such as vegf . \n interest in targeting the igf-1r in hnscc was bolstered by the observation that treatment of head and neck cancer cells with either igf or egf resulted in igf - ir and egfr heterodimerization [ 71 , 72 ] . \n however , only igf resulted in the phosphorylation of both receptors . using a mouse xenograft model for hnscc , treatment with antibodies against igf-1r , egfr or \n it remains to be determined whether cellular cross - talk between igf-1r and egfr has an important role in determining the biological aggressiveness of hnscc or resistance to egfr - targeted therapies . \n several monoclonal antibodies and tkis for igf-1r have been tested in preclinical studies and early phase clinical studies . \n however , the efficacy of igf-1r - targeted therapy for treating patients with hnscc , particularly cross - talk with egfr , warrants further investigation . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer cell lines [ 7375 ] . \n treatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] . targeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) . similarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) . \n these studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of anti - igf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc . \n the met receptor is a single pass transmembrane protein that upon binding its ligand hgf  also known as scatter factor - promotes increased cell proliferation , survival and motility ( reviewed in [ 78 , 79 ] ) . \n hgf is the only physiological ligand for met and is secreted as an inactive precursor polypeptide chain by mesenchymal cells . \n hgf is proteolytically cleaved to form an active / heterodimer by a number of serine proteases including urokinase plasminogen activator ( upa ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tpa ) , coagulation factors x. xi and xii . \n met is a disulphide - linked / heterodimer derived from the proteolytic cleavage of a 170  kda precursor . \n the  chain and n - terminal region of the -chain form  sema domain , a seven -propeller structure in which blades 2 and 3 bind to hgf . \n the sema domain is flanked by a cysteine - rich region followed by four immunoglobulin repeats . \n it is proposed that the cysteine - rich region and immunoglobulin repeat domains undergo a conformational change following hgf binding allowing for met dimerization [ 80 , 81 ] . \n binding of hgf to met results in receptor autophosphorylation at key catalytic residues and subsequent recruitment of several cytosolic signaling molecules that are shared with the egfr and igf-1r signaling pathways , including the grb2/sos complex , the p85 regulatory subunit of pi3k , gab1 and jak / stat3 ( figure 1 ) . \n subsequent activation of the mapk and jun - n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) pathways is responsible for the mitogenic and motogenic properties of met / hgf signaling resulting in  invasive growth  , depending on the physiological setting . \n increased met signaling in human cancers can be the result of enhanced ligand - binding ( autocrine and paracrine ) , met overexpression or missense mutations that often induce constitutive kinase activity , failure of met down regulation and interactions with other cell surface receptors such as egfr ( reviewed in [ 8284 ] ) . met is overexpressed in 84% of hnscc patient samples . \n interestingly , amplification of the met gene ( > 10 copies per cell ) is present only in 3 of 23 ( 13% ) tumor tissues . \n hgf overexpression is detected in 45% of hnsccs , suggesting that hgf functions predominantly in a paracrine manner to drive met signaling in these cancers . \n moreover , high levels of hgf are detected in hnscc patient plasma samples   supporting the idea that ligand availability is not a limiting factor for met activation . \n mutations in the met ligand - binding domain ( t230m / e168d ) , transmembrane or jm domain ( r988c , t1010i ) and the tyrosine kinase domain ( t1275i , v14333i ) have also been identified in hnscc tumor samples , although their relative contribution to hnscc progression remains to be determined . \n two somatic met mutations have been detected in hnscc that result in constitutively active receptor signaling that confers an invasive phenotype when ectopically expressed in cell lines . \n the y1230c mutation confers anchorage - independent growth and an invasive phenotype in transfected cells , whereas the y1235d met mutation stimulates epithelial cells to invade reconstituted basement membrane in the absence of hgf . in the case of the mety1235d mutation \n , genomic analyses of hnscc patient samples detected the presence of this mutant allele in 50% of metastatic tumors versus 26% in primary tumors , raising the possibility that this could be a critical genetic lesion for the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype . \n alternatively , increased met signaling could afford hnscc a selective advantage for growth and/or survival in metastatic sites , such as the lymph node and lung . \n indeed several studies indicate that met overexpression correlates highly with lymph node metastasis , pathologic stage , and disease reoccurrence [ 8891 ] . \n moreover , patient survival was significantly reduced in biopsy samples with positive met expression relative to negative met expression , suggesting the association of met with hnscc disease progression . \n consistent with these findings , treatment with the tki pf-2341066 caused a significant reduction in tumor growth , a high level of apoptosis and cellular debris within the tumor using a xenograft animal model for hnscc . \n selective inhibitors of met / hgf signaling include humanized monoclonal antibodies for hgf and met , and small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against met ( figure 1 ) . \n although their efficacy for treating a variety of solid tumors is increasingly recognized , we await results of preclinical and clinical trials for head and neck cancer that are ongoing . \n the humanized antibody amg 102 shows high potency towards the mature and processed form of hgf with no detected effects on proteolytic activation of prohgf . \n amg 102 interferes with met signaling , by competing with hgf for binding to the  chain of the met receptor . in phase \n i clinical studies in patients with advanced solid tumors , 70% of patients had a best response in terms of achieving stable disease [ 93 , 94 ] . \n importantly , no antiamg 102 antibodies were detected and circulating hgf levels were dose dependent . \n another promising clinical therapeutic is the one - armed 5d5 humanized antibody ( oa5d5/metmab ) directed against met . \n metmab binds met with high affinity , preventing hgf binding , met phosphorylation , receptor internalization and downstream signaling events and has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in animal models by more than 95% [ 95 , 96 ] . \n metmab is currently in phase i / ii human clinical trials in comparison with erlotinib in patients with nsclc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00854308 ) . \n future clinical trials will be required to determine the suitability of amg102 and metmab as either single agents or combinatorial therapeutics for treating hnscc patients . \n foretinib ( formerly xl880 ) is a tki whose primary targets include met and vegf , and to a lesser extent the platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) receptor , ron , kit and tie2 rtks . \n foretinib recently completed phase ii clinical trials in head and neck patients ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00725764 ) . \n interim results suggest that after 12 months , 12 of 18 patients had stable disease . \n a phase i dose - escalation study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of xl184 administered orally to patients with advanced malignancies ( showed that , on average , patients survived for more than 3 months with several up to 6 months while on treatment ) ( reviewed in ) . due to \n encouraging data from this study , a randomized phase iii trial of xl184 in hnscc patients was initiated to investigate xl184 as a first - line treatment ( compared with placebo ) for survival benefit to patients with hnscc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00704730 ) . \n arq197 ( arqule ) is a nonatp - site competitive , selective small molecule inhibitor of the met intracellular region . \n although the mechanism of arq197 is presently unknown , the results of phase i trials suggest potential antiinvasive activity for this compound . \n overall , met , and hgf - targeted therapies have been well tolerated in clinical trials with negligible toxicities . \n however , it remains to be determined whether met is a better therapeutic target than hgf . \n clearly , in patients where met is activated by autocrine hgf secretion , both hgf and met targeted therapies may prove to be more efficacious treatment options . \n acquired resistance is likely the result of several mechanisms including ( 1 ) egfr mutations initially present as well as those acquired during therapy , ( 2 ) receptor independent activation of downstream signaling cascades , ( 3 ) cross - talk with other rtks and converging signaling pathways and ( 4 ) environmental factors including inflammatory agents and viral infection . \n resistance to cetuximab has been associated with the coexpression of the truncated egfr mutant , egfrviii with wild - type egfr . \n egfrviii is the result of an in frame deletion of exons 27 spanning the extracellular ligand - binding domain . \n the deletion results in a truncated egfr receptor that signals in a ligand - independent manner . \n egfrviii expression has been detected in 42% of hnscc patient samples , and closely correlates with increased hnscc cell proliferation in vitro and increased tumor growth using in vivo xenograft models . \n egfrviii preferentially activates the pi3k pathway instead of the ras / raf / mek pathway , which is activated by wild - type egfr . of particular interest to the therapeutic treatment of hnscc , \n egfrviii expression decreases the proliferative response of egfr expressing tumor cells to cetuximab treatment relative to vector control cells . in a recent study , \n egfrviii cells were shown to be resistant to the antiinvasive effects of cetuximab due to an increase in phosphorylation of stat3 rather than increased pi3k signaling . \n egf - induced expression of the stat3 target gene hif1 was abolished by cetuximab in hnscc cells expressing wild - type egfr under hypoxic conditions , but not in egfrviii - expressing hnscc cells [ 102 , 103 ] . \n these data suggest a role for egfrviii in mediating hnscc resistance to cetuximab .   despite egfrs critical role in the development of hnscc \n , clinical data indicate modest clinical benefits for locoregional control and survival of head and neck cancer patients treated with egfr - targeted therapies . \n hnscc patients resistant to cetuximab , often succumb to local tumor recurrence as well as regional and distant metastasis . \n the addition of cetuximab to radiation therapy was reported to show improved locoregional disease control , progression - free survival , and overall survival in patients with locally advanced hnscc . \n however the data revealed a disproportionate benefit of cetuximab with radiotherapy to oropharyngeal cancer patients when compared to patients treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy . \n accumulating evidence suggests that human papilloma virus ( hpv ) 16 status ( hpv+ ) is an important prognostic factor associated with a favorable outcome in a subset of head and neck cancers , including oropharyngeal and tonsilar cancers . \n hpv+ tumors tend to have unique genetic aberrations including decreased egfr expression , whereas increased igf-1r levels characteristic of hnscc appear to be independent of hpv status . \n clinically , hpv+ tumors are characterized by more favorable patient prognosis regarding disease - free survival as well as overall survival [ 104 , 105 ] , possibly as a result of increased genomic stability associated with global gene hypermethylation in hpv+ tumors . \n thus it will be interesting to determine whether hpv+ status explains some of the benefits derived from the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy in this subset of hnscc patients . at present \n , there are few clinical indicators of which hnscc patients will most likely respond to egfr - targeted therapies . \n accordingly , strategies to optimize egfr - targeted therapy remain an active area of research . \n additional mechanisms that result in egfr activation include activating mutations in downstream signaling components or cross - talk between different rtk pathways . activating mutations in the pi3ka oncogene \n occurs in 10% of hnscc tumors   whereas elevated levels of phosphorylated stat3 correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor patient prognosis [ 108110 ] . \n conversely , h - ras mutations are infrequent in hnscc cases ( less than 5% ) , although a higher incidence has been detected in asian populations and correlates with areca nut chewing [ 111 , 112 ] . \n met signaling has been shown to contribute to resistance in cell lines derived from multiple tumor types including breast , gastric and lung . \n in one key study , nsclc with activating mutations in the egfr acquire resistance to the tki gefitinib and erlotinib , by amplification of the met gene to maintain akt and her3 signaling . \n these studies underscore the role of cross - talk between rtks to preferentially signal through the pi3k - akt survival pathway as a mechanism for acquired drug resistance . \n the relevance of met as a mechanism for escape from egfr - targeted therapy in head and neck cancers remains to be determined . \n hypoxia results in the transcriptional upregulation of met gene expression via hif1 in a number of tumors including head and neck , often downstream of egfr signaling . in normoxia \n , hydroxylation of 2 prolines in hif1 enables its binding to the von hippel - lindau tumor suppressor protein ( pvhl ) linking hif1 to a ubiquitin ligase complex . during hypoxia , minimal or no hydroxylation occurs enabling hif1 to avoid proteasomal degradation and \n dimerize to other hif family members such as hif1   and coactivators , to form an active transcriptional hif complex on the hypoxia response element ( hre ) of target genes such as met . \n the ubiquitin ligase catalyzes polyubiquitination of hif1 targeting it for proteasomal degradation . under hypoxic conditions , \n increased met signaling directs the invasive growth program , enabling cells to invade more oxygenated tissues . \n since met has been reported to promote invasive and angiogenic effects in the tumor microenvironment , the use of hgf / met inhibitors may afford a means of impairing tissue colonization as well as tumor vascularization in head and neck cancer patients . \n studies on other solid tumor types , most notably glioblastoma , indicate a role for igf-1r upregulation in resistance to egfr - targeted therapies . \n igf-1r mediates resistance to anti - egfr therapy in primary glioblastoma through the continued activation of the pi3k / akt survival pathway . \n the apparent cooperation between igf-1r and egfr in promoting hnscc pathogenesis as well as resistance to egfr - targeted therapy , suggests an advantage to cotargeting these signaling axes for the treatment of head and neck cancers . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer lines . \n treatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] . \n targeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) . \n similarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) . \n these studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of antiigf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc . \n targeted therapies that block egfr , met , and igf-1r signaling in head and neck cancers continue to show promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials . \n however , it is difficult to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapeutics and potential side effects during long - term in vivo use . given the interplay between these rtk signaling pathways and the mediocre results obtained with monotherapy regimens thus far , clinical trials will be required to determine how egfr- , met- , and igf-1r - targeted therapies can be used in combination in order to definitively abrogate their common downstream oncogenic signaling networks . \n although gaps in our knowledge concerning the role of met and igf-1r in head and neck tumorigenesis , as well as acquired resistance to antiegfr therapies remain to be addressed , efforts to translate current information towards clinical applications continue to be impressive .",
         "molecular therapeutics for treating epidermal growth factor receptor-(egfr- ) expressing cancers are a specific method for treating cancers compared to general cell loss with standard cytotoxic therapeutics . \n however , the finding that resistance to such therapy is common in clinical trials now dampens the initial enthusiasm over this targeted treatment . \n yet an improved molecular understanding of other receptor tyrosine kinases known to be active in cancer has revealed a rich network of cross - talk between receptor pathways with a key finding of common downstream signaling pathways . \n such cross talk may represent a key mechanism for resistance to egfr - directed therapy . \n here we review the interplay between egfr and met and the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) tyrosine kinases , as well as their contribution to anti - egfr therapeutic resistance in the context of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck , a tumor known to be primarily driven by egfr - related oncogenic signals .",

induced cell death through activation of enzymatic degradation , preservation of mitochondrial function , and inhibition of apoptotic cell death . \n clearly , mpp was found to significantly decrease the survival of dopaminergic neurons and increase the release of ldh into the culture medium . \n the mpp toxicity involves its selective uptake by dopaminergic neurons through the dopamine transporter and inhibition of mitochondrial complex i activity with subsequent mitochondrial depolarization.14 in parallel , the use of jc-1 fluorescence dye in our current study showed that mpp significantly decreased the m of cultured cells as indicated by the decreasing red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 . \n similar mpp - induced reduction of m was reported in other in vitro disease models.15,16 mitochondrial damage has long been implicated in the death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both pd patients and experimental models.17,18 staining of primary dopaminergic cultures with blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain showed that a significant number of the cells displayed features of apoptosis , most notably chromatin condensation , and fragmentation . \n previously , tang et al19 and xu et al16 demonstrated that mpp caused apoptotic cell death in pc12 and sh - sy5y cells . \n the mpp - induced apoptosis was reported to occur as the result of disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and opening of the permeability transition pore.20 similar to our previous report,9 co - treatment of primary mesencephalic cell cultures with tq and mpp was found to protect dopaminergic neurons and decreased the release of ldh into the culture medium . since that time , no evidence in the literature has shown how tq protected dopaminergic neurons in the primary mesencephalic cell culture . \n staining of cultures with lysotracker deep red showed that tq significantly increased the red fluorescence of the dye compared with mpp - treated cultures , indicating enhancement of the formation of many autophagolysosomes , the sites of lysosomal degradation , by tq . \n this is supported by the findings of he and klionsky21 who correlated the fluorescent signals of lysotracker deep red to the upregulation of autophagy in zebrafish . increased red fluorescence of lysotracker deep red \n is attributed to the formation of many autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes that retain much dye as the result of increasing their acidification . using jc-1 fluorescent dye showed that tq significantly enhanced m as it increased the red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 compared with mpp - treated cultures . \n the tq was similarly found to protect rat cortical neurons against ethanol- and a1 - 42-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of mitochondrial membrane depolarization.22,23 counting of apoptotic nuclei using blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain indicated that tq decreased mpp - induced apoptotic cell death in primary mesencephalic cell cultures . in accordance , \n ullah et al22 reported that tq inhibited apoptotic cell death in ethanol - treated rat cortical neurons and attributed this effect of tq to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity . \n zhang et al24 reported that mitochondrial clearance protected cultured cortical neurons against ischemia - reperfusion - induced cell damage . in conclusion , correlating such results would therefore suggest that tq might activate a lysosomal degradative process in dopaminergic neurons , where clearance of damaged mitochondria results in reduced mitochondria - mediated apoptotic cell death . \n this might raise the possibility of using tq as a potentially therapeutic intervention in pd patients . \n whenever a manuscript contains material ( tables , figures , etc . ) which is protected by copyright ( previously published ) , it is the obligation of the author to obtain written permission from the holder of the copyright ( usually the publisher ) to reproduce the material in neurosciences . \n please submit copies of the material from the source in which it was first published .",

         "the femoral head often leads to healing complications , while the more predictable prosthetic replacements are associated with poorer function and significant complications . \n the treatment of these fractures depends on the age of the patient , fracture displacement , bone quality , timing of surgery and activity level of the patient . \n displaced fractures in healthy , active patients are best treated by reduction and internal fixation . \n there are however , complications unique to femoral neck fractures which are almost impossible to predict . non - union and avascular necrosis \n non - union usually can definitely diagnosed within a year of fracture fixation with the same being achieved within 3  months at times . after non - union has been established , intervention is inevitable . \n the decision to proceed in the management of failed fixation is based on the careful consideration of various factors . in young patients \n revision internal fixation with cancellous or muscle pedicle bone grafting ( vascularised bone graft ) or an osteotomy results in useful outcome . \n we report a case of non - union of the fracture of the neck of the femur , who refused additional procedures after his non - union had been established . \n the study conforms to the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethical board . \n a 38-year old male businessman reported to the out door department of our hospital with a history of a fall from height . \n clinical and radiological examination revealed a displaced fracture of the neck of the femur which was graded as garden type 4 ( fig . \n the patient was operated within 24  h. intraoperatively the garden alignment index was used as a yardstick of acceptable reduction . \n the fracture was fixed with 3 ao 6.5  mm cannulated screws in an inverted triangle . \n onward the patient complained of persistent but mild groin pain on ambulation which was assisted . \n the patients conservative line was continued till 1  year when his symptoms continued and radiologically there was no progress . at this point \n twenty - six  months into the post operative followup the patients pain subsided and radiographs started showing signs of union . a radiograph taken 32  months after the fixation showed full union . \n non - union after femoral neck fracture can be defined as a lack of radiographic evidence of union 6  months after the fracture . \n delayed or non - union often manifests as continued pain with weight bearing beyond 3  months post fixation . \n incidence of non - union of femoral neck fractures has been reported to be between 2 and 22% and generally becomes apparent within 1  year [ 69 ] . \n 3radiograph at 32  months depicting union garden 4 type fracture of the neck of the femur showing persistent non - union at 2  years radiograph at 32  months depicting union anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation are the two important surgeon controlled factors that may contribute to outcome . \n the preferred treatment for symptomatic non - unions in the elderly is prosthetic replacement . in the young active patients , \n if failure is due to technical errors , revision open reduction and internal fixation may be adequate . \n our case demonstrates that as long as the implant is holding and the patient is regularly followed up good results might be expected in cases as far as 32  months into the post fixation period .",
         "fracture of the femoral neck continues to be a vexing clinical and therapeutic challenge for the orthopedic surgeon . \n the fracture has a propensity for non - union and avascular necrosis . \n it is a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon to decide when to intervene in a case with non - union where the implant continues to be in place . \n we present a case with persistent clinical and radiological non - union signs where the fracture eventually united after 32  months . \n the case bolsters the view that a continued conservative regime might entail good results in such situations .",

gamma and il-5 production and release , induced by the down - regulation of the t - cell activity , primarily involving the calcineurin binding and inactivation . \n however , we did observe eosinophils in skin biopsy in our case , probably since the biopsy was taken after one year of oral dapsone . \n our patient experienced a relevant improvement within 3 months of treatment with tacrolimus ointment after no response with intra lesional steroids , dapsone and cryo therapy . in conclusion \n , the previous reports and our observation suggest that topical tacrolimus may be a well -

         "in a recent issue of critical care , we presented a series of 13 patients undergoing post - cardiotomy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) with bivalirudin - based anticoagulation . \n after this series , we satisfactorily continued this experience , reaching about 20 patients treated . \n however , we think that a word of caution should be added to our recently published experience . owing to its pharmacological profile \n , bivalirudin is rapidly cleaved by proteolytic enzymes , and its half - life is about 25 minutes when the renal function is normal . \n the use of bivalirudin for cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb )   and ecmo   is a feasible option . \n however , it is recommended that , during cpb , blood stagnation in the circuit be avoided because the rapid cleavage of bivalirudin may result in thrombosis . \n the ecmo circuit is devoid of a reservoir , and therefore blood stagnation is usually not a circuit- related problem . \n conversely , under some circumstances , the cardiac chambers may act as a ' natural reservoir ' , which entails blood stagnation and the risk for spontaneous intracardiac thrombosis . \n this is particularly true in the case of a very large right or left atrium with insufficient venous drainage or the case of very poor ventricular systolic function with intraventricular blood stagnation . to avoid this condition \n , we think that maintaining a partial ecmo support , leaving a minimal degree of intracardiac blood flow , may be a reasonable choice . \n this may be checked by echocardiographic view of heart valve movement or simply by the observation of some degree of pulsatile arterial blood pressure . \n we think that , in the event of echocardiographic evidence of a ' smoke effect ' within one or more cardiac chambers , bivalirudin should be replaced by standard heparin anticoagulation . \n intracardiac thrombus formation during ecmo with heparin anticoagulation has been described as well , but the pharmacokinetic properties of heparin may limit the risk of thrombus formation due to blood stagnation . \n  \n ",
         "bivalirudin has been proposed as the sole anticoagulant in patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) or cardiopulmonary bypass . \n owing to the pharmacodynamic properties of bivalirudin , areas of blood stagnation should be carefully avoided in order to limit the risk of thrombosis . \n the ecmo circuit has no reservoir and is usually devoid of blood stagnation areas . \n conversely , under some circumstances , intracardiac blood stagnation areas may exist . in this case \n , there is a potential risk for the spontaneous formation of an intracardiac thrombus . \n we suggest that , under bivalirudin anticoagulation , a minimal degree of intracardiac blood flow with left heart valve movement is allowed .",

         "moraxella catarrhalis is a gram - negative , aerobic diplococcus human mucosal pathogen which causes middle ear infections in infants and children [ 13 ] , and it is one of the three major causes of otitis media along with streptococcus pneumonia and haemophilus influenzae . although moraxella catarrhalis is frequently found as a commensal of the upper respiratory tract , recently it has emerged as a genuine pathogen and is now considered an important cause of upper respiratory tract infections in healthy children and elderly people , lower respiratory tract infections in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 1 , 5 ] , and hospital - acquired pneumonia . \n amikacin , cefixime , fosfomycin , cefuroxime , cotrimoxazole , doxycycline , and erythromycin resistant strains of moraxella catarrhalis were isolated and the widespread production of a -1actamase enzyme renders the bacterium resistant to the penicillin [ 79 ] . \n this has led to the search for new and effective therapeutic alternatives among natural compounds . \n plants remain an important source of diverse chemical entities which have been used as drugs or provide scaffolds from which new drugs have been derived . \n the selection of a suitable candidate species for investigations can be done on the basis of long - term use by humans . \n this approach is based on an assumption that the active compounds isolated from such plants are likely to be safer than those derived from plant species with no history of human use . \n aristolochia is an important genus in the family of aristolochiaceae and is widespread across tropical asia , africa , and south america . \n it is used in traditional medicine as a gastric stimulant and in the treatment of cancer , lung inflammation , dysentery , and snakebites . \n it is also used in the treatment of tumors and malaria and for fevers , but its usage as an antimalarial is not recommended in its crude form . \n aristolochia bracteolata showed a definite positive effect on wound healing , with significant increase in the level of powerful antioxidant enzymes . \n the whole plant was used as a purgative , antipyretic , and anti - inflammatory . \n organic solvent extracts of the plant showed antibacterial activities while the water extract showed antifungal activity . \n although aristolochia has been used for thousands of years in many cultures for many indications due to its various pharmacological activities , it was later discovered that consuming these plants can certainly be dangerous . \n the genus of aristolochia contains a naturally carcinogenic compound aa which has been shown to be the cause of so - called chinese herb nephropathy or aa nephropathy [ 19 , 20 ] , and mutations in the cells of people who consume it , causes more mutations than two of the best - known environmental carcinogens : tobacco smoke and uv light [ 21 , 22 ] . \n there are many cases of nephropathy reported in the literature caused by the systemic and long term application of chinese snakeroot ( aristolochia fangchi ) ; this highlighted the risk of using preparations which contain aristolochic acids . \n although aristolochia is being known in many countries that is containing a toxic compound aa , but this has not stopped it from being a popular herbal remedy for thousands of years . \n it is still extensively used in india and in traditional chinese medicine for slimming , menstrual symptoms , and rheumatism . \n it is also widespread used in sudan and other african countries as one of the most effective herbal remedies for infectious diseases . \n therefore , it was our objective to assess the potential antimicrobial activity of aristolochia bracteolata using a bioassay - guided fractionation , in order to produce pure compound that can act as the lead compound in developing new , safe , and effective drug to replace the use of the harmful crude plant material . \n sephadex lh-20 ( pharmacia fine chemical co. ltd ) was used for column chromatography . precoated silica gel plates ( merck , kieselgel 60 f254 , 0.25  mm ) and precoated rp-18 f254s plates ( merck ) were used for thin -

gel chromatography ( chloroform - methanol ) to afford the titled ester ( 88% ) . \n h - nmr ( 400  mhz , cdcl3 , tms , r.t . )  ( ppm ) : 3.88 ( 3h , s ) , 4.06 ( 3hs ) , 6.38 ( 2h , s ) , 7.11 ( 1h , d , j = 7.8  hz ) , 7.72 ( 1h , dd , j = 7.8  hz , 8.0  hz ) , 7.77 ( 1h , s ) , 8.70 ( 1h , d , j = 8.0  hz ) , and 8.83 ( 1h , s ) . \n suspension of the tested bacteria ( 100  l of 10  cfu / ml ) was spread onto solid media plates . \n the sterile paper discs ( 6  mm in diameter ) which were impregnated with the plant extract ( 14  mg ) and pure compound ( 10100  g ) were placed aseptically over the bacterial culture on nutrient agar plates . \n after incubation at 37c for 24 hours , the zone of inhibition around the discs was measured by millimeter scale . \n sterile , blank paper discs impregnated with only sterile solvents served as negative control each time . \n the sterile paper discs ( 6  mm in diameter ) which were impregnated with individual extract were placed on the inoculated plates . \n these plates were incubated for 2472  h at 2528c and the growth was evaluated visually by comparing a particular plate with the negative control plates ( having only test fungi ) . \n the antifungal activity was evaluated by measuring the inhibition zone diameter ( in millimeter ) observed . \n the mic and mbc values were determined by broth dilution method in accordance with clsi methodology . \n bacterial strains were cultured for 24  h at 37c on nutrient broth and then suspended in sterile distilled water to give a final inoculum concentration of 1.5  1.0  10  cfu / ml . \n dilutions ranging from 1.56 to 400  g / ml of the compound were prepared in tubes including broth and dmso 10% ( v / v ) , in addition to one negative control ( broth + dmso 10% v / v + test microorganism ) to ensure that the final concentration of dmso in the assays did not interfere with the bacterial growth and one sterility control ( broth + dmso 10% v / v + test compound ) . \n a 100  l suspension of test microorganism was added to individual tubes and incubated at 37c for 24  h. the mic of the compound was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited the visible bacterial growth and the mbc was defined as the lowest concentration that prevented the growth of the organism after subculture onto antibiotic - free plates . \n initial steps in new drug discovery involve identification of new chemical entities , which can be either sourced through chemical synthesis or can be isolated from natural products through biological activity guided fractionation . \n bioassay - guided fractionation of the identified plant may lead to standardized extract or isolated bioactive lead compounds as the new drug . \n the whole plant of aristolochia bracteolata was extracted successively with meoh and subjected to liquid - liquid fractionation with n - hexane , chloroform , ethyl acetate , and n - butanol . \n the resulting fractions were tested for antibacterial and antifungal activities . the crude extract and chloroform fraction were significantly active against sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . and both standard strain and clinical isolates of moraxella catarrhalis and were moderately active against s. aureus , b. subtilis , and ps . \n the n - hexane fraction had moderate activity against s. aureus and b. subtilis while ethyl acetate fraction showed moderate activity against ps . \n the crude extract failed to inhibit the growth of all test fungi in addition to the following bacterial strains : klebsiella pneumoniae , escherichia coli , salmonella typhimurium , streptococcus pyogenes , streptococcus agalactiae , staphylococcus epidermidis , neisseria lactamicus , enterobacter cloacae , bacillus cereus , aeromonas hydrophila , salmonella typhi , vibrio cholerae , and yersinia enterocolitica . \n the chloroform soluble fraction was therefore selected for further chromatographic separations and resulted in the isolation of known compound aa-1 ( figure 1 ) . \n aa-1 showed strong activity against moraxella catarrhalis ( standard strain and clinical isolates ) and sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . \n ( table 2 ) , with equal mic and mbc values of 25 and 50  g / ml . both the piperonylic acid moiety of aa-1 ( figure 1 ) and aa-1-methyl ester showed no activity against bacteria ( table 2 ) , which suggests that the coexistence of phenanthrene ring and free carboxylic acid is essential for aa-1 antibacterial activity . \n bioguided fractionation of methanolic extract of aristolochia bracteolata led to isolation of aa-1 and its structure was elucidated by interpretation of its nmr and ms data and by comparison with those reported in the literature . \n electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( esims ) showed pseudomolecular ion signal at m / z 364.03 [ m + na ] and high resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry ( hr - fabms ) afforded m+1 ion signal at m / z 342.0620 which was corresponding to the molecular formula c17h12no7 ( calculated for 342.06138 ) . \n h nmr and c - nmr spectra were matched with those of aa-1 which were previously reported . \n two weak signals which did not show any correlation with proton in hsqc and hmbc spectroscopy were considered as quaternary carbons at positions 5 (  124.3  ppm ) and 6 (  143.5  ppm ) , respectively . \n laboratories of the world have found literally thousands of phytochemicals which have inhibitory effects on all types of microorganisms in vitro . \n more of these compounds should be subjected to animal and human studies to determine their effectiveness in whole - organism systems , including in particular toxicity studies and an examination of their effects on beneficial normal microbiota . in spite of \n the fact that herbal remedy is a mixture of many chemicals in unknown doses and might result in unpleasant side effects , many people believe that treatments that are natural are somehow magically safe and effective . \n aristolochia is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases [ 13 , 15 ] , including those associated with bacteria . \n this study showed clearly that the excellent effect of aristolochia in treating such diseases is due to the toxic compound aa-1 . \n although aa-1 is highly effective in killing m. catarrhalis , it is ineffective against the other microorganisms tested . \n this highlights the importance of m. catarrhalis in discovering the cellular target of aa-1 and the mechanism of aa-1 toxicity . \n the widespread use of aristolochia is not sufficient to ensure that it is effective or even that it is safe . \n therefore , hit - to - lead exploration is necessary to identify related compounds with low toxicity , low cost , and improved potency that can replace the use of the harmful crude plant material . \n it is impossible to ban the use of these remedies , especially in the rural areas in sudan and other african countries ; therefore , we strongly recommend educating the public of the risks versus the benefits of aristolochia and gradually replacing them with either economical new drugs or standardized extracts and homogenous batches of other plant material with known levels of safe active constituents . \n using bioassay - guided fractionation technique , the present study directly linked the antibacterial activity of aristolochia bracteolata to the aa-1 . \n although aa-1 had strong activity against m. catarrhalis , it had a narrow spectrum of activity than expected based on the activity of the crude extract from which it was isolated or from its traditional usage . \n this may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or may be due to placebo effect .",
         "a bioassay - guided fractionation of methanol extract of aristolochia bracteolata whole plant was carried out in order to evaluate its antimicrobial activity and to identify the active compounds in this extract . \n antibacterial and antifungal activities of methanol extract against gram - positive , gram - negative , and fungal strains were investigated by the agar disk diffusion method . among the strains tested , moraxella catarrhalis and sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . \n showed the highest sensitivity towards the methanol extract and hence they are used as test organisms for the bioassay - guided fractionation . from this \n extract , aristolochic acid 1 ( aa-1 ) has been isolated and has showed the greatest antibacterial activity against both standard strain and clinical isolates of moraxella catarrhalis with equal minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) and minimum bactericidal concentration ( mbc ) values of 25 and 50  g / ml . modification of the aa-1 to aa-1 methyl ester completely abolished the antibacterial activity of the compound and the piperonylic acid moiety of aa-1 which suggested that the coexistence of phenanthrene ring and free carboxylic acid is essential for aa-1 antibacterial activity .",

         "anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ancas ) correlate well with a wide spectrum of vasculitis manifestations , including wegener 's granulomatosis , microscopic polyangiitis , and churg - strauss syndrome , all of which are commonly referred to as anca - associated vasculitis ( 1 ) . \n several infections , particularly infective endocarditis , have been reported to show positive findings on anca tests ; furthermore , their clinical features have been acknowledged to mimic anca - associated vasculitis , which may lead to a misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment ( 2,3 ) . \n however , to our knowledge , infected aortic aneurysms have not been reported to show positive findings on anca tests . \n we herein report a patient with an infected thoracic aortic aneurysm mimicking anti - proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( pr3-anca)-associated vasculitis . \n vegetations in the descending aorta , which were detected using transesophageal echocardiography , contributed to the diagnosis in this case . \n a woman in her 60s was admitted to the nagoya city university hospital complaining of a fever , which had persisted for three weeks , along with a loss of appetite , proteinuria , hematuria , and renal dysfunction . \n her renal function test values had been in the normal range three months prior to the admission . \n she also had a history of orbital mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma , which was in remission after treatment with only radiation therapy . \n a physical examination at the time of admission revealed a body temperature of 38.1 , pulse rate 109 beats / min , and blood pressure 104/53 mmhg . \n the laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 18,900/mm , hemoglobin 6.6 g / dl , blood urea nitrogen 30.8 mg / dl , serum creatinine 2.24 mg / dl , and c - reactive protein ( crp ) 9.44 mg / dl ( table ) . \n the pr3-anca titer was 47.4 iu / ml ( normal range < 10 iu / ml ) , although her myeloperoxidase - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( mpo - anca ) titer was not elevated . \n a urinalysis gave results of 2 + for protein and 3 + for occult blood in a dipstick examination , and a microscopic examination detected more than 100 red blood cells per high - power field . \n alt : alanine aminotransferase , ana : antinuclear antibodies , ast : aspartate transaminase , c3 : compliment 3 , c4 : compliment 4 , ch50 : 50% hemolytic unit of complement , crp : c - reactive protein , dna : deoxyribonucleic acid , ldh : lactate dehydrogenase , mpo - anca : myeloperoxidase - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody , rf : rheumatic factor , pr3-anca : anti - proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody she was initially diagnosed with pr3-anca - associated vasculitis and was thereafter treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy ( 500 mg / day ) for three days ( fig . \n however , streptococcus sanguis was serially detected in blood cultures ; therefore , the administration of steroids was stopped . \n transesophageal echocardiography also revealed no vegetation in the heart ; however , it showed many oscillating masses attached to the intima in the descending aorta ( fig . \n 2 ) . contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) revealed a new descending aortic aneurysm ( fig . \n effects of antibiotics on fever and c - reactive protein during hospitalization . the patient finally became afebrile and has c - reactive protein levels within the normal range after receiving antibiotics . \n crp : c - reactive protein , dap : daptomycin , pcg : penicillin g , taz / pipc : tazobactam / piperacillin , tx : therapy transesophageal echocardiographic images of the descending aorta , with sectioning planes at 90 ( a ) and 0 ( b ) . \n many oscillating masses attached to the intima were seen in the lumen of the descending aorta . \n contrast - enhanced computed tomographic images in the axial ( a ) and frontal ( b ) sections . \n these images show a descending aortic pseudoaneurysm and a contrast defect ( arrow ) beside the aneurysm that is compatible with echo - documented vegetation . \n based on the results of microbiological testing , antibiotic treatment with intravenous penicillin g ( 24,000,000 unit / day ) was started , after which she became afebrile . \n we added intravenous daptomycin ( 300 mg every 24 hours ) and tazobactam / piperacillin ( 2.25 g every 6 hours ) to the penicillin g because recurrent fever was observed two weeks later . \n this additional antibiotic treatment made her afebrile again , and her renal function was recovered ( fig . \n , she developed a janeway lesion , which was confirmed by the pathological finding of a skin biopsy specimen ( fig . \n 4 ) . transesophageal echocardiography finally demonstrated that the vegetation had disappeared after the antibiotic treatment ( fig . \n 5 ) , but contrast - enhanced ct revealed that the aneurysm remained unchanged in form . a nontender hemorrhagic macular on the sole of the foot ( a ) . \n photomicrograph of the macular lesion shows microembolization with fibrin and infiltration of neutrophilic cells hematoxylin and eosin staining ( b , c ) . \n a transesophageal echocardiographic image of the descending aorta after the antibiotic treatment , with the sectioning plane at 90. many oscillating masses have disappeared . on the 54th hospital day , she underwent endovascular aortic repair ( evar ) of the aneurysm ( fig . \n 6 ) after confirmation that her crp level was in the normal range and once blood cultures were consistently negative . \n one year after the procedure , she continues to take oral antibiotics ; no complications related to stent - graft deployment or recurrent infections have been encountered . \n her pr3-anca titer has normalized . a contrast - enhanced computed tomographic image after endovascular stent graft repair . \n in this case , an infected aortic aneurysm exhibited elevated the patient 's pr3-anca level , and its clinical course mimicked pr3-anca - associated vasculitis . \n the detection of ancas is highly specific for a diagnosis of anca - associated vasculitis ( 4 ) ; however , a number of infections can result in a positive anca test . \n there are several reports of infective endocarditis with the presence of ancas that mimic the clinical manifestations of an anca - associated vasculitis such as glomerulonephritis ( 2,3 ) . in the present case , based on the finding of positive blood cultures \n , we suspected that the patient was experiencing not anca - associated vasculitis but infective endocarditis . \n however , no vegetations were detected in the cardiac chambers using transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography . \n instead , contrast - enhanced ct revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the descending aorta , which suggested that the patient had an infected aneurysm . \n her renal dysfunction and elevated pr3-anca levels normalized with clinical resolution of the infected aneurysm after the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and evar . \n the patient has remained free of any evidence of systemic vasculitis during follow - up . \n the presence of pr3-anca may have been falsely positive in the present patient . to our knowledge , this is the first report of an infected aortic aneurysm with a positive pr3-anca test and clinical features mimicking anca - associated vasculitis . \n the presence of vegetations in the heart is one of the most characteristic findings of infective endocarditis . \n these vegetations are composed of bacteria , platelets , and inflammatory cells interspersed with fibrin mesh , either on damaged endocardium , including native cardiac valves , or prosthetic valves ( 5 ) . in the present case , \n because these masses disappeared after antibiotic treatment , they were considered to be vegetations . a pathological examination of the macular hemorrhages on the patient 's sole indicated not a cholesterol embolization but rather a janeway lesion , which was the consequence of septic embolic events . \n we therefore suspected that these masses were not mobile plaques but bacterial vegetations . to our knowledge , \n few cases of infected native aortic aneurysm manifesting vegetations in the aneurysm have been reported ( 6 - 8 ) . \n several mechanisms have been proposed regarding how ancas are formed during the course of infection , such as autoantigen complementarity , molecular mimicry , epigenetics , neutrophil extracellular traps , and microbial - sensing proteins called toll - like receptors ( 9 ) . there may be a great degree of overlap in the clinical and laboratory manifestations between anca - associated vasculitis and anca - positive infected aortic aneurysm , potentially leading to a misdiagnosis . \n it is important to correctly diagnose these cases in order to avoid administering inappropriate therapy , such as immunosuppressive treatment , which might have life - threatening consequences in a patient with an infected aortic aneurysm . \n positive blood cultures and imaging findings , such as a pseudoaneurysm and/or vegetations in the aorta , suggest the presence of an infected aortic aneurysm . a combination of conventional surgical treatment with resection of the aneurysm , extensive local debridement , and revascularization by in situ reconstruction or extra - anatomic bypass may be the gold standard , but such a treatment strategy is accompanied by a high mortality and morbidity . in the present case , \n it was recently reported that evar of an infected aortic aneurysm is feasible and , for most patients , a durable treatment option ( 10 ) . \n given that the continuous administration of antibiotics for the infected aneurysm should prevent a recurrence of local infection , we continued using antibiotics until the infection was controlled and carefully monitored the shape of the pseudoaneurysm on contrast - enhanced ct . \n we were ready to perform an emergency surgical correction at any point during this patient 's treatment course . in conclusion \n , we herein reported an unusual case of infected descending aortic pseudoaneurysm with luminal pathognomonic oscillating vegetation and with serological findings and clinical features mimicking pr3-anca - associated vasculitis . \n ",

         "endometriosis is a prevalent cause of infertility , pelvic pain , dysmenorrhea , and dyspareunia in reproductive - age women . \n its diagnosis is by inspection of the pelvis during laparoscopy . in women with pelvic pain and infertility , \n endometriosis mimics some autoimmune and malignant diseases , including familial occurrence and immunological abnormalities in b and t cells , increased angiogenesis , invasion of endometrial cells to adjacent organs ( e.g. , bladder and bowels ) , and need for repeat surgeries due to recurrence [ 1,57 ] . \n multiple mechanisms for etiology and improvement of endometriosis are suggested and the treatments are based on these unclear mechanisms . therefore , progestin , gnrh agonists and antagonists , and drugs related to lipid metabolism ( e.g. , simvastatin ) are used for treatment . \n it has been shown that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of endometriosis , so endometriosis treatment should not be different from that of other inflammatory disorders \n . there may be a correlation between vitamin d levels and the risk of polycystic ovarian disease , endometriosis , breast and ovarian cancer , increased arterial stiffness in older patients , and myasthenia gravis [ 1218 ] . \n it has been found that vitamin d has a role in normal cellular growth regulation . \n vitamin d increases anti - inflammatory cytokines production and decreases pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 1922 ] . \n vitamin d induces apoptosis and suppression of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo [ 2528 ] . \n although an indirect relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been reported in multiple studies , here has been no published randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women . \n we explored the relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis in a double - blind , randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of vitamin d supplementation on cessation of pain in proven endometriosis after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment . \n this randomized , double - blind clinical trial was performed in a single tertiary university hospital from nov 2014 to feb 2016 . to find patients with endometriosis , we did laparoscopy for various indications , including ovarian cyst , infertility , pelvic pain , and dysmenorrhea . \n using laparoscopy , the surgeons diagnosed patients with endometriosis and tried to excise or ablate all diseased tissue . the day before laparoscopy \n , a data collection form was completed by a physician , including the reason for laparoscopy , and the severity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea were estimated using a visual analogue scale test ( vas test ) , with a score of 0 being no pain and a score 10 being the worst pain ever experienced . \n the laparoscopies were done by 2 gynecologic laparoscopic surgeons ; both were involved in each operation and they recorded the severity of endometriosis according to the revised american society for reproductive medicine ( asrm ) classification . in the patients with endometriosis in the second menses after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment , the vas test was repeated . \n patients with vas scores of at least 3 for dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain were invited to participate in this clinical trial , and after consultation we asked them to sign the informed consent . \n the dyspareunia score was not a criterion for entering the study because some of the patients were not married and had not had intercourse . \n women aged 1540 years with proven endometriosis by laparoscopy and a vas test score of 3 or more for dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain at second menses after operative laparoscopy . \n patients with vitamin d treatment in the last 6 months prior to surgery ; patients with known systemic diseases ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes , coronary , renal , and hepatic diseases ) ; patients with known malignancy ; patients with hormonal treatment , including oral contraceptive pills , in the last 6 months . after authorization by the university ethics committee , \n eligible patients were assigned by simple randomization to receive either vitamin d or placebo . in the vitamin d group ( d group ) , we prescribed oral vitamin d 50 000 iu / weekly for 12 weeks ( capsule d -

up and continued their treatment until the end of the study . \n in this double - blind , randomized clinical trial , at 24 weeks after laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis there was no significant difference between effect of vitamin d3 ( cholecalciferol ) and placebo on severity of dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain . \n this is the first clinical trial on women with endometriosis to explore the possible relationship between vitamin d treatment and relief of endometriosis - related pain . \n our literature search found only studies that were indirectly related to vitamin d and endometriosis [ 2743 ] . \n the etiology of endometriosis is poorly understood , and many etiologic factors have been suggested , including the serum level of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 . \n 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 is a fat - soluble vitamin with an unclear role in endometriosis . \n it is suggested that nuclear vitamin d receptors can have a regulatory role in inflammation and can be used as an index of cellular metabolic health . a study on vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism in endometriosis compared 132 infertile women with endometriosis with 132 fertile women , reporting no significant difference and suggesting that vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis . in some studies , \n higher plasma levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 and higher intake of dairy foods was associated with lower risk of endometriosis . \n conversely , another study compared serum vitamin d levels of 87 women with endometriosis with 53 women without endometriosis ; the mean serum levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 in women with and without endometriosis were 24.914.8 ng / ml and 20.411.8 , respectively ( p=0.05 ) and the study concluded that endometriosis is associated with higher serum levels of vitamin d . \n a systematic review of 10 case - control studies and 1 cohort study on women s diet found that women with endometriosis had lower consumption of vegetables and omega-3 , and reported a significant association between diet and endometriosis . \n vitamin d binding protein ( dbp ) is a plasma glycoprotein that modulates immune and inflammatory responses and also controls transport of vitamin d metabolites and bone development . in a study \n comparing 13 ectopic endometrial tissues and 6 normal endometrial tissues , vitamin d binding protein was significantly higher in the ectopic endometrial tissues ( p<0.05 ) . \n a systematic review of research from 1946 to 2013 on vitamin d and endometriosis reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of vitamin d binding protein . \n another study compared serum and peritoneal levels of dbp in 26 women with endometriosis and 17 women with other benign gynecological conditions and reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of dbp than in the control group . \n a study comparing urinary levels of dbp in 57 women with endometriosis with levels in 38 controls found that the urinary level of dbp was significantly higher in patients with endometriosis . \n a study using a rat model of endometriosis reported that treatment with vitamin d3 produced fibrosis and apoptosis in the stroma of tissues with endometriosis . a study on induced endometriosis in adult balb female mice reported that administration of 100 g / kg / day elocalcitol ( a vitamin d receptor agonist ) for 3 weeks reduced total lesion weight . because a relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been suggested by multiple studies , and since there has been no randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women , we decided to explore this relationship . in the present study on endometriosis - related pain \n , we found no significant difference in results of vitamin d treatment vs. placebo at 24 weeks after surgical diagnosis and treatment . \n vitamin d is a fat - soluble vitamin mainly produced in the body from food and supplements and cutaneous sun exposure . \n vitamin d deficiency is defined as serum 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 levels under 20 ng / ml . \n it is reported in 52% of black and hispanic adolescents in boston and in 48% of girls in maine , and it is seen in 40100% of elderly men and women in the usa and europe . a study in germany found that 57% of people \n 1879 years old were vitamin d deficient . the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency was reported to be 90% in healthy subjects in delhi , india . in a systematic review of 195 studies in 44 countries found that 37.3% of studies found that the mean serum vitamin d levels were less than 20 ng / ml . \n the prevalence in pregnant turkish women was 81.4% . in a study of high school students in iran , \n the serum mean vitamin d level was 14.79.4 ng / ml . in another study in university students in shiraz , iran , 51.2% of female students had low serum levels of vitamin d . because the incidence of vitamin d deficiency in iran is high and we did not check the serum vitamin d levels in samples before intervention , it is possible that this dose and duration of vitamin d prescription was beneficial only for treatment of vitamin d deficiency and not endometriosis . in 1072 women attending an infertility center , \n an in vitro study compared the effect of vitamin d3 on 25 human endometriosis stromal cell cultures ( ovarian endometrioma ) with the effect of vitamin d3 on culture of 20 endometrial samples of non - endometriosis women ; vitamin d3 inhibited proliferation , invasion , and pro - inflammatory cytokine production in endometriosis and reduced production of interleukin 6 and other inflammatory cytokines that stimulate adhesion of endometrial cells to the peritoneal cavity . a study on in vitro effects of vitamin d3 on human endometriosis stromal cells found that vitamin d3 significantly reduced interleukin 1 and tumor necrotizing factor- inflammatory responses , and also reported fewer endometrial stromal cells and reduced dna synthesis . \n the study found significantly lower serum vitamin d3 levels in severe endometriosis compared to normal controls and patients with mild endometriosis . a study in italy investigated the effect of vitamin d on primary dysmenorrhea . \n the samples were 40 women aged 1840 years old with 4 consecutive painful periods in the past 6 months . \n they measured the serum levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d with high - performance liquid chromatography . \n then the women were randomized into a group of 20 women who received a single oral dose of 300 000 iu vitamin d ( cholecalciferol ) at 5 days before their next menstrual cycle and another group of 20 women received placebo . \n there was a negative correlation between the baseline dysmenorrhea pain score and the level of 25 hydroxy vitamin d3 ( r=0.36 , p=0.2 ) . \n the researchers found a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in the vitamin d group in comparison with the placebo group in the next 2 menstruations ( p<0.01 ) . \n they suggested this significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in vitamin d prescription group was due to decreased levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and decreased the biological activity of prostaglandins . \n the samples were not assessed for existing endometriosis . because low levels of serum vitamin d are common in healthy italian pre - menopausal women , these results only show that vitamin d was effective in relieving dysmenorrhea at least for 2 months after treatment in women with or without endometriosis and also in women with or without vitamin d deficiency . \n there may be a relationship between vitamin d and pathogenesis of endometriosis , but in our study vitamin d was not effective in treatment of endometriosis - related pain . \n larger clinical trials are needed to determine the possible effects of vitamin d supplementation in endometriosis treatment . \n the first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our country and worldwide , meaning that a high percentage of our samples may have had vitamin d deficiency , which may have affected the results of our research . \n further clinical trials are needed on the role of vitamin d treatment for endometriosis -

         "it is generally accepted that microleakage between the filling materials and root canal \n walls might adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment . \n therefore , it is critical the complete \n sealing of the root canal system after cleaning and shaping in order to avoid the \n bacterial penetration and re - infection of the root and periapical tissues . \n the association of gutta - percha cones \n and root canal sealer has been traditionally used for this purpose . however , in the last \n decade , the dentin adhesive technology has been incorporated into the root canal filling \n techniques to reduce apical and coronal leakage by bonding to root canal walls . \n etch - and - rinse adhesives have been \n tested with resin cements and the \n combination of a dentin - bonding agent and an epoxy resin - based root canal sealer \n significantly reduced apical leakage . in restorative dentistry , the self - etch adhesive systems have shown less technique \n sensitivity , with reliable long - term performance of a two - step mild self - etch \n adhesive . following this trend , \n pentron clinical technologies \n ( wallingford , ct , usa ) has developed the epiphany system , which contains a self - etch \n primer , a dual - cured composite resin sealer and a polyester - based thermoplastic \n root - filling material ( resilon ; resilon research llc , madison , ct , usa ) . \n according to shipper , et al . \n ( 2004 ) \n this material has been shown to be more resistant to bacterial leakage than epoxy \n resin - based sealers for filling root canals . in endodontics , \n the controversy about the performance of adhesive systems inside the \n root canal remains . despite that , \n other possibility is combining epiphany primer with ah plus in an attempt to add the \n hybridization capacity to the gold standard endodontic sealer . \n the reason for this is \n that the removal of the smear layer with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ) does \n not provide the same etching pattern usually associated with the hybrid layer , which is \n considered an important factor for dentin bonding . \n the majority of studies have evaluated apical or coronal microleakage , and few have \n focused gap formation at the dentin / sealer interface . \n so far , no correlation between microleakage and gap \n formation has been established in the literature . \n thus , it is reasonable to believe that \n the association of both methods would provide a more precise evaluation of the adhesive \n interface . \n the aim of this study was to compare the apical sealing and gap formation of ah \n plus / gutta - percha with epiphany system . \n in addition , the opportunity was taken to assess \n the effect of the association of epiphany primer and ah plus / gutta - percha on apical \n sealing and gap formation . \n the null hypotheses tested were as follows : ( 1 ) there is no \n difference in apical microleakage or ( 2 ) apical gap formation among the experimental \n groups and ( 3 ) there is no correspondence between apical microleakage and the presence \n of gaps . \n thirty - nine lower single - rooted human premolars with straight root canals and fully \n developed apices ( local ethics committee approval 177/05 ) were cleaned and submitted \n to 18.5 kgy gamacell radiation ( nuclear energy research institute , so paulo , \n sp , brazil ) , and stored in saline solution at 4c . \n after endodontic access , \n the real working length ( rwl ) was established 1 mm short of the apical foramen . \n a \n crown -

absence of \n leakage ; ( inf.1 ) - leakage up to the 1 millimeter ; ( inf.2 ) \n leakage \n up to the 2 mm ; ( inf.3 )  leakage up to the 3 \n millimeter ; ( inf.5 )  leakage up to the 5 millimeter ; ( f.0 )  absence \n of gaps ; ( f.1 )  gaps type 1 ; ( f.2 ) - gaps types 1 and 2 . \n the absence of leakage \n is associated with the absence of gap ; leakage up to the 1 millimeter \n is associated with type 1 ; and more extensive leakage is associated with types 1 \n and 2 frequency and type of gaps in the apical 5 mm of root canal fillings percentage of regions with gaps . \n type 0 : absence of gaps ; type 1 : gaps between \n dentin and sealer ; type 2 gaps between sealer and cone the generalized linear model with poisson distribution ( table 1 ) found no difference between ah plus and ah primer ( p=0.497 ) in \n distribution of each type of gap , but they presented more type 0 regions \n ( p<0.001 ) . \n there was a significant interaction between epiphany and the type of \n gap ( p<0.003 ) and for this group , there were more type 1 regions . \n based on the findings of this study , the first null hypothesis could not be rejected . \n recently some studies have shown similar results between ah plus and epiphany on apical \n sealing ability using the fluid filtration method . \n consistent with these \n studies , our results indicate that the epiphany system is as effective as ah \n plus / gutta - percha in preventing microleakage based on the chemical tracer penetration \n analysis by sem and the use of epiphany primer does not reduce the microleakage of ah \n plus . nevertheless , other researches pointed out that the epiphany system provided the \n greatest resistance to the movement of fluids or dye leakage \n test , when compared to epoxy \n resin - based root canal sealers , but others have just indicated the opposite . \n these apparent discrepancies can perhaps be explained by the \n methodology used and their variables . \n these results agree with those of previous studies in which , microleakage markers were \n used to evaluate apical sealing of the same endodontic sealers . \n the tracer \n selected was agno3 , which may penetrate into dentinal tubules due to their \n physical and chemical characteristics including : concentration , smaller molecular size , \n its neutral ph , diffusion coefficient and service life up to 168 h post - preparation time of \n solution . \n another reason for \n this choice is that metallic silver deposits may be observed by sem using back scattered \n electrons ( bse ) mode . on the other hand , \n the results of the current study disagree with the findings of \n shipper , et al . \n an \n explanation for this would be that their studies have evaluated coronal and not apical \n bacterial leakage . indeed , coronal seal might be favorably influenced by photoactivation \n of the material which is unlikely to occur in the apical third . \n furthermore , it is speculated that in in \n vivo studies ( dogs ) , the high release of calcium hydroxide ( 41.46 mg / l ) that \n would occur during the process of epiphany sealer solubilization , would make the medium \n alkaline , resulting in acceleration of the periapical tissue repair process . \n this study has shown that the presence of apical gaps at the sealer / dentin or \n sealer / cone interfaces had an effect on apical microleakage . \n the epiphany group \n presented more type 1 gaps than the other groups ( table \n 1 ) , rejecting the second null hypothesis . \n these results corroborate with \n previous observation of gaps in the apical 4 mm of epiphany or ah plus - filled root \n canals . \n stress generated \n during the polymerization shrinkage of epiphany sealer has probably influenced the \n integrity loss at the sealer / dentin interface . \n in addition , the cavity configuration factor ( c - factor ) is \n highly unfavorable for adhesion inside root canals . \n moreover , it is known that analysis of gap formation of \n vertically sectioned root filled teeth hides the risk of artifacts during sectioning . \n therefore , in this study , the sections were made at low speed under water cooling . \n the \n resin - epoxy replicas at the dentin / sealer and sealer / cone interfaces were made before \n the specimens had been prepared for sem examination in order to differentiate genuine \n gaps from artifactual gaps created after vacuum desiccation in conventional scanning \n electron microscopes . \n few studies have focused on apical sealing from two separate perspectives , such as \n microleakage and apical gap formation . \n sem was used to evaluate these perspectives , but it was restricted to a descriptive \n approach . \n a systematization of the observations , complemented by a statistical analysis , such as \n the one performed in this study , could provide greater methodological accuracy and \n impartiality for comparing the experimental groups . \n the correspondence of analysis \n between the types of gaps and linear extent of agno3 leakage ( fig . \n 3 ) confirms the effect of gaps on apical \n microleakage , expressed by the silver deposition into gaps that extended deeply inside \n dentinal tubules ( fig . \n regarding to statistical analysis , the ordinal logistic regression analysis model was \n used due to microleakage was considered categorized ordinal response variable ( ranging \n from 0 - no leakage to 5 - leakage up to the fifth millimeter ) . \n the correspondence \n analysis is a method that leads to visualize the association between two categorical \n variables , in this case microleakage and the type of gap . \n the generalized linear model \n with poisson which is an extension of usual regression model was performed to quantify \n the distribution of types of gaps . \n this result could be explained by two hypotheses : ( 1 ) \n the low degree of conversion of the epiphany sealer and ( 2 ) the formation of hydrogel at the bond interface resulting \n from the incomplete evaporation of the epiphany primer solvent . \n the second hypothesis could also explain the inefficacy \n of epiphany primer in improving the sealing capacity of ah plus . \n moreover , there is a \n chemical incompatibility between these two materials , since the epoxy resin sealers do \n not copolymerize with methacrylate resin - based adhesives . \n other studies should be carried out to clarify the \n sealing ability of the root - filled materials studied . \n it may be concluded that none of the tested materials completely sealed the apical 5 mm . \n the presence \n of gaps had an effect on apical microleakage for all materials . comparing the materials , \n epiphany system presented more regions containing gaps between the dentin and the sealer \n ( type 1 ) . in view of these findings , \n clinically , it can be suggested that ah plus would \n provide a better apical seal . \n this study was partially supported by capes ( coordenao de \n aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior)/institutional \n qualification program ( pqi n : 0090/03 -

these first adhesions are , however mechanically and biologically unstable . \n few minutes after this first , reversible phase , bacterial clusters attached to the surface starts to express biofilm related genes , produce glycocalyx and form mature biofilm , thus transforming the adhesion from reversible to irreversible 16 . \n full - formed biofilm can be found few hours after the first bacterial adhesion 17 . \n antimicrobial surface coatings can be based on an anti - adhesive principle that prevents bacteria to adhere and form biofilms 18 . \n in fact , some polymer coatings , like the hydrophilic polymethacrylic acid , polyethylene oxide or protein - resistant polyethylene glycol can be applied to the surface of titanium implants and result in significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion 19 - 22 . \n hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surface treatment technologies have also shown a great repellent antibacterial effect in preclinical studies 23 - 25 . \n however , clinical application of completely novel coating technologies and compounds , not otherwise previously tested in humans , appears particularly challenging 26 . \n bacterial colonization can also be blocked by an inhibitor interfering with ligand - receptor interaction for bacterial attachment . \n one of these inhibitors could be hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , a glycosaminoglycan made up of glucuronic acid and n - acetylglucosamine disaccharide units . \n it is a uniform , linear and unbranched molecule , with highly variable length and molecular weight ( up to 106 da ) . \n it is abundant in skin ( up to 56% ) and in connective tissues , with a turnover ranging from several hours to a few days depending on tissues . \n hyaluronic acid constitutes one of the main components of extracellular matrices . because of its biological properties , ha has several clinical applications ( aesthetic surgery , dermatology , dentistry , orthopedics and opthalmology ) 27 . \n extensive studies on the chemical and physicochemical properties of ha and its physiological role in humans , together with its versatile properties , such as its biocompatibility , non - immunogenicity , biodegradability , and viscoelasticity , have proved that it is an ideal biomaterial for medical and pharmaceutical applications 28 , 29 . among its various properties , \n several studies have recently shown the ability of ha to protect against various infectious agents 30 , depending on ha concentration and molecular weight 31 , 32 , while more recently ha interference on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has been extensively investigated 33 . \n given its high biocompatibility and well known safety profile and the anti - adhesive capabilities , ha and its composites represent an attractive , non - antibiotic , option to mitigate the impact of biofilm - related infections in various clinical settings including implant - related infections . aim of this review is to provide an update of the current evidence concerning ha ability to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation . \n nearly two decades ago , pavesio et al . 34 were probably the first to describe the ability of ha to resist bacterial adhesion , with particular reference to staphylococcus epidermidis , and its non - fouling properties 35 , proposing coated polymeric medical devices ( e.g. , intraocular lenses , stents and catheters ) to reduce implant - related infections . \n in particular , a hydrophilic ha overlayer , linked to the surface of polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses ( iols ) , was shown to be able to prevent fibroblasts adhesion and to greatly reduce staphyloccous epidermidis adhesion to the implant surface 36 . \n the impact of slime dispersants and anti - adhesives on in vitro biofilm formation on iols was further investigated by kadry and co - workers 37 , using a staphyloccous epidermidis wild strain , isolated from a patient with endophtalmitis ; the authors reported the ability of hyaluronan to reduce bacterial adhesion to iols to 30% , compared with untreated control cells . \n the authors suggested the use of adjuvant therapy such as dispersants or anti - adhesives , in addition to the antibiotics in irrigating solutions for bacterial ocular infections . \n more recently , the in vitro antiadhesive and antibiofilm activity of hyaluronic acid towards bacterial species commonly isolated from respiratory infections was investigated by drago et al . \n 33 . in this study , the interference exerted on bacterial adhesion was evaluated by using hep-2 cells , while the antibiofilm activity was assessed by means of spectrophotometry after incubation of biofilm with hyaluronic acid and staining with crystal violet . \n the experimental findings clearly demonstrated how hyaluronic acid is able to interfere with bacterial adhesion to a cellular substrate in a concentration - dependent manner . \n moreover , staphylococcus aureus biofilm was found to be more sensitive to the action of ha , compared to that produced by haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis . concerning more specifically the antimicrobial activity , ha \n has also been shown to exert varied bacteriostatic , but not bactericidal , dose - dependent effects on different microorganisms in the planktonic phase 31 , 38 . in this \n regard , radaeva et al . reported the inhibiting activity of ha with respect to some pseudomonas species 39 , while ardizzoni and co - workers 30 investigated the effects of ha on 15 atcc bacterial strains , representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species . \n their results showed that different microbial species and , sometimes , different strains belonging to the same species , are differently affected by ha . in particular , staphylococci , enterococci , streptococcus mutans , two escherichia coli strains , pseudomonas aeruginosa , candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose - dependent growth inhibition , while no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans and s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose . comparing the potential bacteriostatic effect of some of the most commonly used biomatrix materials ( collagen type i , hyaluronic acid , hydroxyapatite , polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid ) on the growth over the first 12h of exposure of some of the most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens ( staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus epidermidis , -hemolytic streptococcus , pseudomonas aeruginosa ) , carlson and co - workers 38 found that ha had the most significant bacteriostatic properties on the studied organisms . \n 31 investigated the potential bacteriostatic effect of hyaluronic acid in different concentrations and molecular weight on oral and non - oral microorganisms ( staphylococcus aureus , propionibacterium acnes , actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , pavotella oris and porphyromonas gingivalis ) with potential application in dentistry surgery ; the results showed that different hyaluronan solutions exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains . \n the authors concluded that the clinical application of hyaluronan in form of membranes , gels , or sponges during surgical therapy may reduce bacterial contamination of the surgical wound , thereby lessening the risk of postsurgical infection and promoting more predictable regeneration . \n concerning possible orthopaedic applications , in 2004 harris and richards 40 showed the visualization and quantification of s. aureus adhering to a variety of different treated / coated titanium surfaces . in their study , \n coating titanium with sodium hyaluronate significantly decreased the density of s. aureus adhering to the surfaces and its potential use in osteosynthesis , orthopaedics or dental applications was suggested out . in a very recent review on polysaccharide - based coatings , that have been proposed over the last ten years to impede biofilm formation on material surfaces exposed to bacterial contamination , \n hyaluronic acid was discussed as one of the most studied , with demonstrated non - fouling properties on glass surfaces 41 ; displaying hydrophilic characteristics ( contact angle of 22 ) , this coating was in fact reported to reduce adhesion of s. epidermidis and e. coli by several orders of magnitude compared to the unmodified glass slide . \n similarly , adhesion of s. aureus on ti foils functionalized with hyaluronic acid - catechol was lower than on pristine substrates . \n based on ha antiadhesive properties , a novel ha - based hydrogel has been recently proposed , in order to protect implanted biomaterials in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery from bacterial colonization 42 ; this fast - resorbable hydrogel coating , composed of covalently linked hyaluronan and poly - d , l - lactide (  defensive antibacterial coating  , dac , novagenit srl , mezzolombardo , italy ) , has been found to have a synergistic antibiofilm activity with various antibacterials and able to be effectively manually spread onto the surface of various biomaterials commonly used in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery 43 ( fig . \n 1 ) . the ability to completely cover even sand - blasted titanium surface and resist scraping has in fact been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) analysis ( cf . \n this is an important requirement in order to reduce the exposed surface of a biomaterial , thus creating a uniform coating of the surface and leaving no pores or cracks that could eventually be colonized by planktonic bacteria . in unpublished experiments ( novagenit srl , data on file ) , in order to evaluate dac ability to prevent bacterial adhesion , 200 mg of hydrogel were homogenously spread on the surface of sterile titanium discs . \n hydrogel - coated substrates and uncoated substrates ( controls ) were then placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells for 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes . \n the remaining adhered cells were detached by adding a solution of 0.1% w / v dithiothreitol ( dtt ) ( sigma - aldrich , milan , italy ) to each well and stirring for 15 minutes at room temperature . \n then , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tryptic soy agar ( tsa ; merck , darmstadt , germany ) and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts . \n the results showed that the adhesion density of s. aureus on titanium discs pre - treated with dac , was significantly lower than adhesion on untreated controls at each time point ( fig . \n 2 ) . in particular , reductions of adhered bacteria equal to 86.8% , 80.4% , \n 74.6% and 66.7% vs untreated discs were observed after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of incubation , respectively , while an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and pre - treated discs ( fig . \n further analyses were conducted to show the ability to dislodge previously adhered bacteria ; to this aim , titanium discs were placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells in order to allow the adhesion of bacterial cells . \n afterwards , 200 mg of hydrogel were spread on the surface of contaminated titanium discs in order to remove previously adhered bacteria . \n non - adherent bacteria were removed by rinsing with sterile saline , while the remaining adhered cells were detached by adding 0.1% dtt as previously described . \n then , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tsa and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts . \n the results showed that dac hydrogel treatment of discs reduced the amount of adhered bacteria in respect to control discs after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of 84.0% , 72.8% , 72.3% and 64.3% , respectively ( fig.4 ) . \n once again , an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and treated discs ( fig . \n dac hydrogel showed similar or superior in vitro activity , compared to various antibacterials and a synergistic activity when used in combination ( fig . \n were grown on chrome - cobalt devices in 6-wells polystyrene plates containing tsb for 24 hours at 37c . \n then , growth medium was removed together with non - adherent bacteria and new broth added . \n the plates were incubated at 37c in ambient air , until a visible biofilm was obtained . \n gentamycin and vancomycin were tested at a final concentration of 20 mg / ml . similarly , when mixed with the hydrogel , 60 mg of gel powder were reconstituted with 1 ml of water for injections containing gentamicin or vancomycin at 20 mg / ml concentration . \n amount of biofilm at each time was determined before hydrogel and antibiotic agents addition and after 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 and 48 hours of incubation by a spectrophotometric assay . \n in particular , at each time , broth was removed and biofilm stained with crystal violet . \n after elution of the stain from implants with absolute ethanol , the amount of biofilm was quantified by reading optical density ( o.d . ) at a wavelength of 595 nm against blank ( consisting of ethanol ) . \n amount of biofilm at each time was compared with that formed on the same type of implant before treatment . \n each assay was performed in duplicate and repeated for three times . at each time point , both for gentamycin and vancomycin showed only a partial inhibition of biofilm formation ( ca . \n 40 - 50% for vancomycin ) , with minor difference between the two studied microorganisms . on the other side , \n 50% in comparison to the untreated controls , while a combination of the hydrogel with either antibacterial resulted in a larger reduction of biofilm formation ( approximately 75 to 80% in comparison with untreated controls ) . \n both these experimental studies show the ability of the dac hydrogel to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of common bacterial pathogens , thus potentially providing an effective protection of the implant ; however , these data also point out how , in the clinical setting , in the absence of an adequate immune response from the host and/or of sufficient local levels of antibiotics , a passive antiadhesive coating 18 like ha can be overcome by the remaining bacteria in a time - dependent manner . \n for this reason , any passive antiadhesive coating of implants 44 should probably better be seen as a tool to reduce and delay bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation to a variable degree , also depending on the local environment , the contaminating bacterial species and initial bacterial load ; this may still provide an additional advantage to the host 's cells to first colonize the implanted biomaterial and win the competition with the microorganisms that may eventually be present , thus contributing to reduce the occurrence of implant - related infections . \n several clinical local applications of ha to reduce the impact of biofilm - related infections have been reported , in different clinical settings , with favourable results and no adverse events . \n 45 recently described topical administration of hyaluronic acid in children with recurrent or chronic middle ear inflammations and chronic adenoiditis . in this prospective , single - blind , randomised controlled study , otoscopy , tympanometry and pure - tone audiometry in children which received the daily topical administration of normal 0.9% sodium chloride saline solution ( control group ) or 9 mg of sodium hyaluronate in 3 ml of a 0.9% sodium saline solution was performed . \n the final analysis was based on 116 children ( 49.1% boys ; mean age , 62.9  17.9 months ) : 58 in the control group and 58 in the study group . at the end of follow - up , \n the prevalence of patients with impaired otoscopy was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.024 ) compared to baseline but not in the control group . in comparison with baseline , \n the prevalence of patients with impaired tympanometry at the end of the follow - up period was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.047 ) but not in the control group . \n the reduction in the prevalence of patients with conductive hearing loss ( chl ) ( p value = 0.008 ) and those with moderate chl ( p value = 0.048 ) was significant in the study group , but not in the control group . \n the mean auditory threshold had also significantly improved by the end of treatment in the study group ( p value = 0.004 ) but not in the control group . \n several studies have also reported the beneficial effect of topical ha in chronic urinary tract infections ( uti ) . \n in contrast to traditional antibiotic therapy , which aims at eradicating pathogens , treatment with ha targets bacterial adherence to the bladder mucosa with the presumption that a damaged glycosaminoglycan mucous layer facilitates bacterial adherence and therefore recurrent uti 46 . among others 47 , 48 , \n lipovac and colleagues evaluated the efficacy of nine ha bladder instillations over 6 months in 20 women with a history of recurrent uti . \n their status was assessed prospectively but compared with a retrospective review of patients ' charts . \n the number of infections per year per patient was significantly reduced ( from 4.990.92 to 0.560.82 , p>0.001 ) and the mean time to recurrence ( from 76.724.6 to 178.325.5 days , p>0.001 ) was prolonged significantly . \n nevertheless 65% of treated patients were free of recurrences until the end of study ( 47.6 weeks ) 49 . \n were able to provide a higher level of evidence by reporting a prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , in which a significant reduction of 77% ( p<0.0002 ) in the uti rate per patient per year versus placebo was observed at the end of the study . \n moreover , mean time to uti recurrence was significantly prolonged ( 185.278.7 versus 52.733.4 days , p<0.001 ) after treatment compared with placebo . \n overall urinary symptoms and quality of life measured by questionnaires significantly improved compared with placebo 50 . \n very recently a multicentre european study confirmed the efficacy of intravesical administration of combined hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate ( cs ) for the treatment of female recurrent urinary tract infections 51 . \n a total of 276 adult women received intravesical administration of ha+cs or standard of care ( antimicrobial/ immunoactive prophylaxis/ probiotics / cranberry ) . at follow - up , \n 181 patients treated with ha+cs and 95 patients treated with standard of care from 7 centres were available . \n the crude and adjusted ors ( 95% ci ) for bacteriologically confirmed recurrence within 12 months were 0.77 ( 0.46 to 1.28 ) and 0.51 ( 0.27 to 0.96 ) , respectively . \n studies were also undertaken to determine the effect on clinical variables , sub - gingival bacteria and local immune response brought about by application of hyaluronan - containing gels in early wound healing after scaling and root planing ( srp ) in dentistry 52 , 53 . in the study reported from eick et al . \n the exclusion criteria were : antibiotics intake in the 6 months before the study , periodontal treatment received during the previous year , pregnancy , nursing , smoking , chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis , and allergy to ingredients in the drug . in the test group ( n=17 ) , a 0.8% hyaluronan - containing gels ( ha ) was introduced into all periodontal pockets during srp and a 0.2% ha gel was applied by the patients onto the gingival margin twice daily during the following 2 weeks while the control group ( n=17 ) was treated with srp only ; no placebo was used . probing depth ( pd ) and clinical attachment level ( cal ) \n were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months , and subgingival plaque and sulcus fluid samples were taken for microbiologic and biochemical analysis . in both groups , pd and cal \n the changes in pd and the reduction of the number of pockets with pd5 mm were significantly higher in the test group after 3 ( p=0.014 and 0.021 ) and 6 ( p=0.046 and 0.045 ) months . \n six months after srp , the counts of treponema denticola were significantly reduced in both groups ( both p=0.043 ) , as were those of campylobacter rectus in the test group only ( p=0.028 ) . \n although to date no surface modification has been reported to be able to fully prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 55 , available data show that hyaluronic acid has a proven in vitro antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect against some of the most common pathogens and it has been used safely , alone or in combination with other polymers , with satisfactory results in different conditions associated with biofilm - related chronic infections . \n clinical data in various applications , including dentistry , urology , wound management , dermatology and orthopedics , allow to consider the potential use of ha as a protective coating barrier of implants particularly safe and feasible on a large scale basis . \n while antibacterial coatings to mitigate the occurrence of implant- and biofilm - related infections are regarded as one of the most needed technology , currently only few and insufficient options are available for clinical use in orthopedics and trauma surgery 18 . \n considering the pathogenesis of implant - related infections , any protection offered by a fully biocompatible antiadhesive barrier , like ha and some of its derivatives , could be extremely useful to reduce the tremendous burden of implant - related infections . \n on the other hand , it should be noted that hyaluronic acid as a passive protective barrier has some limits . among others , \n the antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect is limited and may vary , depending on the type of the microorganism , the bacterial load , the local environment , etc . \n ; moreover , ha protection may be neutralized by the possible ability of some bacteria to produce hyaluronidase , an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of hyaluronic acid 56 , while collagen and hyaluronan may even become possible ligands for microbial attachment in particular situations 57 , 58 . \n to overcome at least some of these limits , possible loading of hyaluronic - based hydrogels with antibiotics is technically feasible and has been proposed by different authors 59 - 62 , being a possible option for future developments and large scale clinical applications , provided that regulatory requirements can be met .",
         "living in biofilms is probably the most common condition for bacteria and fungi and biofilm - related infections account for the majority of bacterial infectious diseases worldwide.among others biofilm - related infections , those associated with implanted biomaterials have an enormous and still largely underestimated impact in orthopaedics and trauma , cardio - surgery and several other surgical disciplines.given the limited efficacy of existing antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of bacterial biofilms , new strategies are needed to protect implants and host tissues , overcoming the striking ability of the microorganisms to adhere on different surfaces and to immediately protect themselves by forming the biofilm matrix.adhesion is a necessary first step in microbial colonization and pathogenesis and provides a potential target for new preventive and treatment approach.among various polymers , tested as antibacterial coatings , hyaluronic acid and some of its composites do offer a well - established long - term safety profile and a proven ability to reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.aim of the present review is to summarize the available evidence concerning the antiadhesion / antibiofilm activity of hyaluronic acid and some of its derivatives to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in various experimental and clinical settings .",

         "in 2011 , who declared  combat drug resistance : no action today , no cure tomorrow .  . in recent years \n presently , antimicrobial resistance ( amr ) poses a major threat to patient 's treatment as it leads to increased morbidity and mortality , increased hospital stay , and severe economic loss to the patient and nation [ 3 , 4 ] . \n the clinical isolates such as pseudomonas aeruginosa , methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , enterococci especially vancomycin resistant enterococci ( vre ) , and members of family enterobacteriaceae , for example , klebsiella pneumoniae , e. coli , and proteus sp . \n in the last two decades , there were so much increase of infectious diseases that the standard of public health in many parts of the world is equivalent to preantibiotic era . \n as per standardized international terminology created by european centre for disease control ( ecdc ) and centre for disease control & prevention ( cdc ) , atlanta , the multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) , extensively drug - resistant ( xdr ) , and pandrug - resistant ( pdr ) bacteria have been well defined . \n multidrug resistant ( mdr ) was defined as acquired nonsusceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories . extensively drug \n resistant ( xdr ) was defined as nonsusceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories ( i.e. , bacterial isolates remain susceptible to only one or two antimicrobial categories ) . \n pandrug resistant ( pdr ) was defined as nonsusceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories . \n hence , this short term study was undertaken to detect the incidence of mdr , xdr , and pdr bacterial isolates in a tertiary care hospital of central india . \n this short term cross - sectional study was conducted in the department of microbiology from 15th of april to 15th of july , 2014 . \n the bacterial strains were isolated from different clinical samples and were identified by conventional methods . \n the clinical specimens from indoor patient departments ( ipd ) only were included in the study . \n antibiotic susceptibility test of bacterial strains was done by kirby bauer disc diffusion method   as per clinical laboratory standard institute ( clsi ) guidelines . \n antibiotics used for gram positive cocci ( gpc ) were penicillin , erythromycin , ciprofloxacin , tetracycline , amikacin , vancomycin , and linezolid and for gram negative bacilli ( gnb ) were amikacin , ceftazidime , ceftazidime -

mdr strains isolated , \n the commonest mdr strains were detected from e. coli 79/250 ( 31.6% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 75/250 ( 30% ) . \n similarly , out of 90 gnb - xdr strains isolated , the commonest xdr strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa 29/90 ( 32.2% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 25/90 ( 27.8% ) . in the present study , 137 ( 18.4% ) \n others include wards like dermatology , pulmonary medicine , orthopedics , and cardiovascular and thoracic surgery ( cvts ) . \n the different icus include neonatal icu ( nicu ) , medicine icu ( micu ) , operation theatre icu ( ot icu ) , and paediatric icu ( picu ) . \n out of total 393 mdr strains detected , 127 ( 32.3% ) ( the highest number ) mdr strains were isolated from surgery wards followed by 72 ( 18.3% ) mdr strains from different icus . \n amongst total 146 xdr strains isolated , 41 ( 28.1% ) ( the highest number ) were isolated from surgery wards also . \n out of 72 mdr strains detected from different icus , 29 ( 40.3% ) ( the highest number ) mdr strains were isolated from nicu , followed by 20 ( 27.8% ) and 18 ( 25% ) from ot icu , and only 5 ( 6.9% ) from picu . even in the total 26 xdr strains isolated from different icus , 10 ( 38.5% ) ( the highest number ) \n the percentage of mdr and xdr strains isolated from different icus was 72/138 ( 52.2% ) and 26/138 ( 18.8% ) , respectively , which were again much more than mdr and xdr strains isolated from wards 321/742 ( 43.3% ) and 120/742 ( 16.2% ) , respectively . \n 275 patients were admitted to nicu , of whom 29 ( 10.5% ) were positive for mdr strains and 10 ( 3.6% ) were positive for xdr strains . out of total 1907 \n patients admitted to surgery ward , 127 ( 6.7% ) were positive for mdr strains whereas 41 ( 2.1% ) were positive for xdr strains . in micu , \n 545 patients were admitted and 20 ( 3.7% ) were positive for mdr strains and 8 ( 1.5% ) were positive for xdr strains . \n the clinical and financial burden to patients and health care providers for mdros is really challenging . \n barbara soule , joint commission resources practice leader , infection prevention and control services , has told , \n patients who are infected with mdros often have an increased risk of prolonged illness and mortality . \n the cost of care for these patients can be more than double as compared to those without mdro infection  . since the year 2000 , only 4 new classes of antibiotics have been approved by food and drug administration ( fda ) , us , for example , linezolid , streptogramins , daptomycin , and tigecycline . \n the problem is that the bacteria are developing resistance at a much faster pace than the new drug development . regarding public health attention , mdros are described as superbugs having very limited treatment options . for some mdros \n , only 1 or 2 antibiotics can be effective with toxic side effects . in 2009 , boucher et al . \n have reported eskape organisms as  bad bugs ,  where e stands for enterococcus faecium , s for staphylococcus aureus , k for klebsiella pneumoniae , a for acinetobacter baumannii , p for pseudomonas aeruginosa , and e for enterobacter species . in the year 2009 only \n , peterson has reported the escape group of organism , which was the same as the above list but k was replaced by c , that is , clostridium difficile , and the last e stands for enterobacteriaceae . in the present study , amongst 250 gnb - mdr strains isolated , the commonest mdr strains were detected from e. coli 79/250 ( 31.6% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 75/250 ( 30% ) . \n similarly , out of 90 gnb - xdr strains isolated , the commonest xdr strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa 29/90 ( 32.2% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 25/90 ( 27.8% ) . \n aly and balkhy reported that most prevalent mdro in their study was e. coli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae . in another study , carried out in a tertiary care hospital in riyadh \n , it has been reported that most frequent mdr pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by e. coli . \n the percentage of mdr e. coli strains was more than klebsiella pneumoniae and even pseudomonas aeruginosa in our study probably because a total number of e. coli strains isolated ( 261 ) were also higher . \n the slightly increased incidence of drug resistant strains observed in our study may be because our hospital is a tertiary care center in a rural setup and patients from adjoining districts and even villages are admitted for treatment . before attending the hospital , most of the patients get different antibiotics from general practitioners or due to over - the - counter sell of antibiotics often in improper dose . \n the limitation of this study is that this is a single center study for only three - month period in a tertiary care hospital in central india . to reflect the trend of infections caused by mdr and xdr strains of bacteria in the region , a multicenter study involving all types of healthcare setups for a minimum period of one year \n there is paucity of data regarding mdros in health care setup not only in india but also worldwide . \n unless and until multidrug resistant organisms are detected and their incidence is known , the strategies for their control can not be adopted properly in healthcare setup . hence , detection , prevention of transmission of mdros by following infection control practices , antimicrobial surveillance , and stewardship are need of the hour . \n misuse and overuse of antibiotics , over - the - counter selling of antibiotics without prescription to common people , must be stopped by strict implementations of rules and regulations . \n we hereby conclude that early detection and close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr bacterial strains must be started by all clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance which is now a global problem .",
         "background and objective . \n antimicrobial resistance is now a major challenge to clinicians for treating patients . \n hence , this short term study was undertaken to detect the incidence of multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) , extensively drug - resistant ( xdr ) , and pandrug - resistant ( pdr ) bacterial isolates in a tertiary care hospital . \n material and methods . \n the clinical samples were cultured and bacterial strains were identified in the department of microbiology . \n the antibiotic susceptibility profile of different bacterial isolates was studied to detect mdr , xdr , and pdr bacteria . \n results . the antibiotic susceptibility profile of 1060 bacterial strains was studied . \n 393 ( 37.1% ) bacterial strains were mdr , 146 ( 13.8% ) strains were xdr , and no pdr was isolated . \n all ( 100% ) gram negative bacterial strains were sensitive to colistin whereas all ( 100% ) gram positive bacterial strains were sensitive to vancomycin . \n conclusion . \n close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr must be done by all clinical microbiology laboratories to implement effective measures to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance .",

         "ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder . \n the abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection ( uti ) , which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney . \n this abnormality can be suspected in the fetus by antenatal ultrasonography ( usg ) and confirmed by other x - ray investigations after birth . \n the incidence of ureterocele is variable with the highest rate of 1:500 and it is generally found in females with duplex system association ( 95% ) . \n ureteroceles can have different clinical presentations , such as antenatal hydronephrosis , uti , vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) , bladder outlet obstruction , prolapsed urethral mass , etc . \n usg and voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) are essential initial procedures for a child suspected of having a ureteral anomaly . \n a 5-year - old female child was referred to our department for tc - diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ( dtpa ) scan . \n she was a follow - up case of right - sided hydroureteronephrosis with pyonephrosis with percutaneous tube ( pcn ) insertion done on the right side . \n patient 's blood urea and serum creatinine were 29 and 1.3 mg / dl , respectively . \n usg of the abdomen revealed left - sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and gross enlargement of the right kidney , reaching up to lower abdomen with dilated pelvis and ureter . \n the child was referred for evaluation of glomerular filtration rate and excretory function of kidneys . \n tc - dtpa scan was done in our department with right pcn tube in situ . \n pcn tube was clamped during the acquisition of dynamic and prevoid static image and clamp released thereafter . on tc - dtpa scan , left kidney showed good perfusion and adequate cortical radiotracer concentration followed by good drainage into dilated ureter . \n right ureter and right pelvicalyceal system ( pcs ) were visualized in the postvoid image ( indirect evidence of vur ) [ figure 2b , thin arrow ] . \n retention of radiotracer was noted in dilated pcs and dilated ureter in delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2c and d ] . \n faint visualization of radiotracer was noted through the pcn tube after removal of clamp [ figure 2b , bold arrow ] . \n a large photopenia was noted in the suprapubic region in the urinary bladder ( ub ) during dynamic [ figure 1 ] as well as delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2a  d ] . \n an usg of the abdomen was done in the radiology department of our hospital to find out the cause of this persistent photopenia in the ub . \n usg of the abdomen showed evidence of left -

dimercapto succinic acid ( dmsa ) scan should be undertaken routinely to assess the distribution of function in the duplex kidney and for detecting and follow - up of scarred tissue and nonfunctioning upper poles in cases of ureterocele . \n did a study on pediatric ureteroceles in 19 patients , on the diagnosis , management and treatment options . \n vcug was able to detect vur in 13 out of 17 patients ( 33% ) . \n dmsa scintigraphy showed ipsilateral renal scarring and nonfunctioning upper pole images in 7 out of 13 patients . computed tomography and mag3 scintigraphy \n did a study on the management of 36 patients with varied presentation of complicated ureteroceles . \n usg , micturating cystourethrogram , isotope renogram were done preoperatively in all the babies . in one of the cases , \n initial usg was unable to detect ureterocele in most of the cases in this study . \n they said that unless the usg is done in well - hydrated , cooperative patient , ureterocele is likely to be missed on usg . \n hence , an intravenous pyelogram , radioisotope renogram , and micturating cystourethrogram are invaluable in the complete understanding of ureterocele . in our patient also , the diagnosis of ureterocele was missed on initial usg . \n photopenia was noted in the ub on our scan , and this prompted us to investigate the patient further . \n possible causes for photopenic defects in the ub on nuclear scintigraphic studies include bladder papilloma , bladder polyp , carcinoma bladder , bladder calculus , foreign body in ub , intravesical ureterocele , etc . \n repeat usg revealed the cause of photopenia in ub in our case to be an intravesical ureterocele . on reviewing the literature we found that tc -

         "the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality . \n dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation \n . however , the needs for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable . in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ] . \n inadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate . in our institution , the only sampling tool available to perform the outpatient sampling procedure is the uterine explora model i - mx120 ( http://www.coopersurgical.com/ ) ( figure 1 ) . \n in addition , the device is sterile and disposable ( one - time use ) . \n the advantages of using explora rather than d&c as a sampling device include a reduction in hospitalization costs , extra convenience for the patient and physician , and the minimal complications of the procedure . \n the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses . \n after obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) . \n two hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model \n i , the syringe provided with the instrument was used to create a negative pressure , and the explora was rotated as it was withdrawn . after withdrawal , the tip was cut off , and the tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin saline fixative and was sent for pathological examination . \n the pathologists who interpreted the endometrial samples were blinded to the instrument or method used to obtain the samples . \n an inadequate sample was defined as consisting of only blood , cervical mucus , endocervical epithelium , or blood with fragments of endometrial glands or stroma insufficient for histopathological assessment and diagnosis . \n the age , gravidity , parity , menstrual history , uterine size , hysteroscopy findings ( when available ) , and the presence or absence of any cervical abnormality were recorded on the request forms , which were reviewed by the investigators . for each of the two methods used ( explora model i and d&c ) , the numbers and percentages of inadequate samples and age group clustering were calculated and statistically analyzed . \n of the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples , \n the explora sampler was used to collect 224 samples ( 88.5% ) , whereas 29 samples ( 11.5% ) were obtained by d&c ( figure 2 ) . \n thus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 ) \n . age group clustering ( i.e. , numbers of premenopausal and postmenopausal women ) of inadequate sample results was also calculated ( figure 3 ) . of the 253 inadequate samples , \n 82.6% were from women 45 years of age and older ( i.e. , postmenopausal ) compared to 17.4% in premenopausal women ; the age difference was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . \n the detection rates of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using both methods were assessed and calculated . \n of the 73 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia , 50 ( 68.5% ) were diagnosed by d&c , and 23 ( 31.5% ) were diagnosed using the explora sampler . \n however , of the 18 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer , the rates of detection were similar between the two methods . \n endometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ] . in recent years \n , less hazardous and more inexpensive and convenient outpatient sampling methods have replaced the traditional , in - hospital , endometrial curettage . \n the advantages of outpatient endometrial biopsy include reduced cost and less risk for the patient , as no anesthesia is required . \n furthermore , the discomfort and pain produced by sampling have been reported to be minimal . \n however , it is essential to ensure that outpatient endometrial sampling is quantitatively adequate and comparably accurate to conventional dilatation and curettage . \n a sample is judged as adequate if a specific diagnosis can be given from the histological examination of the endometrial fragments obtained . \n adequacy can be measured by comparison of either outpatient biopsy with curettage histological evaluation or outpatient biopsy with the results of pathological examination of hysterectomy specimens [ 3 , 4 ] . \n many techniques for obtaining an endometrial sample without the need for curettage have been described in the literature . \n chicago , il , usa ) and the novak biopsy curette with a 10  ml syringe functioning as an aspiratory device , which have been shown to be equally effective compared to d&c in detecting an endometrial pathology [ 69 ] . \n however , the vabra aspirator and novak biopsy curette , although widely available and relatively inexpensive , have several disadvantages , including the need for an electric vacuum pump to perform the aspiration in the former technique and the pain caused by both methods . as a result of these drawbacks , smaller inexpensive and \n self - contained instruments have been developed and the prototype of this class of endometrial samplers is the pipelle . the pipelle has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of vabra aspiration and the novak curettage while causing less pain [ 911 ] . \n all of these instruments ( i.e. , the vabra aspirator , the novak biopsy curette , and the pipelle ) have low rates of false - negative and insufficient tissue results for the detection of endometrial abnormalities , as determined by comparison to hysterectomy specimens [ 1113 ] . \n it was found that pipelle biopsy had a sensitivity of 99.2% in pinpointing high grade cancer and a sensitivity of 93% in detecting low grade malignancies ; the sensitivities defined for d&c were 100% and 97% , respectively . while \n excellent agreement  was generally noted between preoperative histology and grade and the final pathology , pre - operative endometrial sampling more commonly provided underestimates of final grade ( low grade versus high grade ) than overestimates . \n the explora is somewhat similar in its design to the pipelle , but clinical studies on its effectiveness are scarce , with the effectiveness ranging between 14.6 and 15% according to various studies [ 6 , 15 ] . \n our own findings revealed that the rate of obtaining inadequate samples using the explora was much higher ( 17.6% ) than the rates reported in the literature . \n however , most of these cases ( 82.6% ) were obtained from postmenopausal women with atrophic endometrial status . \n this finding is in keeping with the rates reported by other investigators [ 58 , 16 ] . \n this retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique . \n this finding indicates that clinicians performing endometrial sampling would benefit from more experience and training using the explora technique . \n additional studies comparing the adequacy of samples obtained with different endometrial sampling techniques and devices are warranted . \n furthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma .",
         "aims . our aim is to compare the adequacy and diagnostic yield of samples obtained by the endometrial explora sampler i - mx120 with endometrial specimens obtained by conventional dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) \n . methods . a total of 1270 endometrial samples \n were received in the histopathology laboratories at the king khalid university hospital , riyadh , saudi arabia , between 2007 and 2010 . in the outpatient clinic , \n the uterine explora model i was used to obtain 996 samples . \n the remaining 274 samples were obtained by conventional d&c . \n sample adequacy and the clustering of inadequate specimens according to age groups by the two different techniques were compared and statistically analyzed . results . out of 1270 endometrial samples , 253 ( 19.9% ) were inadequate . \n the uterine explora was used in 88.5% of these inadequate samples ( 253 samples ) , and the remaining 11.5% were obtained by d&c . \n the insufficient tissue incidence was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with the d&c ( 2.2% ) and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . \n the ages of the patients , as well as the clinical indications for the procedures , were recorded . conclusion . \n this retrospective study demonstrated better specimen adequacy when d&c was used compared to the higher rate of sample insufficiency obtained with the explora .",

         "with increasing availability , widened indications , and technical refinements of computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , the number of incidentally discovered adrenal lesions , such as adrenal incidentalomas and incidental adrenal enlargement , is increasing . in a recent study by tang et al . \n , among a total of 564 eligible ct studies ( patients undergoing ct without prior known malignancy , trauma , or endocrine disease ) , adrenal hyperplasia was detected in 64 cases , giving a prevalence of 11.3% . \n this indicated that incidental adrenal enlargement had a significant prevalence and has become a common clinical problem . \n it should be emphasized that the term incidental adrenal enlargement represents the way the lesion was detected ( incidentally ) , rather than the etiology or diagnosis . \n it is a common term for a variety of adrenal disorders , but its cause must be properly assessed so that patients needing treatment , such as those with hormone hypersecretion or malignant disease , can receive appropriate care . however , there is a lack of literature on functional status and its follow - up to provide comprehensive insight to these findings . \n patients with incidental adrenal enlargement were evaluated in a tertiary referral hospital with endocrinological departments in china . \n this study aimed to determine the primary clinical presentation that most frequently leads to the discovery of adrenal enlargement , to evaluate clinical characteristics and functional status of these patients , and to analyze risk factors for functional lesions . \n this retrospective study included 578 patients with adrenal imaging features showing adrenal enlargement who were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology in pla general hospital ( beijing , china ) between january 1993 and july 2013 . \n data retrieved included patient demographics , final functional diagnosis , adrenal imaging features , and concomitant diseases . \n patients were classified as having incidental adrenal enlargement when abdominal imaging was performed for indications unrelated to adrenal disease . \n patients with diseases known to cause adrenal enlargement , such as known endocrine disorders which could affect adrenal size , trauma , and underlying malignancy , were excluded . among all enrolled patients , 78 presented with incidental adrenal enlargement . \n the ct imaging technique used was not standardized due to the various clinical indications . however , to be included in their entirety on a maximum of 5  mm section thickness , the upper limit of normal was set as 10  mm for the body of the gland and 5  mm for each limb as documented by vincent et al . . \n the type of enlargement , based on subjective evaluation of the adrenal glands , was recorded as either smooth or nodular . \n nodular enlargement was diagnosed if the adrenal gland had an irregular contour , contained nodules , and had normal adrenal tissue interspersed between the nodules . \n smooth enlargement was defined as enlargement of the gland with a smooth contour and no measureable or diffuse nodules . after obtaining patient history and physical examination , all patients underwent biochemical evaluation to assess their functional status . \n patients with elevated 24-hour urine - free cortisol level ( 2 times ) or those in whom plasma cortisol levels did not decrease after an overnight low - dose dexamethasone test ( 1  mg dst ; cutoff 50 \n patients with an aldosterone - rennin ratio ( arr ) > 20 underwent any 1 of 3 confirmatory tests ( saline infusion , captopril challenge , or postural stimulation ) to confirm or exclude definitively primary hyperaldosteronism ( pa ) . \n categorical data such as gender and clinical / radiologic features were compared using -test or fisher 's exact test . \n variables that resulted in a p < 0.05 in the univariate analyses were entered into logistic regression analysis to assess the risk factors of functional lesions . \n the hospital ethics committee approved this study , and written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents . \n of 578 patients with adrenal enlargement , 78 cases ( 13.49% ) were detected incidentally . \n every 2 years , the numbers of total cases were 17 , 11 , 14 , 24 , 33 , 31 , 54 , 55 , 114 , and 225 , respectively . \n the numbers of incidental adrenal enlargement cases were 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 4 , 16 , and 49 , respectively . \n in addition , the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement gradually increased ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 4.17% , 3.03% , 7.32% , 9.26% , 7.27% , 14.04% , and 21.33% ) . \n 39 cases had unilateral enlargement on the left side and 3 on the right side , and the remaining 36 were bilateral enlargement . \n as shown in table 1 , routine medical checkup was found to have the greatest chance ( 43.59% ) of revealing clinical onsets leading to the discovery of adrenal enlargement . \n predominant complaints included low back pain ( 10.26% ) and abdominal pain ( 3.85% ) . in addition , there were 30 ( 38.46% ) cases in which the lesions were incidentally detected during hospitalization for underlying diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and coronary heart disease , among others . biochemical and functional evaluation revealed that 54 ( 69.23% ) cases were nonfunctional and 12 ( 15.38% ) were subclinical cushing syndrome ( scs ) ; among these patients , 10 cases were diagnosed as aimah , the other 2 were diagnosed as adenomas , and they were all confirmed by pathology results . \n primary hyperaldosteronism 6 ( 7.69% ) , metastatic 1 ( 1.28% ) , the primary cancer was gastric cancer . \n there were 5 patients ( 6.41% ) whose functional status remained unclear because of failure to finish the functional evaluation ( figure 2 ) . \n nodular adrenal enlargement ( or 7.306 ; 95% ci , 1.72728.667 ; p = 0.006 ) was the risk factor for functional lesions . \n as outlined above , incidental adrenal enlargement is detected with increasing frequency , most likely due to widespread increase in cross - sectional imaging , and is gradually emerging as a common clinical problem . \n our study shows that the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement has gradually increased by year . \n mean age at diagnosis was 50.32 years , which is in line with other incidentally detected adrenal findings , namely , adrenal incidentaloma . \n the increasing age of the general population and a research trend towards more advanced investigations in the elderly population may be contributing to the high detection rate in this age group . \n our results indicate that , for the elderly patients , it is essential to place emphasis on these incidental findings . \n 's study   indicated that , of the total 64 patients , of which 40 ( 63% ) were men and 24 ( 37% ) were women , 43 ( 67% ) cases were bilateral enlargement and 21 ( 33% ) cases were unilateral . \n in addition , smooth enlargement was more common , in 53 ( 83% ) cases , and together these statistics reflect the likelihood that adrenal enlargement will be bilateral , smooth , and found in men . \n however , our study did not show this tendency , likely because the research goals and thus , study populations , differed between the 2 studies . \n 's study aimed to explore prevalence , while the present study aimed to evaluate functional status . \n in addition , patients enrolled in our study were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology . it should be noted that admitting was more or less selective , especially in tertiary referral hospitals , and that economic considerations in parts of china were still a problem . \n clinically , upon discovery of incidental adrenal enlargement , 2 issues arise : functionality and malignancy . in the relevant literature [ 48 ] , adrenal enlargement can result from endocrine disorders , such as adrenocorticotropic hormone- ( acth- ) dependent or independent cushing syndrome , pa , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men-1 ) , and congenital adrenal hyperplasia . \n other potential causes include nonfunctional lesions , defined as a radiographic adrenal enlargement without clinical or biochemical manifestations , inflammation , neoplastic processes , obesity , or depression . \n 12 patients were found to have subclinical cushing syndrome ( originated from the adrenal gland ) and 6 patients were diagnosed with pa . however , the variety of disease spectrum in the study was only moderate , perhaps due , in part , to the limited number of included cases . \n it is important to note that even though reported prevalence was up to 11.3% , patient referrals to endocrinologists are relatively rare . \n this is likely related to the poor radiological awareness of this issue and its potential clinical significance . \n the clinical significance of lesion location and patient gender is smaller . in the present study , \n acth - independent macronodular hyperplasia ( aimah ) and primary pigmented nodular adrenal hyperplasia often manifest as adrenal hyperplasia . the clinical features of aimah tended to be atypical . \n nodules usually distorted and completely obscured the normal adrenal glands and were characteristically  ginger - like  . \n as for pa , adrenal glands affected by idiopathic hyperaldosteronism ( iha ) may be normal on the ct scan or show nodular changes , and small aldosterone producing adenoma ( apas ) may be interpreted incorrectly by the radiologists as \n iha  on the basis of ct findings of bilateral nodularity or normal - appearing adrenal glands [ 1013 ] . \n thus , it is a simple matter to explain why nodular enlargement could be a predictive factor of functional lesions . \n meanwhile , this also suggests that if incidentally detected lesions were nodular enlargements , evaluating its functional status should be a priority . \n in addition , the present study suggests that lesions on the left side were likely to be nonfunctional . \n in addition , there was only one patient with malignant lesion in the present study , and thus we were unable to analyze incidence of malignancy . \n incidental adrenal enlargement is a frequent radiographic finding and it is accompanied by diverse clinical factors that require proper diagnostic evaluation and management . in functional evaluation ,",
         "aim . to investigate incidental adrenal enlargement clinical characteristics and functional status and analyze functional lesion risk factors . materials and methods . \n this retrospective study included 578 patients with adrenal imaging features showing enlargement . \n incidental adrenal enlargement cases ( 78 ) were considered eligible . \n demographics , functional diagnosis , adrenal imaging features , and concomitant diseases were analyzed . \n results . \n the number of adrenal enlargements and proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement increased each year . \n mean patient age was 50.32 years . \n thirty - nine cases had unilateral enlargement on the left side and 3 on the right side ; 36 had bilateral enlargement . \n routine medical checkup was found to have the greatest chance ( 43.59% ) of revealing clinical onsets leading to discovery . \n biochemical and functional evaluation revealed 54 ( 69.23% ) cases of nonfunctional lesions , 12 ( 15.38% ) of subclinical cushing syndrome , 6 ( 7.69% ) of primary hyperaldosteronism , 1 ( 1.28% ) of metastasis , and 5 ( 6.41% ) of unknown functional status . \n nodular adrenal enlargement ( or , 7.306 ; 95% ci , 1.72728.667 ; \n p = 0.006 ) was a risk factor for functional lesions . \n age and lesion location were not significant factors . \n conclusion . \n incidental adrenal enlargement is a frequent radiographic finding and is accompanied by diverse clinical factors that require proper evaluation and management . \n nodular adrenal enlargement was a risk factor .",

         "septic arthritis of the shoulder is uncommon in adults . it is a surgical emergency as joint destruction occurs rapidly and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality . \n a 43 years old male came to our outpatient department with complaints of pain and stiffness of his left shoulder . on examination , his shoulder movements were severely restricted . \n further evaluation with mri revealed septic arthritis of left gleno - humeral joint for which emergency arthroscopic debridement was done . \n septic arthritis of shoulder may not present with classical clinical features . hence , a through clinical and radiological evaluation will help us prognosticate and treat accordingly thereby preventing complications like septic shock , osteomyelitis . \n patients with septic arthritis usually develop moderate to severe joint pain , warmth , tenderness , effusion , restricted active and passive motion , and sometimes redness . \n we report an unusual presentation of shoulder septic arthritis in a 43 years old man with no other clinical signs and symptoms of classical septic arthritis . \n a 43-year - old man presented to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic with 2 months history of pain and limited range of motion in his left shoulder . \n his pain was insidious in onset , mild to moderate in intensity , aggravated by activities and associated with moderate rest and night pain . \n patient was diagnosed as frozen shoulder at an outside facility and had been given intraarticular depomedrol 40 mg injection for the same 40 days ago with no improvement in his symptoms . \n he is diabetic and has liver cirrhosis and is on treatment . on physical examination , \n the skin colour and temperature of the left shoulder were normal , but the shoulder was tender to touch over the anterior joint line . \n mri was obtained [ fig 2 ] which showed extraosseous soft tissue enhancements around left shoulder with soft tissue abscess in inter muscular planes of supraspinatous , infraspinatous , subscapularis . \n blood test revealed normal white cell count with normal differential count , crp-13.4 mg / l ( normal<5.0 mg \n the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised , at 88 mm / hour ( normal range , 0 - 20 mm / hour ) aspiration of shoulder joint was performed and fluid was sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture , afb staining , mycobacterium culture , and mycobacterium genetic testing . \n arthroscopic lavage of the joint was done and articular fluid sent for repeat aerobic and anaerobic culture . \n joint visualization was markedly limited because of severe inflammation and fibrinous changes of the joint . \n the articular cartilages of glenoid and humeral head were completely eroded down to the bone . \n susceptibility of the isolate was determined with the disk diffusion method and it was susceptible only to colistin . \n 3 ) fibrocollagenous and fibrovascular inflammed connective tissue containing proliferated blood vessels and perivascular mixed inflammatory cells and lymphoplasmacytoid cells . \n based on preoperative and intraoperative culture report , a definitive diagnosis of polymicrobial septic arthritis of the shoulder was established and patient was treated with combination antimicrobial treatment . \n our patient had muted inflammatory response probably due to immunocompromised state ( cirrhosis and diabetes ) which is not uncommon . \n most often it is hematogenous seeding of shoulder joint , however it can also happen after intraarticular steroid injections . \n septic arthritis of the shoulder is more common in immunocompromised patients and intravenous drug abusers . in this case report , the patient had atypical clinical symptoms and is immunocompromised and his primary source of infection seems to be hematogenous . \n our experience with this patient highlights the importance of maintaining high index of suspicion for septic arthritis in immunocompromised patients presenting with atypical shoulder pain associated with stiffness . in the setting of suspected septic arthritis , \n our initial pre - investigation diagnosis was atypical shoulder pain and stiffness of non specific etiology in an immunocompromised patient and infection was part of the differential diagnosis not the only diagnosis . \n esenwein et al in his report highlighted the importance of early intervention to prevent chondral damage , osteomyelitis and also to prevent systemic spread . \n various authors have highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and management of septic arthritis failing which could lead to osteomyelitis and septic shock . in our patient \n , the diagnosis was delayed due to atypical presentation and over reliance on clinical findings at an outside center . \n we strongly recommend early imaging studies in immunocompromised patients presenting with shoulder pain and practitioners should avoid loosely diagnosing as shoulder pain with associated stiffness as frozen shoulders . \n klinger et al . did a retrospective study on 21 patients who underwent surgical treatment for septic arthritis of the shoulder joint between 2000 and 2007 , and he concluded that patients with symptoms for less than 2 weeks did well with arthroscopic approach and early infection can be managed arthroscopically . \n our reports show that arthroscopic washout can give good result even after 2 weeks of clinical symptoms if there is no evidence of osteomyelitis . \n septic arthritis of the shoulder is very often due to hematogenous spread and diagnosis is often clinical . \n laboratory investigations and imaging studies like mri and usg may be useful in establishing the diagnosis but confirmation is usually by joint aspiration . \n patients who are immunocompromised and have insidious onset of moderate to severe pain and which fails to respond to trial of conservative treatment should be subjected to either ultrasound or mri instead of x - ray because very often in these group of patients it is primarily a soft tissue pathology like impingement , rc tear , calcific tendinitis or rarely infections and malignancies . \n we recommend that moderate pain of more than 4 weeks duration with severe stiffness in immunocompromised patient ( liver cirrhosis , renal failure , steroid treatment ) should be further evaluated with mri or ultrasound in the setting of normal x - ray and should not be loosely diagnosed as frozen shoulder . \n goldenberg in his report emphasized the role of local as well as systemic factors that predispose patients with cirrhosis to gram - negative bacterial joint infections . \n malnick also reported a case of spontaneous septic arthritis in a cirhottic patient that was due to e.coli . \n our study as well as other studies by goldenberg and malnick highlight the importance of including broad spectrum antibiotics with gram negative cover whilst waiting for final culture sensitivity . \n septic arthritis of shoulder may not present with classic clinical features . a through clinical and radiological evaluation should be executed and treatment initiated promptly to prevent complications like septic shock and osteomyelitis . \n the case highlights the importance of establishing anatomical and pathological diagnosis using mri in patients with shoulder pain instead of loosely diagnosing them as impingement or frozen shoulder . \n the case also challenges the practice of routine shoulder depomedrol steroid injection , in the setting of secondary frozen shoulder , atleast in immunocompromised individuals . \n primary idiopathic frozen shoulder is a rare condition and secondary frozen shoulder cases are often due to underlying shoulder pathology .",

         "the study of long bones and the cells of the bone marrow is central to a myriad of research disciplines , including , but not limited to , bone biology , cancer biology , immunology , hematology , and biomechanics . \n the bone is a highly dynamic organ that together with the cartilage forms the skeleton to provide mechanical support against loading and protection of the internal organs . \n in addition , the mineral components of bone are a storage sink for the critical signaling molecules calcium and phosphorus , as well as other factors . \n finally , bones house the bone marrow and , together with metabolically active bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts , provide the stem cell niche necessary for the maintenance of hematopoietic and lymphoid cell populations . \n bone and bone marrow are affected in many disorders , often leading to bone marrow dysfunction , severe bone pain , and pathologic fracture . \n bone is a common site of metastasis in many solid tumors , most notably breast cancer and prostate cancer , where tumor cells directly engage the bone marrow niche to initiate the vicious cycle of bone metastasis and displace hematopoietic stem cells . \n hematopoietic malignancies including myeloma and leukemia are characterized by bone marrow dysfunction as well as deregulation of healthy bone remodeling . \n other non - malignant skeletal disorders are also active areas of research , such as osteoarthritis , osteoporosis , scoliosis , and rickets . even in an otherwise healthy individual , biomechanical failure in a bone \n all of these disorders represent active areas of research with the goal of identifying new preventative measures and treatment regimens to reduce morbidity and mortality . to research the plethora of roles of the bone and the bone marrow , both under physiologic and pathologic conditions \n , it is critical for researchers to have a simple and efficient standardized method for dissection of the mouse long bones for rapid processing of large in vivo experiments . \n the dissection protocol outlined here is suitable for all long bone analyses including ex vivo imaging , histology , histomorphometry , and strength testing , among others . \n similarly , a standardized bone marrow isolation method with high bone marrow cell recovery and low inter -

induced fracture or bone scoring that may influence downstream analyses . \n in addition , the centrifugation method for isolating bone marrow does not require cutting the bone to expose the bone marrow space or fluid to flush the bone marrow , reducing potential points of contamination . \n moreover , the centrifuge technique is relatively high - throughput with lower hands - on time than other methods , thus reducing processing time . \n high variation is inherent to in vivo mouse studies due to high mouse - to - mouse phenotypic variation . in order to maximize the research impact of expensive and labor - intensive mouse studies , it is critical to minimize technical experimental error . \n time from animal sacrifice to downstream analysis or tissue fixation introduces experimental variation that may overcome subtle changes and reduce large differences between groups . \n the long bone dissection and bone marrow isolation techniques described here are optimized for rapid processing of animals and samples to reduce technical variation . \n this protocol can be widely applied to many research fields , including investigation of the bone tissue itself or interrogation of the cells of the bone marrow . \n in addition , this straightforward approach to long bone dissection will enable researchers in related fields to directly interrogate bone contributions in order to expand our knowledge of bone marrow dysfunction in otherwise understudied pathologies . \n ",
         "investigation of the bone and the bone marrow is critical in many research fields including basic bone biology , immunology , hematology , cancer metastasis , biomechanics , and stem cell biology . despite the importance of the bone in healthy and pathologic states , however , it is a largely under - researched organ due to lack of specialized knowledge of bone dissection and bone marrow isolation . \n mice are a common model organism to study effects on bone and bone marrow , necessitating a standardized and efficient method for long bone dissection and bone marrow isolation for processing of large experimental cohorts . \n we describe a straightforward dissection procedure for the removal of the femur and tibia that is suitable for downstream applications , including but not limited to histomorphologic analysis and strength testing . \n in addition , we outline a rapid procedure for isolation of bone marrow from the long bones via centrifugation with limited handling time , ideal for cell sorting , primary cell culture , or dna , rna , and protein extraction . \n the protocol is streamlined for rapid processing of samples to limit experimental error , and is standardized to minimize user - to - user variability .",

         "tuberculosis ( tb ) is a major health issue in developing countries with over two billion people being infected with tuberculosis bacilli world wide ( 1 ) . although tb was recently regarded primarily as a disease of the developing countries it is now also on the increase in developed countries such as the united kingdom , mainly as a result of globalisation as well as an increase in immunosuppressed patients . \n figures by the health protection agency ( hpa ) show that the cases of tb in the uk increased by 5.5% in 2009 when compared to those in 2008 ( 2 ) . \n this caucasian patient presented to the emergency department with sudden pain localised to the ulnar aspect of her wrist . \n x - ray of the forearm was normal and she was treated conservatively but was lost to follow up . \n she presented again at the orthopaedic clinic 26 months later with continuing swelling and pain . \n ultrasound showed a synovial tumour on the dorso - medial aspect of the wrist ( figure 1 ) . \n ultrasound showing a synovial tumour on the dorsal medial aspect of the wrist however , special stains for fungi and acid fast bacilli were negative . \n subsequently the patient developed a sinus and continued to have a chronic discharge from her left wrist . \n x ray this time showed destruction of the ulnar styloid consistent with a bony infection ( figure 2 ) . \n mri showed destruction localised around the ulnar head with oedematous changes extending up the shaft of the ulna ( figure 3 ) . \n ap xray of the wrist showing destruction of the ulnar styloid consistent with a bony infection . \n soft tissue swelling can also be noted over the dorsum of the wrist mri showing localised destruction around the ulnar head . \n the mri also shows thickening around the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon in keeping with marked tenosynovitis at this site . \n the patient agreed to a repeat biopsy and excision of the necrotic bone ( figure 4 ) . \n microscopy of the specimen again showed a florid granulomatous inflammatory process with areas of fibrinoid necrosis . \n post - operative xray of the wrist showing excision of the ulnar styloid further enquiry revealed that our patient had been experiencing lethargy but no other features to suggest tuberculosis . \n following the diagnosis of tb , the patient recalled that in her former post as a nursing assistant , when she was much younger , she was exposed to patients with tb . \n although improvements in its management and treatment are continuously occurring an estimated 1.8 million people died of tb in 2008 ( 1 ) . \n extra - spinal tuberculous osteomyelitis is rare and comprises about 2 - 3% of all cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis , with the hip and knee joints being the most common following spinal involvement ( 3 ) . \n tuberculous involvement of the ulna is uncommon and tends to be more common in the diaphysis . \n a high index of suspicion of tb is important to obtain the correct diagnosis . in chronic soft tissue and bony infection \n the diagnosis of tb may not be evident from the history and examination and indeed no obvious risk factors may be present as in our case . in our patient \n the infection could have been contracted at a much younger age , when she was caring for patients infected with tuberculosis , and remained latent . \n however no other risk factors were evident that could explain why the disease was activated after such a long period of latency . \n it is also interesting to note that the actual distal radio - ulnar joint was not involved , most of the destruction being situated around the ulnar process . \n although localisation of the tuberculous infection in the bone without joint involvement can occur , this is rare ( 3 ) .",
         "tuberculosis ( tb ) is a major health issue in both developing and developed countries such as the uk . \n healthy individuals who contract the infection have only 5 - 10% chance of converting to the active disease over their lifetime . \n we present the clinical history of a 76 year old female who attended the emergency department complaining of wrist pain , and was only diagnosed with tb after three years . \n this case report emphasises the importance of including tb in the differential diagnosis when treating patients with an infection resistant to conventional antibiotics , even though risk factors for tb may not be evident or special stains for tb are negative .",

         "the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy , although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma . \n they seem to be different from those of regular antiepileptic medications ( aeds ) , and discovering what they are may lead to its use in clinical situations other than epilepsy as well . \n the kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction . \n although there is some debate about the last component , clinical practice has shown that stopping fluid restriction can lead to seizure recurrence much in the same way as when stopping glucose restriction . \n the most important result of observing the diet is the increased blood level of free fatty acids ( ffas ) . \n the ffas are transferred into the mitochondria , a process which requires the presence of an appropriate amount of carnitine , where they are degraded into ketone bodies through  oxidation . \n these ketone bodies include  hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , and acetone   ( figure 1 ) . \n the effect of the increased amount of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd . \n the degradation of the ketone bodies delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl - coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . unlike glucose , which requires a transporter to cross the blood brain barrier , \n the ketone bodies penetrate it easily . when this transporter is deficient , as in glut 1 deficiency , the kd is the preferred way of antiepileptic treatment , since it allows for bypassing the need for glucose . \n children in whom the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - coa is blocked , for instance , in pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) deficiency , will also benefit from bypassing this route . \n hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body measured in the blood , and it is used to monitor the degree of ketosis during therapy . \n the breath of a patient who is ketotic while on the diet will often even smell of acetone . \n acetone is one of the ketone bodies that have an anticonvulsant effect in several types of mouse seizure models . \n the mechanism of this effect is unknown , although an effect on k2p channels has been proposed .   by means of the tca cycle , \n acetyl - coa increases the level of the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) and the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in brain , respectively . \n another product of an elevated level of free fatty acids is polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) . \n the potential ability of pufas to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with some rather more complicated mechanisms , including ( 1 ) directly inhibiting voltage - gated sodium and calcium channels , ( 2 ) activating a lipid - sensitive potassium channel , ( 3 ) enhancing the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability , ( 4 ) activating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- ( ppar ) , and ( 5 ) inducing the expression and activity of brain - specific uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria , thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect . \n neuroprotection can contribute to the anticonvulsant effect , but it may have other effects as well , which can lead to other clinical uses of the kd . \n appleton and de vivo   reported that the kd increased the total quantity of bioenergetic substrates ( adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) ) and elevated the energy charge in rat brain . \n acetoacetate , a product of  hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenation , is transferred into acetyl - coa which enters the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle . \n the increased turnover of the tca cycle generates protons and electrons that are channeled to the electron transport chain . \n this , in turn , drives the formation of atp from adenosine phosphate ( adp ) by atp synthase . \n enhanced atp can either be converted to phosphocreatine for energy storage or broken into adenosine . \n enhanced atp levels provide energy reserves for a neuron to continue functioning under stress . increased extracellular adenosine offers a neuroprotective buffer against insults , reduces excitation , and averts excessive atp demands , thus providing local seizure control and neuroprotection . \n it was also suggested that the kd influences toward an upregulation of transcripts encoding energy metabolism enzymes and increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal process , leading to heightened energy reserves . \n an improved energetic status can support seizure prevention , for instance , by supporting gabaergic inhibition . \n it is suggested that adaptive processes to the metabolic changes induced by the diet lead to changes in gene expression which in turn result in some of the above - noted changes . \n other path of neuroprotection is modulated through decreased generation of ros which is considered to be related to pufas effect on uncoupling proteins . \n the fact that the kd is considered a proven therapy with relatively few adverse affects and wide clinical experience , particularly in children , led to recent studies investigating new potential uses for other neurological disorders . \n one of the most intriguing and active fields of research is the effect of a high - fat caloric - restricted diet on the survival of brain tumors cells . \n it is hypothesized that mitochondrial abnormalities impair the ability of brain tumors to generate energy from ketone bodies . unlike normal cells , \n malignant tumor cells have impaired genetic adaptability due to their genetic abnormalities and , therefore , increased susceptibility to environmental stress , such as fasting or caloric restriction . \n the same genomic defects that are involved in the creation of brain tumors can be exploited for their destruction [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] .   in 1995 , nebeling et al \n .   reported two young girls with unresectable advanced stage brain tumors who had poor response to radiation and chemotherapy . \n they were treated with a kd and their response was remarkable , both clinically and according to positron emission tomography follow - up scans . \n described a patient with glioblastoma multiforme whose tumor , which is very malignant , improved on the kd . surprisingly , despite the appealing efficacy of this treatment , no further human studies or clinical trials on the kd as a therapy for brain tumors have been conducted . \n several laboratory studies in mouse and rat models have recently confirmed that inhibition of brain tumor growth is directly related with reduced levels of glucose and elevated levels of ketone bodies . \n moreover , the kd was shown to reduce reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the brain . \n cancer cells need high levels of ros for the induction of angiogenesis and the production of tumor growth factors , thus , through this mechanism the kd can be protective . \n the clinical manifestations were mainly intractable seizures that necessitated repeated admissions to the intensive care unit , as well as severe cognitive and alertness decline . \n after the oncologists decided that antitumor treatment would be ineffective , she was started on the kd . \n after four weeks of trial , it did not have any effect on the tumor progression . \n however , it did have a notable improving effect on cognition , alertness , and mood of the girl , in spite of her devastating condition . \n the beneficial effect of the kd on cognition , alertness , and mood is well recognized , and clinical experience shows that in many times it is not less important than the anticonvulsant effect . \n the potential neuroprotective effect of the kd was what motivated investigations into its potential as a treatment option in other neurologic disorders . \n there are increasing numbers of reports that ketosis achieved by starvation or administration of a kd has a consistent neuroprotective effect after various brain injuries in animal models . \n one human pilot study and several animal model studies have shown improvement in autistic behavior parameters with kd treatment . \n it remains to be further clarified whether this improvement is related to reduced epileptic activity found in up to 30% of these patients or to a primary effect of the kd . \n a factor that can be crucial for the application of the kd in medical conditions other than intractable epilepsy is the inherent difficulties in its use . \n dietary restriction can pose a significant problem in a child with a progressive tumor that undergoes massive chemotherapy , who may already be cachectic . \n the kd may not be an option in a grown - up hyperactive autistic child . \n thus , the neurologist must evaluate the appropriate clinical , familial , and environmental situations very cautiously prior to the recommendation of the kd . in conclusion , \n the major metabolic effect of the kd is in supplying the brain with an increased amount of free fatty acids . \n their degradation into ketone bodies , together with the load of pufas , leads to major changes in the metabolic , bioenergetic , mitochondrial , and even genetic constellation . \n whether it may also be effective in other pathologies , especially in treating malignancies , awaits future research .",
         "although the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been widely accepted as a legitimate and successful therapy for epilepsy and other neurological disorders , its mechanism of action remains an enigma . \n the use of the kd causes major metabolic changes . \n the most significant of them seems to be the situation of chronic ketosis , but there are others as well , for instance , high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) . \n these  primary  influences lead to  secondary  , in part adaptive , effects , for instance changes in mitochondrial density and gene expression . \n clinically , the influences of the diet are considered as anticonvulsive and neuroprotective , although neuroprotection can also lead to prevention of seizures . \n potential clinical implications of these mechanisms are discussed .",

         "the endotracheal tube ( ett ) should be placed at the optimal level to avoid inadvertent complication . \n if the ett is too deep , it increases the risk of unintended single lung ventilation . \n on the other hand , if the ett is too shallow , it may cause vocal cord injury by the ett balloon or accidental extubation . \n there are many methods for determining the appropriate depth of ett in adults ; fixed insertion depth according to sex ( 23 and 21  cm from the upper incisors in adult males and females , respectively ) , the use of depth marks on the ett , suprasternal palpation of the ett tip or cuff , and bilateral auscultation . \n although chest radiography and bronchoscopy are considered an accurate method , they are not always feasible and the costs are considerable . considering the individual variation in the length of the trachea , using fixed depths or marks on the ett may result in inadequate placement of the ett . to reduce the risk of single lung ventilation or vocal cord injury , the segment between the proximal edge of the cuff and the ett tip should be placed at the mid - trachea level . if the length of the trachea can be predicted at bedside before intubation , the ett can be placed at a safe depth for each patient . \n the purpose of this study was to determine whether surface anatomical landmarks can be used to predict the mid - tracheal level in adult patients . \n neck computed tomography ( ct ) images of adults obtained between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed by a single reviewer after obtaining approval form seoul national university hospital institutional review board ( july 17 , 2015/no . \n patients with laryngeal , tracheal , or thoracic abnormalities , tracheostomy or significant tracheal deviation caused by mass lesions were excluded . \n in addition , poor ct image quality , absent sagittal ct images , ct images that did not cover the entire trachea , or ct images taken in neck hyperextension ( boidin angle > 130 on scout view ) or hyperflexion ( boidin angle < 110 on scout view ) position were also excluded . \n levels of subglottic and tracheal airway segments that include the vocal cords ( vc ) , the cricoid cartilage ( cc ) , and the carina were identified using the method described by sirisopana et al . \n the vocal cords were identified as the most cranial level of the upper airway , with a teardrop shape below the laryngeal ventricle . anatomic level of suprasternal notch ( ssn ) \n the level of manubriosternal junction ( msj ) was defined as the middle level between the manubrium and the body of the sternum where the second rib attaches to the sternum . \n the level of carina was defined as the bifurcation of right and left main bronchus and identified by the figure 8 shaped lumen . \n the external locations of the cc , ssn , and msj were defined on the skin surface . \n the distances between the external points of the cc and the ssn ( extcc -

ssn ) . compared with males , extcc - ssn more \n accurately predicts the mid - tracheal level in females . in clinical practice , physicians can use extcc - ssn to determine the depth of ett so that the segment between the proximal edge of the cuff and the ett tip lies at the mid - tracheal level . \n there are several studies that used the distance between the surface anatomical landmarks to estimate the airway length and the optimal insertion depth of endotracheal tube . \n lee et al showed that the distance between the upper incisor and the manubriosternal angle in the neck extension position correlates with the distance between the upper incisor and the carina in the neutral neck position . \n evron et al used the sum of the 2 distances from the mouth angle to the jaw angle and from the jaw angle to the sternal manubrium to determine the depth of ett \n . however , these methods are complicated than single measurement of extcc - ssn due to the difficulty in locating the sternal manubrium , more than 1 measurement , and the need for full neck extension . \n the physicians can easily apply our method with a simple measurement of the extcc - ssn to estimate the mid - tracheal level , and apply this depth during endotracheal intubation . \n however , according to previous studies in adults , flexion and extension of the neck from neutral position are associated with the inward and outward movements of the ett . \n conrardy et al showed that the orally intubated ett can move 1.5 ( range 0.52.0 ) cm toward the carina during flexion and 2.4 ( range 1.34.3 ) cm away from the carina during extension . \n kim et al showed that the ett can migrate 1.3 ( sd 0.6 ; range 0.52.5 ) cm toward the carina during flexion and 1.7 ( sd 0.8 ; range 0.43.1 ) cm during extension . \n therefore , the position of the neck should be considered when determining the optimal depth of the ett . \n first , this study was a retrospective analysis of ct images and the distances were measured in the neutral position . \n second , since the vc is used as a baseline of the depth of intubation in our method , it can be difficult to apply our method to patients with high cormack grades . \n lastly , the efficacy of this method is yet to be demonstrated in clinical practice . in conclusion , \n the mid - tracheal level , which is considered the optimal depth of ett , can be predicted by the surface distance between the cc and ssn in adults , especially in females .",

         "embryos generated through assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) are deemed surplus when , for some reason , they are not used for reproductive purposes ( svendsen and koch 2008 ; haimes and taylor 2011 ) ; instead , they are then disposed of or , where this is allowed by a country s art regulation , may be donated for a variety of research purposes . \n thus , the generation and subsequent fate of embryos that are designated surplus are determined as much by legislation as by embryo biology or technological constraints . \n for example , legislatures differ in whether cryopreservation of embryos is permitted , meaning that in some countries any ivf embryos not immediately transferred for pregnancy are surplus , while in others they may be frozen for later transfer . in some countries , the law considers surplus embryos as the primary source of material for human embryonic stem cell ( hesc ) research , while in others this use of embryos is expressly forbidden . \n although hesc research has been subjected to exhaustive ethical scrutiny , the lack of consensus on the ontological or ethical status of surplus embryos means that the uses to which they may then be put remain contested ( deckers 2007 ; guenin 2008 ; moller 2009 ) . \n even if using human embryos for stem cell research is deemed permissible , ethical issues continue to emerge as new social practices and roles develop around the act of embryo donation . \n the relative novelty of these practices and roles , complicated by the pace of change in technical possibility and regulation , mean that there is still uncertainty about how to conceptualise embryo donation , not just in terms of systematic ethics but as a sociomoral practice in everyday social life and morality ( banks , scully , and shakespeare 2006 ) . from a sociological perspective , and also to understand more generally how everyday morality deals with unprecedented ethical dilemmas , it is important to examine which conceptualisations emerge as salient and how they are stabilised and used . \n for example , one way of thinking about the donation of embryos to research is as a bodily gift relationship , one of the many established by modern biomedicine such as the donation of eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes , organs or tissues for transplantation , blood for transfusion , and other biological tissues for research . \n drawing analogies to existing practices in this way has proved helpful in other instances of bioethical novelty ( hofmann , solbakk , and holm 2006 ) . \n however , analogies can equally well be misleading , if there are morally relevant but unacknowledged differences between situations . \n the contexts in which different organs and tissues are donated vary significantly , and these differences influence the sociomoral understanding of donation in each case and make them noncomparable in ethical terms \n . reproductive tissue , for example , is generally distinguished from other types of donated tissue because eggs , sperm , and embryos have the potential to give rise to new individuals , not just to prolong the lives of existing individuals , or to be used for research . because embryos are generally considered to have a different moral status from other tissues , the use of surplus embryos in research raises moral unease about the instrumentalization of human life that is not raised in quite the same way by the donation of either ova or sperm . \n it is therefore unclear whether an embryo can meaningfully be treated as a  gift  (  donation  ) without blurring the morally relevant differences between embryos and other tissues . \n similarly ,  hesc research ,  to which the embryo may be given , is a domain of biomedical practices and not an entity . as such \n , hesc research is not a subject with which a gift relationship can be established ( unlike , for instance , an organ recipient ) . \n understanding the social and ethical meanings that are emerging for the practices associated with embryo donation calls for a detailed empirical examination of people s reasoning behind donation decisions . \n however , most empirical studies of embryo donation have not focused on people s donation rationales in depth ( with some exceptions ; for example , haimes et al . 2008 ; de lacey 2003 ) . \n the scarcity of data on donor rationales means there is a corresponding lack of information on contextual and other factors that influence donor decisions and how these can be related to the evaluations of theoretical ethics . \n the authors of this paper have been involved in a series of linked qualitative studies of practices of embryo donation , first in the united kingdom ( researcher haimes and colleagues ) , then switzerland ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz ) , and in a smaller pilot project in china ( mitzkat , rehmann - sutter , and haimes ) . \n all three studies shared an interest in understanding reasons for the donation or non - donation of embryos . while the studies in switzerland and china drew upon the original u.k . \n design , each study was conducted independently , and the details of each project , including interview design , differed in light of the varying regulatory , clinical , and cultural contexts . however , by looking across the three data sets , we hope to gain cross - cultural insights into donation and non - donation rationales and the moral understandings on which they are based . \n the three studies all used open - ended , semi - structured , one - off interviews between the researcher and people who had been in the position of deciding whether to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n interviews were designed to explore in depth not just the interviewees decision about donation but also the background to that decision , such as their ivf story , their family and other relationships , their relationship with the clinic and its staff , and so on . \n the interviews were transcribed , coded , and initially analysed to identify the reasons for donation decisions given by participants in each study , using an interpretative approach that all of us have previously found useful for identifying key themes around decision - making and implicit or explicit ethical judgements ( charmaz 2006 ; smith , flowers , and larkin 2009 ) . \n study ran for more than three years ; after some familiarisation and observation in the collaborating clinic , 44 in - depth interviews were conducted with couples who had been asked to donate their surplus fresh embryos , generated through ongoing ivf treatment , to hesc research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ) . in the united kingdom , it has been possible for some years to donate unused embryos to stem cell and other kinds of research and also to other couples . \n the swiss study was carried out shortly after a change in the law that permitted fresh or cryopreserved surplus ivf embryos , under strictly defined conditions , to be donated to stem cell research only . in this study , 17 individuals who had variously chosen to donate or not to donate were interviewed ; thus , the decision concerned the fate of cryopreserved embryos some time after the ivf treatment that had produced them ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . the chinese work involved a much smaller three - month pilot study carried out in a large art hospital . \n it was designed as a pilot to provide a comparison with the u.k . and swiss material and is , therefore , included here despite the low number of participants , but with no attempt to draw general conclusions from it . \n legislation in china does not allow the donation of embryos to other couples , but consent can be given for a surplus embryo to be used in stem cell research or for it to be discarded . \n the study included participant observation of the information and consent procedures and qualitative interviews with five ivf patients , three choosing to donate to stem cell research and two refusing ( mitzkat , haimes , and rehmann - sutter 2010 ) . \n for the purposes of this paper , the authors involved in the studies jointly compared the rationales for donation decisions given by their participants . \n we also independently reexamined interview transcripts for material relevant to the discussion of gratitude . in the rest of this paper , we first identify and compare the main reasons given by participants in these three studies for their decisions to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n we then look in more detail at the implications of our findings for one area of potential ethical concern : the possible role of gratitude in making embryo disposition decisions . in this way \n , we not only collect empirical data to help understand the emerging moral meaning of a new practice , but also give an example to show how empirical data can be used to question and then refine the conceptual basis of bioethical theory . \n participants who chose to donate their surplus embryos to research had a background premise that donation is fundamentally permissible because embryos do not have the sort of ontological or moral status that would forbid it . \n the swiss study discovered people stating this explicitly :  [ embryos ] are not , they are not yet people ; they are nt beings with souls as far as i m concerned ,  as one swiss participant said.1 but this did not mean that the surplus embryos were considered as morally equivalent to any other tissue , and participants in both the swiss and u.k . \n interviewees stopped themselves midway through sentences referring to the  left over embryos ,  which they clearly felt , on reflection , was an inappropriate phrase . \n so the embryos did not have the sort of moral status that would have made it wrong to donate them , but neither were they completely disposable . \n to some of our participants , embryos had a value ; they were a precious resource ( haimes et al . \n 2008 ) that made simply throwing them out an unjustifiable waste . as another u.k . \n [ i]t just really seemed a waste , really , not to have them used . \n it was not always clear , however , quite how interviewees were using this notion of  precious  : whether with reference to economic  bio - value  ( waldby 2000 ; waldby and mitchell 2006 ) or because they had been obtained at intense personal and emotional cost , or because they had high moral value , or possibly a combination of all these aspects \n . particularly in the swiss study , which involved cryopreserved embryos stored for some time , participants referred to embryos moral status in a nuanced way that was highly sensitive to the developmental stage of the embryo , its physical location ( whether inside or outside the body ) , and its state ( whether cryopreserved or not ) ( see scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . \n studies seemed less interested in explicitly defining  the  moral status of an abstract embryo than working out what their own particular embryos meant for them at defined points in their own story , and what this meaning then indicated it was morally permissible for them to do with that embryo . \n across all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research . \n such research was seen as a valuable endeavour by those like the swiss participant who said ,  i feel that , fundamentally , research has to go on , and i support that . \n donation of their spare embryos to research was therefore seen as a morally good act , based on a kind of ethical arithmetic in which simple disposal produced zero good from the surplus embryo , while donation had the potential to do good by supporting research . as one u.k . \n interviewee said ,  it was quite simply that  we ve been helped by the system , we should help the system back.  not because of some sort of martyrdom or heroics or anything like that , just quite simply that without such efforts things do nt progress .  in the u.k . \n study there was an added imperative to donate surplus embryos to research as there had been a lot of press coverage about the hoped - for curative outcomes of stem cell science : \n i think the research is very important , like it was in the news a while ago to say that [ the senior clinician ] was successful in stem cell research and that s what you need in order to provide medical assistance in the future , so i m all for it . \n this observation raises a separate ethical concern about the patients understanding of the information they were given about the research goals . here \n in the swiss study , the notification from the clinic storing the frozen embryos stated clearly that donation was to stem cell research , yet the majority of donors we interviewed who referred to research did so in terms that were directly relevant to infertility . \n a lot of preparatory work , research work , went on before medicine was advanced enough that it was possible for us to have children . \n [ t]his is now maybe a tiny tiny contribution , that we can give back , if we now donate a , er , fertilised egg , perhaps for further research . \n note that in the chinese pilot study none of the participants spoke in precise terms about the research involved ; however , they described it broadly as \n one chinese interviewee said she did not really know what the research was about , but trusted the doctors and hoped it would help other infertile women . in switzerland , \n the donors were former ivf patients donating cryopreserved embryos ; in china , they were current ivf patients donating either fresh or cryopreserved embryos . in neither of these studies \n were participants asked outright if they thought their donated embryo was being used in infertility research . \n however , the fact that they used phrases such as  helping others as we have been helped  ( italics added ) indicates a potential misunderstanding . \n it raises the possibility that if they had been fully aware that the research undertaken with their embryos did not concern infertility , participants might have chosen against donation . the u.k . \n participants had much clearer ideas about the research to which they were being asked to donate ; they knew that it was not for research on fertility issues . \n these participants , as in the chinese study , were current patients donating fresh embryos . \n the differences in comprehension are therefore unlikely to be due to the request context ( former vs. current patients or fresh vs. frozen embryos ) in itself . however , in the u.k . \n study participants were asked to decide whether or not to donate to a number of specific projects , for each of which the goal and methodology was explained in detail , orally and in writing . \n it is possible that this level of engagement with the detail of the research underlies the difference . \n it will be important to clarify this , and to identify best practices for maximising patient comprehension of the research goals , because if ( as our material indicates ) the type of research to which people donate is a relevant factor in their moral evaluation , then the question of whether they fully understand its nature is ethically crucial . as we have seen , some of our participants reasoned that if their embryo was not going to be used for pregnancy , then donating it to a good endeavour ( research ) would be more meaningful than simply discarding it . \n for example , one interviewee said :  if we ve created life that we , or i , do nt want any more , then maybe it s least sinful , or however you want to put it , if something meaningful happens to it . \n i feel a little bit guilty sometimes , not very much , but a little bit like  if we can at least give these embryos for a good reason , then it was nt completely in vain .  using similar wording , another said ,  if i ve already gone a bit astray , and in a sense we ve produced life , erm , then at the very least something meaningful should come out of it . \n our interpretation of their statements is that they felt they had ( inadvertently ) done something wrong in  creating life  but then not using that life as intended in pregnancy , and that donation to a good endeavour would in some way make up for this wrong . \n ( we want to be quite clear here that we are not arguing that failure to use an ivf embryo in pregnancy actually is a moral wrong , only that some of our participants said that in their case they felt so . ) \n they did not indicate that they felt their use of ivf in itself had been wrong , but articulated the sense that in ending up with surplus embryos they had done something less than ideal . \n for these swiss participants , then , their donation decision appears to have been driven in part by what we could call a reparative urge . \n no indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below . \n across all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research . \n such research was seen as a valuable

indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below . \n approximately half of the swiss participants who were interviewed turned out to have decided against donation and instead have their surplus cryopreserved embryo(s ) destroyed . \n none of these explicitly used the moral status of the embryo as the fundamental basis for rejecting donation to research . \n the scientists  would do with their embryo , which was articulated either as disapproval of specific types of research ( e.g. ,  not if it s for cloning  ) or as a more general unwillingness to relinquish responsibility of the embryo to unknown others . in both sets of reasoning , therefore , participants were expressing unease about the loss of control over what would happen to their embryo . \n the two chinese interviewees who had opted against donation also did so because of reservations about lack of knowledge of exactly what the embryos would be used for , explicitly mentioning the fear that they would be donated to ( i.e. , used to generate pregnancy in ) other women . \n in addition , two of the swiss participants gave financial reasons , that is , they expressed anger that they would not be compensated for giving up their embryo and that through donation researchers were  getting something for nothing . \n study , speculation about why some people might refuse to donate raised concerns about what might be done with the embryos and whether a baby would be developed through experimentation ; others wondered if  refusers  were worried that another infertile couple would receive their embryos and have a baby when they , the embryo providers , failed to do so . \n sample contained only two actual refusers , who objected on the grounds of possible use in animal research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ; hug 2008 ) . \n these observations provide material for an empirically grounded bioethics of the ivf  stem cell interface ( franklin 2006 ) . in the rest of this paper , we consider a single aspect in detail : the potential  problem  of gratitude influencing informed consent . \n empirically , the main reasons given by our participants for donation were : ( 1 ) to avoid the waste of a precious resource , ( 2 ) to give something back to research , and ( 3 ) to compensate for a perceived moral wrong . in none of the three countries \n did our participants indicate that their decision arose out of any sense of gratitude to the physician who had given them ivf treatment . \n this is an important observation , because the possible impact of gratitude on informed consent in embryo donation has previously been raised by bioethical commentators . \n it has been suggested that if there is any institutional or procedural link between ivf treatment and hesc research , the potential donors gratitude toward the clinicians who have helped them to conceive may steer them toward opting for donation ( haimes and luce 2006 ; parry 2006 ; mcleod and baylis 2007 ; also discussed in roberts and throsby 2008 ) . \n the bioethical concern is that parents who receive the  gift of a baby  will feel a sense of gratitude ; feeling grateful might then cause parents to feel that they should respond with a gift in return ; and if a request for donation of surplus embryos is made in that context , potential donors might inadvertently be encouraged to see donation as an appropriate form of return gift . in this way \n the moral emotion of gratitude could compromise the potential donor s freedom to weigh the pros and cons of the request , which in turn means compromising the capacity to give fully voluntary consent . \n even where the clinicians and researchers themselves are scrupulous about not using persuasion , gratitude might be persuading potential donors to do something they would not otherwise choose to do . to avoid this possibility , countries that allow embryo donation for research may attempt a strict separation of ivf treatment and the stem cell research domain . \n ( not all legislatures do this , however : china is one country that does not . ) in the united kingdom , for example , it is accepted good practice that requests for donation of spare embryos should not be made by the physician(s ) who delivered the original ivf treatment . in switzerland , \n a predominant interpretation of the current law on embryo donation is that a couple undergoing ivf treatment should not be told even of the theoretical possibility that a surplus embryo might be generated unless it actually is ( porz et al . \n regulators hope to rule out any conflict of interest on the part of the treating physician as well as the possibility of gratitude on the part of the patient . \n there are several theoretical questions that can be asked about a claim that the  risk  of gratitude affects potential donors decisions . \n for example , moral psychologists might want to examine the emotional exceptionalism in which gratitude is seen as potentially compromising , while other emotions , or even the absence of emotion , is not . \n there is also an obvious empirical question which does not seem to have been closely examined : whether potential embryo donors actually do experience a sense of personal gratitude to the physician  or one strong enough to sway their donation decision . \n however , they do indicate that participants rationales for donation indicate a desire to  give back  in a more complex way . \n first , our empirical results show the importance of distinguishing between the three moral emotions of gratitude , indebtedness , and solidarity . \n what we normally mean by gratitude is an emotion primarily associated with gifts or with help that is undeserved . \n gratitude has been defined as  a feeling of thankful appreciation for favours received  ( guralnik 1971 , 327 ) and is experienced as a positive emotion . \n ( 2006 ) provide a basis from experimental psychology for distinguishing between indebtedness and gratitude . \n one important distinction is that  indebtedness is an emotion of exchange , whereas gratitude is not  ( watkins et al . \n even if a debt of gratitude is felt ,  it does not appear to be analogous to an economic debt \n indebtedness , however , is , literally , a debt : a  state of obligation to repay another  ( mauss 2001 , 2 ) . \n a further feature associated with indebtedness but not with gratitude is the inherent imbalance of power , so that a hierarchy is created in which those who are indebted are rendered more vulnerable . the empirical social psychological work of watkins et al . \n indicates that , in experimental settings at least , a person s feelings of gratitude diminish as the expectation of return ( indebtedness ) increases . the more reciprocity is expected or demanded , \n importantly for considering the effects of these social emotions on donation decisions , watkins et al . found that the greater the expectation that something will be given back in return , the less motivated the participants were actually to comply with the norm of reciprocity ( watkins et al . \n these results suggest that if patients were to sense any expectation of return by an individual physician or researcher , it would if anything lessen any gratitude they might have felt . in the ivf context , what people have received ( the thing for which they might feel grateful ) is their baby or pregnancy , or at the very least , treatment . donors who achieve this have not received a gift , but a medical service , which will have been paid for in one way or another . in switzerland , where ivf is not covered by the mandatory health insurance \n , this will often be direct payment from the patients to the clinic , as it will also often be in china . in the united kingdom , \n patients who do not already have children commonly receive two  free  cycles of nhs treatment ( paid for through taxes on the population ) , and then they pay for future cycles directly through fees to the clinics . whatever the system of payment , however , the point is that the ivf physician or clinic has already been paid , directly or indirectly , for the treatment which produced the outcome . \n so in the case of embryo donation , it could be argued that neither gratitude nor indebtedness should be anticipated . \n gratitude would not be expected , because what patients have received was not a favour or unexpected gift ; and indebtedness would not be expected , because there is no debt if payment has already been made . in our three studies , although we found appreciation and high esteem were expressed for the work of the treating hospital or team , we found no evidence of gratitude being expressed toward an individual physician . \n this is despite the fact that in both the united kingdom and china mention was made of the well - known head physicians who led each clinic ; the mentions were in appreciation of their reputations , not as a debt of gratitude . \n participants wanted to do something with the surplus embryo that would be of benefit to research and medical treatment for infertility , but this was not directly associated with the physician who provided it originally . indeed , some of our interviewees were critical of aspects of their own ivf treatment , while still wanting to support the infertility research enterprise overall . in this context , it should be remembered that about half the swiss participants interviewed in fact chose not to donate , primarily out of anxiety about losing control over the fate of their embryos , but also in some cases because it meant researchers were  getting something for nothing . \n study , a few patients were suspicious that research was being prioritised over treatment and that embryos might have been kept back for the research rather than frozen . \n although only a small number of participants expressed this view , it has particular relevance here as it indicates clearly the absence of either gratitude or indebtedness : indeed , it suggests that these participants felt that , if anything , donation would mean the researchers were receiving something beyond their entitlement or were indebted to the patients rather than the reverse . \n social exchanges may entail giving back not to an individual , because the individual may be unknowable or because the benefit may not have come from a single identifiable person , but to  the pattern of social life \n ( becker 1986)for example , giving back to the institutional biomedical research that had helped the participants . in serial reciprocity , person a receives something from person b , but pays back not to person b but to some other third party ( moody 2008 ) . serial reciprocity accounts for the way that altruistic blood donors often do describe their action in terms of reciprocity , even though they have not received anything from the person to whom their blood eventually goes . \n what drives serial reciprocity is not gratitude or indebtedness to an individual or an organisation but a sense of solidarity with unknown others in the community . in the case of embryo donation , what appears to be a directly reciprocal act of gratitude  a surplus embryo in return for treatment  may thus be understood as something quite different . \n participants in our studies used a rationale for donation based not on reciprocal exchange between individuals , but on  giving back to  a research enterprise from which they had benefited and which they hoped would benefit unknown others in the future . for the swiss and chinese donors who choose to donate because they think they are supporting infertility research , these unknown others are not completely anonymous : they are  known  because of imaginatively shared experience .  giving something back  to the research that had helped them ( as they think they are doing ) \n was not considered an obligation but , rather , a form of return that was meaningful and seemed especially fitting to them because of the experiences they had gone through . in the u.k . \n study , although there was greater clarity about the purpose of the research being contributed to , there was still a sense among embryo providers that they were benefiting from the fact that others had participated in research in the past which had improved ivf ; they were clear in expressing solidarity with this imagined community of previous ivf research contributors by making their own contributions to research , albeit research in another domain . \n at least some of our participants , then , also see their donation to research as an indirect way of passing on the benefit they have received from research to someone else , whose situation in some way resembles their own . \n the social meaning of this indirect reciprocity is neither gratitude nor indebtedness , but solidarity with other present and future patients . \n to summarise : our interpretation of the material suggests that donors reasons for donating were not connected in any straightforward way to either gratitude or indebtedness . for some people \n the desire not to waste a valuable ( in more than one sense ) resource is foremost . \n a generally positive stance toward biomedical science means that donation is a good use of a valuable resource . with some of the swiss participants \n , we also identified a reparative urge coming from a sense of moral unease , and here donation seems to offer a route through which the urge to make reparation can be satisfied . \n all of this suggests that neither gratitude nor indebtedness per se are present in decision - making at the ivf  stem cell interface , at least not in terms of undue inducement or of compromising the capacity for informed consent . \n the reparative urge foregrounds a different set of ethical questions about the sociomoral meaning of the generation of spare embryos and the act of donation . \n for example , the perceived need for reparation that appears to drive some of the swiss participants donation choices arises because people felt some sense of wrongdoing at creating embryos that are not used for pregnancy . \n the spirit of the swiss legal framework strongly reinforces the sense that the occurrence of embryos not used for pregnancy is to be considered as wrong . from this point of view \n , one possible conclusion could be that the felt desire for reparation is in fact an ethically appropriate response : if the act of deliberately creating an embryo is a morally significant one , which needs to be justified by the good of its intended outcome ( pregnancy ) , then not using it for the purpose that justifies it does indeed present a genuine ethical difficulty . \n on the other hand , the novelty of surplus embryos in the swiss legal and social context ( scully and rehmann - sutter 2006 ) meant that many patients would have been unaware at the time of their ivf of the possibility of generating a surplus embryo . \n moreover , in most cases there were perfectly valid clinical or legal reasons why the embryos could not be transferred , which fully justified the failure to use them as originally intended . that these factors were not in the participants control \n the swiss participants were quite aware of the valid reasons why their embryos could not be transferred , and yet some of them still said that they had fallen short of some moral standard . \n we suggest that this persistent unease ( which does not appear so prevalent in the u.k . \n these are captured in swiss legislation s highly defensive attitude toward embryos in general and the generation of surplus embryos in particular . \n swiss law operates from the presumption that a surplus embryo is an exceptional event that will happen only through the failure of regulation and practice specifically set up to prevent it ( porz et al . \n in addition , as we discussed earlier , the generation of surplus embryos is still an unfamiliar social practice and the role of the embryo donor is one that lacks widespread cultural recognition . in the swiss context of legal exceptionalism , then , producing one of these culturally unfamiliar entities may more readily be understood as something \n wrong  for which reparation is in order . in the more permissive cultural and legislative context of the united kingdom , although some interviewees expressed guilt about other aspects of the process ( for example , inappropriate styles of speech about embryos ) , there was no sense that not using the embryos as intended in itself constituted a moral failing . \n if our interpretation is correct , as the creation of surplus embryos becomes normalised in swiss society and the role of embryo donor becomes normalised in both the u.k . and \n swiss ( and other ) societies , there will be a shift in ideas about the moral meaning of surplus embryos , and this should be empirically testable . for the majority of the participants in switzerland and the united kingdom who chose to donate their surplus embryos , donation decisions were not driven by a reparative urge but by the feeling that donation expressed solidarity with research and/or other patients . \n what our empirical work shows is that gratitude to an individual must be distinguished from a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research . \n however , this does not necessarily mean that solidarity - based reciprocity has no relevant impact on the capacity for voluntary consent . \n one possible consequence , for example , is that if potential donors feel solidarity with the research enterprise , or with present and future patients , then they might also experience an obligation to support it . \n however , in all three studies there were people who chose not to donate ( about half of the swiss interviewees did not donate , while in the united kingdom approximately 46 percent of those asked have been shown to opt against donation [ choudhary et al . \n 2004 ] ) , which suggests either that there is no sense of obligation , or that it is neither universal nor irresistible . \n there is a second problem if solidarity - based reciprocity is taken as something to be prevented . \n if there is a risk that gratitude felt by an individual could influence donation decisions , then the risk can be minimised by separating ivf and stem cell research physically and procedurally , as bioethicists have suggested and some clinics and guidelines have implemented . \n but if instead there is a desire to benefit research or to show solidarity with collective  others  rather than an individual , then what sort of physical or procedural barriers could be set up to prevent it having an influence \n ? there are further theoretical questions to be explored here about the assumption that contextual emotions such as gratitude or solidarity compromise the decision to donate . \n the situation in which donation of a surplus embryo is a possibility comes about as a result of a variety of social , cultural , political , legal , and emotional features that combine to make the situation what it is . \n it will be important to identify carefully the features that are constitutive of the situation of having a surplus embryo ( including a sense of solidarity to similar others , emotional bonds with the embryo that change over time , regret over the failure to use all embryos for pregnancy , and so on ) and to consider whether these constitutive features can or should also be treated as factors that compromise the responsible , autonomous decision - making capacity of the people involved . \n this introduces the question of the extent to which any decision to donate can be detached from its context and the contextual factors that shape how people respond to donation requests . \n finally , we should not forget that the possibility that some donors misunderstand the kind of research they are donating to raises some ethical difficulty . \n it means that donors may be deciding for donation out of a misplaced sense of solidarity  a different ethical problem . \n the deliberative processes of the donor participants in our three studies incorporated their appreciation of the particular moral value of their own embryos and of the value of biomedical research . \n these deliberations are complex , and the participants own dependency on pre - existing medical research and their affiliation with others in similar situations must be recognised , we suggest , in order to understand how they might configure donation as a means to cope with the moral ambivalence of the situation in which they find themselves . \n their decisions are not driven by some unacknowledged sense of debt , but rather are responsive to the emerging social and moral reality of embryo donation in the first decade of the 21st century .",
         "this paper is based on linked qualitative studies of the donation of human embryos to stem cell research carried out in the united kingdom , switzerland , and china . \n all three studies used semi - structured interview protocols to allow an in - depth examination of donors and non - donors rationales for their donation decisions , with the aim of gaining information on contextual and other factors that play a role in donor decisions and identifying how these relate to factors that are more usually included in evaluations made by theoretical ethics . \n our findings have implications for one factor that has previously been suggested as being of ethical concern : the role of gratitude . \n our empirical work shows no evidence that interpersonal gratitude is an important factor , but it does support the existence of a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research . \n thus , we use empirical data to expand and refine the conceptual basis of bioethically theorizing the ivf  stem cell interface .",

guided neurosurgery ( igns ) devices allow the use of coregistered and fused multimodality 3d images to guide the surgeon 's hand and help define preoperatively the boundaries of pathological and predefined functional structures . meanwhile \n , new modes of medical imaging have also improved the localization of pathological lesions and their characterization . \n medical imaging nowadays includes a wealth of different techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( smri and fmri ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) . \n although the overall accuracy of igns is estimated to be 12  mm , current neuronavigation systems can not , however , adapt to changing conditions over time . \n skull - opening brain shift , brain retraction , cerebrospinal fluid suction , lesion resection , perfusion , and pharmacological manipulation during surgery indeed all alter the 3d morphology of the structures [ 25 ] . \n these changes can lead to localization errors that are one order of magnitude larger that igns accuracy [ 1 , 2 , 6 ] and may result in incomplete resections or unexpected damage to normal brain . \n such inaccuracies could be reduced if one could acquire , throughout surgery , fresh images of the same modalities and quality as the preoperative ones \n intraoperative images such as intraoperative mr ( imr ) images are  with the exception of a handful surgical facilities  usually acquired using low - field mri scanners that provide lower resolution and contrast than their preoperative counterparts , and , to this date , several useful imaging modalities , such as pet and possibly meg , can not be acquired intraoperatively . \n one solution is to  bring over  the high - quality preoperative multimodality images into the intraoperative configuration of the brain using a nonrigid registration technique [ 710 ] . \n one category of nonrigid registration techniques uses physics - based models , where landmarks are tracked in successive reduced - quality intraoperative images , and their displacement fields drive the deformation of a biomechanical model . \n so far , most of the mechanical conditions of the brain can not be estimated in the operating room , such as the volume of cerebrospinal fluid flowing out of the skull cavity , intercellular fluid volume changes that result from mannitol injection , or changes in blood volume and vessel permeability . \n the fact that an intraoperative image can provide the knowledge of the current state of the brain after some deformation partly eliminates the need for a complete evaluation of these mechanical conditions . \n the nonrigid registration technique replaces them with the landmark displacements evaluated from successive intraoperative images . using a nonrigid registration technique based on a biomechanical model , three types of brain deformations \n have been identified that require specific modeling , although they depend on common parameters , such as csf suction , perfusion , or pharmacological manipulation . \n the first deformation is the brain shift , which appears at the beginning of surgery with the opening of the skull and dura . \n the suction or leakage of csf , as well as the release of intracranial pressure caused by tumor growth , generally cause such shift of the brain ( note that in this work , we name  brain shift  the specific shift of the brain that occurs after the opening of the skull and dura , before any other surgical act has happened ) . \n however , for these deformations , we will consider that the shift is a part of these two deformations . \n the second deformation is the retraction ; when target tissues are located deep inside the brain , the surgeon incises brain tissues and inserts a retractor to spread out the tissues , and to create a path towards the target . \n the third deformation is the resection , that is , the removal , of lesion tissues . \n three deformations can thus be defined in terms of the two elemental actions that change the topology of the brain : the introduction of a discontinuity and the removal of some tissues . \n most studies of brain deformation based on biomechanical models have focused on shifts ( the topology of the brain is not modified ) , that occurs just after the opening of the skull and dura [ 1125 ] . \n a good review of these different studies can be found in [ 24 , 2628 ] . \n resection and retraction are more complex to model than ( brain ) shift . until recently , \n their modeling for the specific application of preoperative image update has received much less attention . \n one of the difficulty for modeling resection and retraction is that both induce a topological change of the brain because some tissue are cut . \n a method of mesh adaptation [ 2931 ] or remeshing [ 3235 ] must be used in conjunction with fem if an accurate representation of the location of the cut , for example , the resection cavity or retraction path , is needed to deform the model . indeed , fem can not directly handle discontinuities that go through the fes , and requires to realign the discontinuity with fe boundaries . in the field of fracture mechanics , which studies the growth and propagation of cracks in mechanical parts \n , some methods were developed to avoid using fem in conjunction with mesh adaptation or remeshing . \n the extended finite element method ( xfem or x - fem ) appeared in 1999   and has been the object of considerable research since then . \n xfem works by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within some fes of the mesh . \n the mesh does not have to conform to the discontinuities , so that these can be arbitrarily located with respect to the underlying fe mesh . because xfem allows an accurate representation of the discontinuities \n while avoiding mesh adaption or remeshing , and because of the similarity between cracks in mechanical parts and cuts in tissue , we proposed the use of xfem for handling cut , resection , and retraction in the updating of preoperative images . \n this paper presents a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal preoperative images with respect to surgical brain deformations , due to brain shift and successive resections , followed and quantified using imr images . \n our approach is modular , and is applied iteratively each time a new intraoperative image is acquired . \n we take into account successive deformations based on a linear elastic biomechanical model which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the pair of imr images under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection . \n while some 3d results have already been presented for brain shift , and initial 3d results for resection   modelings , this paper is the first complete and detailed account of the generalization to 3d of our 2d previous work . \n we present the state - of - the - art of resection modeling for preoperative image update . in section 3 \n , we describe our basic strategy for updating preoperative images based on successive intraoperative images . in section 4 , we give detail about our methods and algorithms . in section 5 , \n we consider two patient cases that illustrate our approach for handling brain shift followed by successive resections . \n among studies that take into account resection for preoperative image update , one should distinguish two categories . \n the first category of studies models brain deformation using two time - point images , the first image being acquired before surgery has started , the second image being acquired after resection . in this category , \n the methods that existed for a second image showing some brain shift are adapted for a second image showing some resection . \n the second category of studies models brain deformation using more than two time - point images , and models at least two successive resections . among the first category of studies , \n hagemann et al .   developed a 2d method for modeling brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and a postoperative mr image , the postoperative image showing a complete resection . \n the 2d mesh of the biomechanical model corresponded to the underlying pixel grid of the 2d image . \n the biomechanical model included four different linear elastic laws for the skull / skin region , the whole - brain region , the csf region , and the image background . \n they computed the correspondence of the skull boundary , the whole - brain region boundary in the neighborhood of the tumor , and the posterior midline between the two images . \n they also computed the correspondence between the internal tumor region boundary visible in the preoperative image , and the resection cavity boundary visible in the postoperative image , both boundaries corresponding under the assumption that the resection is complete . \n the displacements fields of these landmarks drove the deformation of the biomechanical model . as a result , the biomechanical model presented high deformation in the tumor region , which is not physically plausible . \n however , the resection was complete , and , thus , they were not interested by the displacement field of the biomechanical model in the tumor region itself . \n clatz et al .   developed a 3d method for modeling the brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and an imr image , the latter showing partial or complete resection . \n the biomechanical model was deformed based on a sparse volume displacement field evaluated from the two images , using a block matching algorithm . in their algorithm , blocks of voxels that presented discriminant structures were selected in the preoperative image . \n the blocks were then matched to blocks in the imr image using a similarity criterion , for example , a coefficient of correlation . \n the value of the similarity criterion was used as a value of confidence in the displacement measured by the block matching algorithm . \n the biomechanical model was then deformed iteratively , driven by the sparse displacement field of the matched blocks , where a block rejection step was included for measured block displacements initially selected but considered as outliers . in the imr image , a part , or the totality , of the tumor tissues \n the blocks were thus selected and matched in only the healthy - brain region of the two images . \n they tested their algorithm on six patient cases , and used for validation nine landmarks picked up manually in each image . \n they found a mean and maximum error on displacements of 0.75  mm and 2.5  mm , respectively . \n they explained this phenomenon by the fact that a substantial number of block matchings were rejected in the tumor neighborhood . \n the deformation of the biomechanical model in the tumor neighborhood was thus essentially governed by the linear elastic law , and the result might show the limitation of this model . \n archip et al .   also tested the nonrigid registration method presented in   on eleven patient cases , and used the 95% hausdorff distance   for evaluating the alignment of the nonrigidly registered images . as a result \n , they obtained a mean error of 1.82  mm . among the second category of studies , miga et al . \n they built a linear poroelastic biomechanical model and preoperatively tagged the tetrahedron fes that were going to be removed to simulate the brain deformation due to successive resections . \n second , a boundary condition was applied to the new boundary of the resection cavity , in order to model the relaxation of strain energy , induced by preoperative tumor growth or surgery acts , stored in the resected tissues , and released after their removal . in this approach , \n the tissue discontinuity was represented as best as possible with a jagged topology defined by the fe facets defining the boundary of the resection cavity . \n [ 45 , 46 ] also modeled the removal of tetrahedra in order to model the action of an ultrasonic aspirator in the context of real - time surgery simulation . \n [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] modeled successive resections based on several time - point imr images . between two successive images \n , they deformed the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , to take into account the ( partial ) resections(s ) that took place between these two images . \n first , the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , was deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain boundary between the pair of images under consideration . \n second , the fes that fell into the resection cavity in the second image of the pair were removed , while the fes that laid across the resection - cavity boundary were cut . to ensure the link between the successive deformed configuration of the biomechanical model , their algorithm kept track of the topology modification between fes and nodes of the mesh before and after the removal of fes . \n they tested their algorithm on one patient case including five imr images ( the first two imr images being used for brain shift modeling ) , and used for validation thirty - two landmarks picked up manually in each image . \n they found a mean and maximum error on the displacements of 0.9  0.7  mm ( mean  standard deviation ) and 3.7  mm , respectively . \n they explained this phenomenon by the limited accuracy in the process of picking landmarks in that region , and because the retraction occurring between the second and third images was modeled as a resection , that is , a removal of tissues , even though the tissues were not removed but simply spread out . \n the methods described above have been all developed using an fem - based biomechanical model for intraoperative image registration . \n the objective of a surgical simulator is to provide an interactive manipulation with force feedback of the anatomical part to be operated using various surgical instruments . in order to model a large range surgical procedures , \n jebkov and kuhlen   have applied nonlinear xfem for simulating cut , and have shown that xfem is successfully efficient for such purpose . \n the block diagram of figure 1 shows our global approach for updating preoperative images using successive imr images acquired at different critical points during surgery . \n although the principles of the approach are quite general , they are tailored for use based on images acquired with a 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner , which guarantees that the full volume of brain tissues is included in the image field of view . in our present strategy , \n the preoperative images are updated incrementally . at the end of each update , the preoperative images should be in the best possible alignment with the last imr image acquired . \n prior to surgery , a patient - specific biomechanical model is built from the set of preoperative images . because the patient does not necessarily lie in the same position during the acquisition of each of the preoperative images \n , one may need to perform a rigid registration ( involving translations , rotations , and scales ) to bring these images into correspondence , assuming , in first approximation , there is no local , that is , nonuniform , brain deformation between preoperative images . \n once the 1st imr image has been acquired prior to the opening of the skull , the set of registered preoperative images and the biomechanical model are registered to the 1st imr image via a rigid transformation . in the present situation , it is assumed that the patient 's brain imaged in the 1st imr image has the same physical shape as the brain imaged in the preoperative images ( note that in the following , when an imr image is defined by a number , this number is the index of the imr image in the series for a specific patient case . \n the 1st imr image thus corresponds to the very first imr image of the series ) . as each imr image \n is acquired , this new image and the preceding imr image are used to estimate the deformation of the brain . \n the update of the preoperative images is done incrementally with each new pair of successive imr images . for each pair , we proceed as follows . a set of common anatomical landmarks \n the use of surface structures rather than volume structures   seems more appropriate given the reduced - quality of typical intraoperative images , and would be more easily adapted to intraoperative modalities other than imr , such as ius . \n the landmark surface displacement fields resulting from the matching are then applied to the biomechanical model , which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the acquisition times of the imr images in the pair under consideration , namely , brain shift , or resection . \n the resulting displacement field of the biomechanical model is finally used to warp the set of preoperative images in their current state of updating . \n note that , for each deformation modeling , the biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the landmark displacements tracked between the pair of successive imr images under consideration . because intraoperative deformation can follow a reverse direction , it is important to track the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images , rather than track the landmarks between the first and the last acquired imr images . for the patient cases treated in section 5 , we assume that the brain undergoes relatively small deformations ( small strains and small displacements ) , and we use a linear finite - element formulation in the biomechanical model . \n a consequence of using this linear formulation ( linear elasticity ) is that the equations of solid mechanics can be solved based on the initial configuration of the solid . \n actually , knowing the displacement field increment un = u  u at the anatomical landmarks between configuration n and increment n + 1 , one can apply this constrained displacement field increment un to the initial configuration , and the finite element analysis will lead to the deformation tensor increment n between the configuration n and n + 1 . \n the final deformation tensor or the body is thus simply obtained from  = k=0k . \n remark that rigorously , the increment of constrained displacement field at the landmark should be applied to the balanced solution of the solid reached after increment n , but as we are using a linear elasticity model , this step can be skipped owing to the superposition principle : if  = c , then  = k=0k = ck=0k = c , where c is the hooke tensor . as a summary , with this approach , \n the process of deformations is modeled as a succession of deformations k , for example , brain deformation composed of shift followed by successive resections and the current configuration of the brain biomechanical model , after a specific deformation can then be recovered by adding the computed volume displacements for all successive incremental deformations . remark \n that this is not a limitation of the method as we could easily extend it to nonlinear model by simply keeping in memory the previous deformed configuration n and adding the constrained displacement field increment un to compute the new deformed configuration at increment n + 1 , simply this would be less computationally efficient . because we use a linear formulation ( and , thus , the incremental volume displacement fields can be added to recover the current configuration of the biomechanical model ) , we could theoretically obtain an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model using the two following approaches . \n the first one would consist of computing and adding the successive incremental deformations of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images . \n the second approach would consist in computing directly the deformed configuration of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the first and the last acquired imr images . \n however , the landmarks selected to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model vary depending on the type of deformation , namely , brain shift or resection . \n in addition , part of the biomechanical model is  cut ,  using xfem , to model resection . \n consequently , we would not get an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model by these two approaches . \n in order to use a maximum of information from the imr images , we track , as explained for the first approach , the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images . \n the problem of updating preoperative images between more than two critical points during surgery , that is , based on more than two imr images , is addressed in only a small number of studies . in our previous work [ 39 , 41 ] , and in \n , the biomechanical model was successively deformed , and this was done using a linear formulation . \n the framework proposed here , where the initial biomechanical model is always used , instead of using it in its successive states of deformation , has the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively deteriorates with each successive deformation modeling , and which would require remeshing or mesh adaptation for getting back good fe quality . to summarize , \n for each deformation , the landmarks are tracked between the two successive imr images under consideration . because we use a linear formulation , \n the displacement fields of these landmarks are applied to the initial , rather than current , configuration of the biomechanical model . \n the resulting volume displacement field corresponds to the deformation that the brain undergoes between the two imr images . \n this volume displacement field is used to deform the preoperative images in their current state of update , that is , registered ( at the previous step , if any ) to the first imr image of the pair . \n after the deformation , the preoperative images are thus in as good as possible registration to the second imr image of the pair . in all the rest of this work , \n we make a simplification of the approach just presented , by using the 1st imr image as a substitute for the preoperative images . \n the biomechanical model is thus built based on structures visible in the 1st imr image , instead of in the preoperative images , and the structures used in the model are limited to the ones visible in the intraoperative image . except for the rigid registration between the preoperative images , the biomechanical model , and the 1st imr image , this simplified approach allows us to discuss , illustrate , and test all key aspects of the system . \n the above strategy allows us to focus on the main issue of this paper , that is , the estimation and handling of 3d deformations . \n even though the issues involved in the update of preoperative images will need to be addressed in a operational image update system , the present strategy of deforming the imr images remains useful for calibration purpose , even in the operating room . \n this section details the different methods that are commonly used for updating preoperative images in presence of brain shift and resection . \n more specifically , the block diagram of figure 2(a ) shows the building of the biomechanical model from the preoperative images . \n specific regions from the preoperative images are segmented , meshed , and assigned appropriate constitutive laws . \n the block diagram of figure 2(b ) shows , for any pair of successive imr images , a detailed view of the calculation of the volume displacement field of the initial biomechanical model that corresponds to the deformation that has occurred between the acquisition time of these images . all along surgery , the patient is lying inside the 0.5 tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner . \n although the patient 's head is fixed , one can not totally rule out the possibility of slight head motion . \n imr images thus have to be rigidly coregistered to take into account this potential rigid motion . \n the rigid registration that we use is the point - based landmark transform available in vtk ( http://www.vtk.org/ ) . \n the segmentation of imr images into specific regions , for example , healthy - brain and tumor regions , is first performed manually using 3d slicer ( http://www.slicer.org/ ) and then smoothed to minimize the dependance of the results on segmentation roughness . \n it is clear that performing a manual segmentation in the operating room is not acceptable , and that this process needs to be automated as completely as possible to test the feasibility of our framework online . \n however , while there exist sophisticated segmentation algorithms that could be used [ 5052 ] , in particular for extracting the whole - brain region ( skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out ) , the segmentation of the tumor region is still challenging . as mentioned above , the biomechanical model is built , in the present context , from the 1st imr image rather than from the preoperative images . thanks to the use of xfem instead of fem for modeling discontinuities , this biomechanical model can be built offline before the operation starts and does not need to be repeated ( through remeshing ) during the surgery . with respect to fem - based approaches , \n the execution time thus ceases to be a limiting parameter , which is a remarkable advantage of our approach . \n it thus requires specific techniques , and we use the meshing software tool isosurf ( http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~gmt11/software/isosurf/isosurf.html ) . our goal is to model the boundaries of healthy - brain and tumor regions as two connected surfaces meshes . \n however , isosurf can only mesh the boundaries of one or several separate regions , and , thus , does not allow one to mesh connected region boundaries with common nodes at their intersections . \n we thus start by building two separate surfaces meshes that we connect using our own routines based on vtk . \n the two connected triangle surfaces are then jointly meshed into a single volume mesh of tetrahedra that conform to the two surface meshes using gmsh ( http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/ ) . \n further details on the building of the biomechanical model , in particular the building of the connected surface meshes , can be found in . \n a linear elastic law is assigned to the biomechanical model , with young modulus e = 3000  pa and poisson ratio  = 0.45 . because displacements , rather than forces , are applied to the model using a linear formulation , the fem or xfem solution is independent of young modulus e . \n we choose as surface landmarks the whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries . to evaluate the surface deformations of these region boundaries between two imr images , we use an active surface algorithm [ 55 , 56 ] . \n because these region boundaries to match must be closed surfaces , we thus use as surface landmarks the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries . \n the surface deformation of the internal tumor region boundary will be derived from the active surface algorithm of the healthy - brain region boundary . in our active surface algorithm coming from [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , the external forces f(x ) are computed using a gradient descent on a distance map of the region boundary . with such external forces , the active surface algorithm is not able to take correctly into account local rigid motion due , as an example , to lateral or tangential movement depending on the head orientation . for the whole - brain region , any rigid transformation that could have occurred \n has already been taken into account by the rigid registration of the imr images ( section 4.1 ) . however , for the healthy - brain region , it can happen that the internal tumor region boundary moves partly in a rigid way . \n therefore , the active surface , initialized from the healthy - brain region boundary in the first imr image , is first locally transformed in a rigid way along the internal tumor region boundary using the iterative closest point transform available in vtk . \n then , this resulting surface is deformed using the active surface algorithm as explained above . \n further details on the local rigid registration of the healthy - brain region boundary can be found in . before applying the displacements whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries to the biomechanical model nodes , \n the two surface displacement fields are smoothed based on a weighted - distance average , that is , the displacement of each node is averaged with the displacements of its n closest neighbor nodes . \n this smoothing will make them consistent with each other , and compatible with the volume mesh in order to avoid element flipping , in particular at the intersections between whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries . \n the displacement fields of the surface landmarks are applied to the biomechanical model , which deforms according to the laws of solid mechanics . \n the equations of solid mechanics are solved using fem or xfem , depending upon the type of circumstances , namely , brain shift or resection . \n we use the fem - software tool metafor ( http://metafor.ltas.ulg.ac.be/ )   developed in our mechanical - engineering department , to which we have added an xfem module . \n the initial stress state of the brain is unknown and is thus set to zero for each fem or xfem computation , as in [ 10 , 13 ] . \n fem discretizes the solid of interest into a mesh , that is , into a set of fes interconnected by nodes , and approximates the displacement field u(x ) by the fem displacement field u(x ) defined as \n ( 1)ufem(x)=iii(x)ui , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the nodal shape functions ( nsfs ) , and the ui 's are the nodal degrees of freedom ( dofs ) . \n each i(x ) is defined as being continuous on its compact support i , which corresponds to the union of the domains of the fes connected to node i . in our approach , we use linear nsfs . \n in contrast , xfem handles a discontinuity by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within fes [ 37 , 5860 ] . \n the xfem displacement field generalises the fem displacement field ( 1 ) with \n ( 2)uxfem(x)=iii(x)ui+iji(x)j=1neigj(x)aji . \n the first term corresponds to the fem displacement field ( 1 ) , where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the fem nsfs , and the ui 's are the nodal fem dofs . the heart of xfem is the  enrichment  that adds a number , n , of dofs aji to each node i of the set j , which is the subset of nodes of i whose support is intersected by the discontinuity of interest . \n these dofs are multiplied by the nsfs i(x ) and the discontinuous functions gj(x ) . \n the use of specific xfem enrichment functions gj(x ) for a node i  j depends on the type of discontinuity , for example , crack , hole , material interface , and so forth , to be modeled . \n suppose that our goal is to model a crack , characterized by a discontinuity in the displacement field ( as opposed to a material interface for instance , characterized by a discontinuity in the derivative of the displacement field ) . \n when the crack fully intersects the support of the node , a simple choice is a piecewise - constant unit function that changes sign at the boundary across the crack , that is , the heaviside function \n ( 3)h(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,1for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where x is again the position of a point of the solid , x * is the position of the point on the crack that is the closest to x , and en is the outward normal to the crack at x * . in case of resection deformation , the goal is to model a discontinuity such that the part of tissues corresponding to tissue removed by the resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues . \n one is actually interested in the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues only . in that sense , \n the hole function    as the following equation :  \n ( 4)v(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,0for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t could be used as xfem enrichment function , instead of the heaviside function , and would be totally sufficient . \n the results that we would obtain on the remaining part of the tissues would be identical . \n however , because the heaviside function is necessary for retraction modeling , we have used the same function for the resection modeling even if it was not strictly necessary . when minimizing the total deformation energy , the resulting xfem equations remain sparse and symmetric as for fem . \n whereas fem requires a remeshing and the duplication of the nodes along the crack to take into account any discontinuity , xfem requires the identification of the nodes whose support is intersected by the crack and the addition of dofs : ( 1 ) any node whose support is not intersected by the discontinuity remains unaffected and thus possesses three dofs ; ( 2 ) any node whose support is fully intersected by the discontinuity is enriched with three heaviside dofs and thus possesses six dofs . to qualitatively estimate the similarity between two images , we compare the edges extracted from these images using the canny edge detector available in itk ( http://www.itk.org/ ) . \n indeed , although potentially useful for the sake of comparing methods on a mathematical basis and defining unique correspondences , landmark - based target analysis presents several relevant limitations in the present setting . having experts picking landmarks introduces significant intra- and interobserver variability . picking landmark points , as ferrant et al . \n did , is rather difficult when it comes to define enough visible landmarks  especially in the tumor region  on the 5 different images ( and not 2 images only , as majority of studies focusing on brain shift are using ) . rather than point targets , linear tumor contours , and limits between structures and potential eloquent structures matter most in the practical case of tumor ablation neurosurgery . \n these are the reason why we chose to use the canny edges in order to evaluate the registration . besides \n , while it is true that these edges do not necessarily physically correspond between the successive imr images , these images have been acquired with the same image protocol ( mr sequence , voxel size , grayscale value range ) , which should limit this problem . \n to quantitatively estimate the similarity of the two edge maps , we compute the modified hausdorff distance between the sets of edge points , that is , voxels representing the edges , in these two images . \n the modified hausdorff distance (a , b )   between two sets of points a and b is defined as \n ( 5)(a , b)=max(h(a , b),h(b , a ) )  with  h(a , b)=1naaad(a , b ) , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where the directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) is a measure of the distance of the point set a to the point set b , na is the number of points in set a , and d(a , b ) is the distance of point a  a to the closest point in b , that is , d(a , b ) = minbb||a  b|| , where ||a  b|| is the euclidean distance . \n the directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) thus computes the average distance of points of a to points of b. the averaging minimizes the effects of outlier points , for example , due to image noise . \n the value of the modified hausdorff distance (a , b ) increases with the amount of difference between the two sets of edges points . in the following , \n we denote by (ia , ib ) the modified hausdorff distance of the edges extracted from the whole - brain region of the images ia and ib , that is , with the skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out from them . \n in this section , we apply our methods , respectively , of brain shift and resection ( imr images are acquired with the 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner of the brigham and women 's hospital , boston , usa . \n imr image size is 256  256  60 voxels , and voxel size is 0.9375  0.9375  2.5  mm ) . \n two patient cases , each including five imr images , are treated to illustrate our modeling and brain shift followed by successive resections . in both cases , the 1st imr image was acquired prior to the opening of the skull ; the 2nd imr image was acquired after the opening of the skull and dura , and shows some brain shift ; the 3rd , 4th , and 5th imr images were acquired after successive resections . \n the modelings of brain shift , 1st , 2nd , and 3rd resection are performed using different techniques , as detailed below . except where otherwise noted \n , the following discussion applies to both patient cases ( the result of each deformation modeling is shown for the two patient cases at the end of section 5.2.3 ) . to model brain shift based on the 1st and 2nd imr images \n , we estimate the surface displacement fields of the whole - brain region boundary and the internal tumor region boundary from the two imr images . \n no tissue discontinuity is involved in the brain shift deformation , so the biomechanical model is deformed using fem . \n this results in the volume displacement field of the biomechanical model , which is illustrated in figure 3 for the first patient case . \n this volume displacement field is used to warp the part of the 1st imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . in the following sections , \n the three successive resections are modeled separately , because they require different types of processing . \n matching two region boundaries to get a displacement field makes sense only if they correspond to the same physical entity . \n once the resection has started , we can no longer rely on the entirety of the whole - brain region boundary , since a part of it is now missing . for modeling the successive resections , we thus evaluate the displacement field for the boundary of the healthy - brain region only . \n the 1st resection occurs between the times the 2nd and 3rd imr images are acquired . \n however , since the corresponding removal of tissues is most likely accompanied by deformation , one can not exactly determine what tissue is removed based just on the two imr images . \n we thus decided to model the 1st resection by still relying on the displacement fields of key surfaces , here the healthy - brain region boundary , to deform the biomechanical model . \n this indeed appears to be the only reliable information concerning the deformation due to resection that we can extract from the 2nd and 3rd imr images . \n consequently , we do not model explicitly the removal of tissue , but we model directly the deformation resulting from it , without introducing any tissue discontinuity . using the surface displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , we compute the deformation of the biomechanical model via fem . then , using the resulting volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 2nd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region , in the same way as we did in the case of for brain shift . \n the image resulting from the 1st resection modeling is now registered to the 3rd imr image , except outside of the healthy - brain region boundary , that is , for the tumor region . finally , we alter the resulting image to reflect the effect of resection . for this \n , we assign the background color to the voxels corresponding to the resected tissue volume \n the significant feature of the 2nd resection is that some tissue has already been removed by the 1st resection , which means that this tissue can not have any physical influence on subsequent brain deformations because it does not \n recall that the biomechanical model has been deformed to model the brain shift and the 1st resection and is thus registered to the 3rd imr image . \n so , using the 3rd imr image , we can define the boundary of the 1st resection , that is , the tissue discontinuity to include in the deformed biomechanical model ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) . \n we then enrich the nodes whose supports are intersected by the discontinuity with heaviside dofs . \n consequently , when the xfem - based biomechanical model deforms , the part corresponding to tissue removed by the 1st resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the brain . \n for the first patient case illustrated in figure 4 , the tetrahedron mesh consists of 3,317 nodes , which corresponds to 9,951 fem dofs . \n the biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 3rd and 4th imr images . \n the bottom part of the mesh , representing the tissue remaining after the 1st resection , has been deformed according to the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , while the top part , representing the tissue removed by the 1st resection , has been subjected to a translation , but only for visualization purposes . even though the mesh is displayed as two separate parts , it is , in fact , a single entity . \n indeed , a main feature of xfem is its ability to handle the effect of a discontinuity without modifying the underlying mesh , that is , without remeshing . for modeling the 2nd resection , the edges of fes straddling the discontinuity \n have been made discontinuous and their nodes moved apart . using the xfem volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 3rd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . \n the resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 4th imr image . \n one significant feature of the procedure described for modeling the 2nd resection is that it can be applied repetitively for each subsequent resection visible on successive imr images , no matter how many there are . \n the modeling of the 3rd resection is thus identical to the modeling of the 2nd resection . \n the tissue discontinuity due to the 2nd resection is defined from the 4th imr image , and used to appropriately enrich the nodes of the biomechanical model . \n then , this biomechanical model is deformed using xfem , in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 4th and 5th imr images . for the first patient case , \n a simplification for the modeling of the 3rd resection can be made because , by the time the 5th imr image is acquired , the resection is complete . \n this means that we only need to compute the volume displacement field of the healthy - brain region . \n since we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem will be identical . \n using the fem ( for the first patient case ) or xfem ( for the second patient case ) volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . the resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 5th imr image . \n figures 5 and 6 show the results of warping the imr images , as well as the edges extracted from them , after brain shift and each successive resection modeling for the two patient cases . as explained in section 5.2.3 , since we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem are identical in the healthy - brain region . \n one can deduce that using xfem for modeling resection is interesting when the neurosurgeon needs to have an accurate displacement field of the remaining tumor tissues . in this case \n , it is interesting to evaluate the impact of using fem , instead of xfem , to model the resection as if no resection was performed before . \n using fem for modeling resection is equivalent to ignoring the presence of resection on intraoperative images . to illustrate the comparison between fem and xfem results , we choose the 3rd resection modeling of the second patient case \n indeed , it is the deformation with remaining tumor tissues that shows the largest magnitude , and , thus , that is likely to give a maximum difference between the two computations . \n the healthy - brain and tumor regions segmented out from the 4th and 5th imr images are respectively shown in figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) . \n the volume displacement fields of the biomechanical model using xfem and fem are respectively shown in figures 7(c ) and 7(d ) . \n the part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region is warped , first with the volume displacement field obtained via fem , and then with that obtained via xfem . \n the difference between the two warped images is shown in figure 7(e ) . as expected \n however , the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution ( although the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution , the difference between the images resulting of the warping using these two volume displacement fields is nonzero . \n this is explained by the fact that the ( gray ) value of each voxel of the warped image is defined as a weighted - value of voxels of the original image . \n the weights are defined based on the overlapping ratio of the voxel of the warped image , with voxels ( determined using the volume displacement field ) of the original image ) . \n in addition , the deformed 4th imr images , using the xfem- and the fem - based deformations of the biomechanical model , show the same similarity , computed based on the modified hausdorff distance , with the 5th imr . \n two reasons explain that the differences between the fem and xfem results are so small . \n first , the brain deformation itself due to the 3rd resection is small , and , thus , it is expected to obtain small differences between the two resulting brain deformations . \n second , in the case the remaining tumor tissues are close to the healthy - brain region boundary , it implies that they are close to the boundary where surface displacement fields are applied to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model . \n although this comparison between fem and xfem should be done on more patient cases , we suggest that , in first approximation , fem could be used for modeling resection cases with small brain deformations . \n nevertheless , the presentation of the successive resections using xfem shows the generality of our framework , and details how xfem is implemented . \n note that in section 6 devoted to validation , the warped images are the ones deformed with xfem . \n for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images that are already rigidly registered , we compare the similarity between these ik and ik+1 images , as well as the similarity between the ik and ik+1 images , where ik is the result of warping ik . \n this gives us an estimate of how well we are able to capture , and compensate for , the local deformations between ik and ik+1 . \n the goal of the nonrigid registration is , however , to deform the preoperative images . by warping ik for each deformation modeling \n , we do not take into account the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . to evaluate the effect of this error amplification on the results \n , we also perform the required succession of warpings on i1 , and we denote the resulting image by i1,k . \n we then compare , for each deformation modeling , the similarity between i1 and ik+1 , together with the similarity between i1,k and ik+1 . \n this allows one to evaluate the propagation , that is , the amplification , of alignment error on the results . \n the modified hausdorff distance computed for each pair of imr images are given in tables 1 and 2 . \n table 1 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (ik , ik+1 ) and (ik , ik+1 ) . \n these values are computed using the canny edges extracted from the pair of images ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( d ) and 6 ( d ) ) and ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( e ) and 6 ( e ) ) . \n we observe that the values for the images nonrigidly registered are relatively constant , that is , 1  mm , for each deformation modeling . \n six out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are ( rigidly and subsequently ) nonrigidly registered . \n however , the modified hausdorff distance increases for the 3rd resection modeling of the first patient case , as well as for the brain shift modeling of the second patient case . to understand \n if the nonrigid registration is responsible for the increase of the misalignment of the two imr images everywhere in the whole - brain region , or if this effect is localized , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the region and neighborhood of the tumor only ( volume region that extents by 25  mm the tumor region segmented in i1 for both patient cases ) . \n the modified hausdorff distance decreases from (i4 , i5 ) = 1.70  mm to (i4 , i5 ) = 1.37  mm for the first patient case , while it decreases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.36  mm to (i1 , i2 ) = 1.28  mm for the second patient case . \n this indicates that the nonrigid registration enhances the alignment of the two imr images within the tumor region and its neighborhood , which is in fact the location requiring the best modeling accuracy . \n this behavior could be explained by the fact that a maximum of information from the imr images is used in this region , that is , one or two ( in case of brain shift modeling ) surface displacement fields are applied around it . \n the increase of misalignment elsewhere in the brain volume could be explained by two reasons . \n first , the landmarks tracked from the imr images are surfaces . as a consequence , the nonrigid registration is expected to give better results near the tracked surfaces than far from them in the volume . \n the volume misalignment could point out the need for better parameters values and/or other constitutive laws . \n table 2 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (i1 , ik+1 ) and (i1,k , ik+1 ) . \n so far , igns systems allow one to rigidly register preoperative and successive imr images . \n (i1 , ik+1 ) thus represents the navigation accuracy that we can obtain with an igns system at the present time . \n the comparison of (i1 , ik+1 ) with (i1,k , ik+1 ) gives the improvement that could be practically achieved in the alignment with our approach . \n as expected , table 2 shows that the igns accuracy decreases through the successive deformations . \n indeed , the modified hausdorff distance increases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.24  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.78  mm for the first patient case , and from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.01  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.68  mm for the second patient case . \n six out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are nonrigidly registered . \n to understand if the modified hausdorff distance increases everywhere in the whole - brain region for the brain shift and 1st resection modeling of the second patient case , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the neighborhood of the tumor region ( in the same way as explained for table 1 ) , and observe the improvement of the alignment within the tumor region and its neighborhood . as opposed to the values of the modified hausdorff distances in table 1 , the values for the images nonrigidly registered in table 2 increase through the successive resection modeling . \n this amplification error is due to the fact that , after having modeled brain deformation between a pair of imr images , the deformed biomechanical model is not in perfect alignment with the second image of the pair . \n since , for the subsequent deformation modeling , the surface landmarks are initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , this can thus ampliy a misregistration error . \n we developed a complete 3d framework for serial preoperative image update in the presence of brain shift followed by successive resections . \n the nonrigid registration technique used an homogeneous linear elastic biomechanical model , driven by the deformations of whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries for brain shift modeling , and healthy - brain region boundary for resection modelings , tracked between successive imr images . \n the biomechanical model was deformed using fem for brain shift modeling , and fem or xfem for resection modeling , depending upon whether some brain tissues were previously resected or not . \n we showed that our approach was modular , and could be applied each time a new imr image is acquired . \n we used a linear formulation to characterize the deformation of the brains of both patients because the brains underwent relatively small deformations and displacements . \n while nonlinear biomechanical models have proven effective to decrease  yet do not abolish  the inaccuracies of fem - based modeling methods of large brain deformations , the deformations observed in our patients during surgery remained moderate ( 47  mm ) , thus reducing the theoretical benefit of using nonlinear models . \n this allowed us to use simpler linear models and focus on the added value of xfem to simultaneously account for surgical deformations , namely , shift and resection . using a linear formulation \n implied that , for each new deformation modeling , one could use the initial configuration rather than the last - deformed configuration of the biomechanical model . \n this had the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively degraded with each successive deformation modeling . \n this also had the advantage that we did no longer need to reconnect the deformed mesh for each new xfem calculation , which was one drawback of our previous method , presented in [ 39 , 41 ] , where the biomechanical model was successively deformed . \n we also showed how xfem could handle a discontinuity for modeling resection without any remeshing or mesh adaptation while the representation of the discontinuity remained accurate , that is , the representation of the discontinuity was not based on a jagged topology using fe facets . \n xfem thus also avoided making the mesh resolution richer in the neighborhood of the resection - cavity boundary for improving the accuracy of the representation of the discontinuity for that purpose only . \n we showed that our nonrigid registration technique improved the alignment of the successive imr images for most of the deformation modeling of both patient cases . when our nonrigid registration failed , it still improved the alignment locally , that is , within the tumor region and its neighborhood . \n we tested the explicit modeling of the lateral ventricles ' region with a soft , compressible law in addition to the whole - brain region law used in the homogeneous biomechanical model . \n in addition to the validation that is usually performed for successive deformation modelings , that is , validation between pairs of successive intraoperative images , shown in table 1 of section 6 or in the work of ferrant et al . \n [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , we also evaluated the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . as a result , shown in table 2 of section 6 \n , we showed that our approach suffered from the propagation of misregistration through the successive deformation modelings . \n we expected that this was due , at least partly , to the algorithms used to evaluate intraoperative surface displacements fields from the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries . \n the surface displacement fields were computed using active surface algorithms , and smoothed to make them compatible with the biomechanical model . \n because of these two smoothings , the deformed biomechanical model was likely to not be in a perfect alignment with the imr image to which it was registered . \n because the surface displacement fields evaluated for the next deformation modeling were initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , we expected to observe an amplification of the misregistration , which was confirmed by our quantitative evaluation . at the present time \n though , commercial igns systems allow one to register preoperative images and successive imr images , but in a rigid way only . \n consequently , although the effect of error amplification exists , our technique still enhances the current capabilities of commercial igns systems . \n future work on modeling of brain shift followed by successive resection is required in five main areas . \n first , the effect of error amplification through the successive brain deformation modelings calls for further research . \n consequently , the segmentation , and the subsequent smoothing , as well as the evaluation of surface displacement fields , should be improved to minimize the effect of error amplification . \n second , further research is required to include additional structures in the biomechanical model in general , and to study the best way to include the lateral ventricles in particular . \n the use of a poroelastic model in order to model the cerebrospinal fluid filling the ventricles could be considered [ 17 , 18 ] . \n indeed , these images provide volume information ( rather than surface information only ) , are of good quality in comparison to other intraoperative modalities , and possess a field of view that includes the full volume of brain tissues ( for the 0.5 tesla ge signa scanner ) . \n these images thus allow one to evaluate what , and how , new structures of the brain could be used , to enhance the modeling of brain shift . \n some regions , for example , the lateral ventricles ' region , could be extracted from the two imr images , and used as surface landmarks to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model [ 13 , 62 ] . indeed , the workflow presented in this paper has the advantage of being easily adaptable . in case \n the tumor region would not be visible ( enough ) on the imr images , these new structures , easier to segment , could also adequately replace the tumor for driving the deformation . \n fourth , our global approach should no longer be based on the 1st imr image used as a substitute for preoperative images , but on the preoperative images themselves . \n fifth , we should implement , for the surgery cases involving large deformations of the brain , a nonlinear formulation of fem [ 63 , 64 ] , and , particularly , a nonlinear formulation of xfem , which is the subject of recent research [ 65 , 66 ] .",
         "current neuronavigation systems can not adapt to changing intraoperative conditions over time . to overcome this limitation \n , we present an experimental end - to - end system capable of updating 3d preoperative images in the presence of brain shift and successive resections . the heart of our system is a nonrigid registration technique using a biomechanical model , driven by the deformations of key surfaces tracked in successive intraoperative images . \n the biomechanical model is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection . \n we describe the operation of our system on two patient cases , each comprising five intraoperative mr images , and we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the alignment of nonrigidly registered images .",

         "acquired angioedema ( aae ) , an acquired deficiency of c1esterase inhibitor , is a medically treatable condition which can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen . \n this disorder is strongly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) and other indolent lymphoplasmacytic disorders . \n we describe a patient with known cll who developed incapacitating , recurrent severe abdominal pains , culminating in partial bowel resection . \n wider appreciation of the possibility of aae , particularly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders , could lead to preventive therapy and spare unnecessary surgery . \n acquired angioedema ( aae ) is due to acquired deficiency of c1 inhibitor ( c1inh ) , resulting in excessive complement and bradykinin activities . \n blood vessel permeability is increased ; thus , angioedema occurs . just as with hereditary angioedema ( hereditary c1inh deficiency ; hae ) , common clinical manifestations are skin swelling , laryngeal edema , and/or abdominal pain.1,2 aae often occurs in the context of lymphoplasmacytic disorders , such as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance ( mgus ) , non - hodgkin s lymphoma , or chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll).1,3 among 32 patients with aae , castelli found that 13 ( 40% ) had mgus and 9 ( 28% ) had lymphoproliferative disease.3 therefore , all cases of aae should be evaluated for the possibility of underlying lymphoplasmacytic disorder . \n conversely , when patients with known lymphoproliferative disease manifest compatible symptoms , aae should be expeditiously considered . \n this is important because aae can be effectively treated medically , but delayed diagnosis can lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures , therapeutic interventions , or life - threatening complications , well - illustrated by our case . \n a 78-year - old woman with atherosclerotic vascular disease was transferred to our hospital with abdominal pain and underwent emergent laparotomy . \n one year earlier , she had been diagnosed with rai stage i cll which had been observed without treatment . \n two months earlier , she presented with severe abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting . over the next 8  weeks , she had six emergency room and/or hospital admissions for identical symptoms . \n pains would begin at rest in the lower abdomen , spread to the upper abdomen , described as  gas - like  , non - radiating , constant . \n extensive evaluation included colonoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , magnetic resonance angiography , and abdominal aortography . \n benign colon polyps and small gallstones were removed , mesenteric stenoses ruled out , yet pains recurred unabated . \n there was no dysphagia , change in bowel habits , gi bleeding , fever , or sweats . \n physical examination on transfer revealed blood pressure 130/88  mmhg , pulse 88 beats per minute , respiratory rate 20  cycles per minute , pulse oximetry of 95% on ambient air , and temperature 97.0f . \n hemoglobin was 18.1  g / dl , hematocrit 55% , platelets 146    10/l , and leukocytes elevated to 34,500 cells/l with 47% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes . \n ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with iv contrast showed multiple abnormal loops of small bowel with contrast - enhanced bowel wall edema ( fig . \n . 1a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast shows several abnormal loops of small bowel with a target appearance indicating bowel wall edema . \n b a section of small bowel shows massive submucosal edema . there is no infiltration of the wall by lymphocytes a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast shows several abnormal loops of small bowel with a target appearance indicating bowel wall edema . \n b a section of small bowel shows massive submucosal edema . there is no infiltration of the wall by lymphocytes at laparotomy , massively swollen small bowel was encountered and resected . \n c4 was 3  mg / dl ( normal 1746 ) , c3 66  mg / dl ( 85200 ) , and c1inh activity reportedly 83% ( 68200% ) . \n serum protein electrophoresis revealed two faint bands immunofixing as monoclonal igm kappa and igg kappa . \n lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy improved and c1inh activity increased to 110% . over 3  years of follow - up , abdominal symptoms never recurred . \n approximately 145 cases have been reported of aae,3 and this is one of four cases that we have diagnosed in the last decade with abdominal pains from aae with associated cll . \n table  1 shows characteristics of patients with cll and aae we have seen ( some briefly mentioned in a prior report).4 this is our only case to undergo surgery , allowing unique and dramatic demonstration of massive bowel edema visible radiographically , on surgical inspection and on histopathology . \n an initial c1inh activity was reported low normal , but there can be no doubt about the diagnosis based on radiologic / surgical / histologic findings , further laboratory results , and the clinical course . \n characteristic are very low c4 level and low c3 ;

         "brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . to evaluate the advantages and the restrictions of the technique , a cadaveric study of supraclavicular and axillary approaches was conducted . \n we found that the axillary approach was useful and advantageous for lower roots , particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome ( tos ) . \n this report will focus on the evaluation of axillary robotic approach as the advantages and disadvantages of supraclavicular robotic intervention have been widely discussed in the literature . \n a human cadaver was subjected to this experiment in paris university ecole europenne de chirurgie anatomy laboratory and da vinci robot system was used . \n the left arm was tucked along the side and the right arm was placed in a semiflexed position extending toward the anesthesia location near the head , supported by foam and blankets ( figure 1 ) . \n a 6  cm long incision was made at the right axillar line , lateral to the edge of the pectoralis major muscle ( figure 2 ) . \n a self - retaining chung retractor was placed into the incision to elevate the pectoralis major muscle flap . \n the robot was docked as a camera ; right and left robotic arm were adapted in the incision area ( figure 3 ) . a 10  mm 0 downlooking scope , maryland forceps , and a curved scissors \n the working space was maintained with the self - retaining retractor , without co2 insufflation ( figure 4 ) . \n the subclavian artery was seen in front of the truncus and was positioned to the posterior of the working space . \n subclavian artery was dissected from the plexus and truncus of the lower plexus was exposed with blunt dissection . \n the plexus was exposed thoroughly from t1 to c7 levels . in this surgical setting , the operating surgeon , who has \n a wide experience in open brachial surgery of the brachial plexus , reported that lower brachial plexus exposure was easier from the axillary working area and a more wide range of motion was achieved to manipulate the robotic tools compared to the supraclavicular exposure for lower part of the brachial plexus . \n the development of robotic - assisted minimally invasive techniques began in urology , general surgery , and gynecology because of the generally large working spaces available in the abdomen for these types of surgeries [ 14 ] . \n since then , other surgeons have sought to use robotic devices in other areas , such as the brachial plexus [ 5 , 6 ] . \n brachial plexus dysfunction can be the result of shoulder trauma [ 7 , 8 ] . \n it can also occur with tos , which encompasses three separate disorders involving compression of the subclavian artery , subclavian vein , or brachial plexus in the triangular space bordered by the first rib , clavicle , and scalene muscles [ 9 , 10 ] . \n compression of the vessel - nerve package at the thoracic inlet has been treated with soft - tissue ( scalene muscle ) release and/or bone ( first rib ) resection . \n surgical approaches to first rib resection may be transthoracic , transaxillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , or thoracoscopic [ 9 , 10 ] . however , these approaches are typically associated with incomplete resection of the most medial portion of the first rib and neurovascular complications . \n theoretically , a minimally invasive transthoracic approach can obviate these problems , enabling complete resection of the offending portion of the first rib without neurovascular complication . \n , respectively , reported successful results of robotic en bloc first rib resection for tos treatment via transthoracic and transaxillary approaches [ 9 , 11 ] . \n 's techniques were only bony interventions and as being intrathoracic these need to be lung collapsed and lung complication can be waiting risk . \n although liverneaux et al . reported techniques and results of upper brachial plexus injury intervention via robotic surgery with a supraclavicular approach , they described the disadvantages as a narrow working space and difficulty to expose the c7 vertebra [ 1 , 5 , 12 ] . to our knowledge , this report is the first to objectively describe robotic axillar brachial plexus exposure . \n thus , we discuss the theoretical and clinical advantages and disadvantages of the axillary approach in the present report . \n the development of robot - assisted surgery has revealed new perspectives in peripheral nerve microsurgery . minimally invasive \n robot - assisted surgery could lead to modification of the classic algorithm for the treatment of traumatic brachial plexus lesions [ 6 , 8 ] . to date , exploration of these lesions has not been attempted less than 3 months after the traumatic event because clinical examination can not provide an accurate diagnosis or reliable prognosis in these first weeks . \n early intervention may enable initial assessment of the lesion and repair of potentially graftable nerve roots . \n several robotics properties are particularly adapted to microsurgery , such as high - resolution three - dimensional ( 3d ) visualization with up to 40 magnification , up to 10-fold magnification of surgical movements , elimination of physiological tremors , and the provision of ergonomic work conditions for otherwise uncomfortable surgery . \n robotic surgical systems allow high - definition magnified 3d visualization of the operative field , provide significant instrument maneuverability , even within a confined space , and may overcome the shortcomings of conventional approaches [ 2 , 5 ] . \n axillary ( infraclavicular ) brachial plexus intervention via robotic surgery has not been described previously . \n axillary intervention was previously performed as an open procedure to expose the plexus or resect the first rib for the treatment of tos . \n martinez et al . described first rib resection via robotic surgery but not to address plexus injury without transthoracic exposure , a novel minimally invasive approach to the first rib from inside of the chest . \n in addition , gharagozloo et al . reported first rib resection via transthoracic robotic surgery for paget - schroetter disease . \n 's techniques were considered more useful for lower brachial plexus viewing and assessing according to gharagozloo et al . \n the experience of the whole surgical team with robotic technology is important for the procedure . during learning curve period , \n two staff surgeons are required to participate in all procedures to ensure the safety of the program [ 5 , 9 ] . \n martinez et al . reported importance of the learning curve , not only for the surgeon but also for the entire surgical team and 180 minutes for the initial 10 cases . \n reported exclusion criteria include a history of previous incision in the same area and obesity , which present difficulties in robotic surgery initiation . \n other drawbacks of this new surgical approach are the increased cost of surgical equipment and longer operating time , especially during the learning curve period . \n however , we believe that the avoidance of a classic incision leads to significant patient satisfaction for cosmetic reasons and we believe that demand for this procedure from a select group of patients justifies the exploration of alternative ways to avoid classic brachial plexus exposure . \n this report presents our initial experience with robot - assisted axillary exposure of the brachial plexus region . in our opinion \n robotic surgery will be used routinely in the future for brachial plexus surgery and particularly for tos that is caused by bone and/or soft tissue . however , newer dedicated surgical instruments need to be developed and further studies should be conducted to evaluate in vivo application and results of this novel approach .",
         "brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . \n although the supraclavicular approach is a well known described and used procedure for robotic surgery , axillary approach was unknown for brachial plexus surgery . \n a cadaveric study was planned to evaluate the robotic axillary approach for brachial plexus surgery . \n our results showed that robotic surgery is a very useful method and should be used routinely for brachial plexus surgery and particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome . \n however , we emphasize that new instruments should be designed and further studies are needed to evaluate in vivo results .",

         "older people have particular spiritual needs that are distinct from those of others , particularly in times of ill health and death and dying . \n it has been reported that spirituality has a positive effect on health outcomes and welfare of the elderly . \n nowadays , aging phenomenon and relevant problems with its complexities are important issues that have attracted the attention of social and medical scientists to investigate the spiritual needs of the elderly . \n spiritual health is a dimension of health that is portrayed as the validation of life in relation to god , fellow human beings , and the environment . \n spirituality is the representative of the basic values that guide a person in searching to find answers to the crucial questions of life , such as the purpose and meaning of life , reality , love , good and bad , disease , and death .   over the past three decades , spirituality , religion , and prayer \n have turned into a subject of large interest for researchers in medicine , nursing , gerontology , physical health and mental health disciplines , often in conjunction with complementary and alternative medicine . \n this tendency has been stimulated by research demonstrating physical and psychological benefits of spiritual and religious involvements . \n in fact , approximately 96% of adults in the united states expressed their belief in god , and 72% of identified religion and spirituality as having the most important influence in their lives . saying prayers is a regular daily task for muslims which begins at the age of puberty and continues throughout the life . \n it is a time getting rid of the material world and approaching the world beyond , as well as , to the inner self . in iran , elderly people are more religious than younger ones , and this is a norm of this culture . \n a recent national survey of the iranians values and attitudes found that over 80% of the iranians practice prayer regularly as a part of their religion . \n one might argue that this is a true reflection of individual culture where prayer and religious beliefs are a part of people 's everyday life . \n however , prayer can go beyond just performing a religious duty , and based on one 's wishes , take different forms of formal and informal practices . \n it has been shown that disease prevalence , incidence and mortality rates differ from one population to another . \n this is partly ascribed to their disparities in lifestyle , dietary habits and other characteristics that are somehow affected by culture , especially religious traditions and experiences .   during the past two decades \n some studies have been carried out and the associations between religious beliefs or experiences and various types of physical illnesses , mental health , and mortality have been examined . \n spirituality is viewed as personally important matter to the older people and it has been proved that it is highly related to older people 's health outcomes . \n however , there has not been adequate experiential research on the relationship between religious or spiritual factors and healthy lifestyle behaviors , and their impact on the adult 's well - being . \n scientists believe that probing the effects of religious and spiritual factors as well as healthy lifestyle behaviors may be decisive . \n additionally , social science and medical research have concurrently reported that older adults are more inclined to take spiritual chase than younger people are . \n kotrotsiou - barboutal et al.(2006 ) indicated that older adults are remaining members of religious associations without necessarily participating regularly in services , as there are numerous issues that can diminish the active participation in religious events , such as transportation intricacies , bad sound , or the illegibility of small font text in books of prayers available at mosques or religious centers . in spite of those complexities , \n many elderly manage to find out a way to come up to god through prayer . \n it is stated that prayer increases the feelings of personal value of an elderly by reducing the feelings of loneliness and desertation , while television and radio provide support for spiritual life .   in this regard , researchers have shown that some groups of elderly people with inadequate and difficult livelihood situations communicate their problems by putting their trust in god . moreover , more than half of the elder patients practiced spiritual needs throughout their hospitalization period , with the most prominent need of being in the search of the meaning of life . \n extensive epidemiological studies have shown that higher levels of religiousness are related to lower mortality rates . \n studies identified the multidimensional nature of religiousness and spirituality and investigated various religious dimensions , for instance private religious behaviors , devotion , spiritual transcendence , and religious adaptation . \n for example , it was indicated that some aspects of religiousness predicted lower rates of disability and illness , alcoholism , cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and myocardial infarction . \n furthermore , clinical research has suggested that spirituality can play a vital role in the recovery of patients suffering from physical and psychological diseases . \n it seems that religious obligation has a crucial role in averting physical and mental diseases , recovery promotion , and disease adaptation . \n numerous studies have revealed the positive involvement of spirituality and religious indexes on different aspects of health such as cardiac surgery , mortality , immunity system function and self esteem . \n above all , religious involvement can be useful for psychological well - being and physical health . \n additionally , supporting the effect of spirituality may become more and more prominent in later life as a result of declining health , social and financial sources . \n researchers have proposed numerous psychological , social , and physiological interveners that may explain the spirituality - health association . \n quantitative measurements and the evaluation of spiritual beliefs are difficult because quantitative studies neither reveal the content , components of the beliefs , and its factors , nor the contexts that might be included . therefore , implementing qualitative research that explores the personal and experiential aspects of beliefs seems crucial , and may shed light on a range of important issues which can be investigated in detail on larger samples by further quantitative studies in future . \n spiritual or religious beliefs may affect the decisions of individuals that make about their health and illness . \n thus , recognizing and understanding the spiritual and religious behaviors within the context of cultural influence by a qualitative research is critical for nurse and other health - care providers . \n the main strengths of the present study are that it focuses on the spiritual life of healthy elderly people . \n therefore , the present study aimed to explore the concept of spirituality from the perspectives of iranian healthy elderly people . the central question of the paper was  what characterizes the spirituality in the iranian healthy older people ? \n in this research , a qualitative approach was adopted using conventional content analysis of unstructured interviews carried out with 17 healthy elderly people in tehran in 2010 - 2011 . \n it is worth noting that spirituality is underpinned by personal and cultural context in any community ; therefore , qualitative research is the best method to study cultural context - bound subjects . \n initially purposeful sampling was used and continued with purposeful sampling according to the codes and categories emerged from data . \n the study consisted of 17 healthy elders within the age range of 65 - 86 . \n criteria for selection were having age above 65 , living with family , not having any cognitive problems , not having any physical limitation in adl , and willingness to participate in the study . \n all participants were shia muslims . in order to achieve the wide range of experiences and perceptions of elderly participants , some field notes writing and 21 interviews were conducted according to emerged codes and categories from data . the first researcher communicated with each of the participants to describe the purpose of research and research questions . \n based on the participants preference , the interviews were performed in a private room at the house of elderly , park , worksite , or mosque , using an individual semi - structured interview format and this was primarily the main method for data collection . \n interview query consisted of open - ended questions to allow respondents thoroughly to describe their opinions , perceptions , and experiences . \n the participants were asked to describe one day of their life and then to explain their own experiences and perceptions about  spirituality in elderly adults  . \n what is your experience concerning the spirituality in later age? and  what is the meaning of spirituality in your experience ? \n each interview was transcribed verbatim and analyzed before the next interview was done , so that each interview supplied bearing for the next . \n coding was carried out line by line , and comparative analysis of the quotations was carried out . \n all interviews were conducted in a single session , at the request and preference of participants , except for two cases that took two sessions . \n each interview session ranged from 30 minutes to 90 minute with an average of 55 minutes . \n data were collected and analyzed over a six - month -- period in 2009 . in the first phase , subcategories and their domains in the data were identified and classified into categories . \n the coding process was iterative , and categories evolved ( inserted , deleted and combined ) as re - readings were completed and analyses progressed . in the second phase , the subcategories and domains were regrouped into major categories . \n credibility was recognized through prolonged engagement with the participants , field note writing , the participants revisions using member checking procedure , and peer checking . \n the findings and explanations of this study were reviewed by two supervisors who were associate professors in nursing having a good background in qualitative research methodology . also , maximum variation of sampling established the conformability and credibility of the data . \n this study provided sufficient descriptive data for researchers to criticize whether the findings were transferable that established applicability . \n permission to conduct this study was obtained from the ethics committee of tarbiat modares university . \n other ethical issues in this study included the assurance of confidentiality and anonymity of the participants and their responses . \n all participants were aware of the purpose of the study , and their participation in the study was optional . \n informed consent form was obtained from the participants who agreed to participate in the study according to the provisions of the declaration of helsinki . \n in this research , a qualitative approach was adopted using conventional content analysis of unstructured interviews carried out with 17 healthy elderly people in tehran in 2010 -

86 . \n also , 15 out of 21 were married , four were widowed , and one was single . \n five participants were illiterate , four were primary degree holders , eight had a diploma , two had bachelor degrees , and two had msc degree in human sciences . in terms of their occupation status , two were employees , 13 were pensioners , two was manual worker , and three were housewives . \n three main categories emerged from the data and 3 - 4 distinctive subcategories within each category were identified . \n these categories and their subcategories represent the main factors influencing the spirituality in iranian elderly people . \n main categories and subcategories one of the main categories that emerged from data analysis was  spiritual health  . four subcategories ; \n saying prayer as a calming factor  ,  beneficence as a way to god  ,  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , and  faith , a way to happiness  , emerged from the participants experiences . \n also many of the participants considered the prayer time as an opportunity for purification which made them more tolerant to the adversities and has a calming effect on them . \n i want to say that waking up early in the morning , having the spirit for things like prayer , citing quran verses , thanking god for his blessings and doing exercise would make you quiet and happy until the end of the day  . \n ( male ) most participants believed that dealing with the affairs of the elderly and giving them a helping hand in their lives have positive consequences for the servers . \n they also believed that doing good things to older adults will lead them to pray for the servers which in turn cause good things in the servers lives . \n they said that man would receive god 's blessings as a consequence of his / her deeds in the world . \n additionally , they believed that the ultimate consequence of good deeds was good in return . \n if she asks me to fix her air conditioner you can be sure that i ll do it . \n this is because i think that by doing this i make her happy and she prays for me . \n , the participants said that in iran the elderly people feel psychologically and spiritually alone and they do not receive any institutionally based mental and spiritual support . \n when i think about my life , i feel that i do n't have any support from my children . \n also in the street and road we do n't have appropriate social respect and i want to say that in our society there is limited support and backing for people like me . \n ( female ) the elderly participants lived experiences disclosed the subcategory of  faith , a way to happiness  in life . \n one of participants described that having strong faith was very important over the elderly life and adopting a healthy life style depended mostly on their faith and beliefs . \n also , they stressed that faith will lead them to a sense of physical and mental welfare and happiness . \n the one who has strong faith and beliefs is always happy and confident . in my opinion \n worshiping god , praying , fasting , reciting quran , purity and attending mosques are important elements in life , and bring happiness to your life and set your soul free  . \n ( male )  spiritual beliefs  was a main category that emerged from the participants lived experiences of spiritual concept and this category was further subcategorized into three subcategories including  seeking help from god in difficulties \n doing good deeds is the god 's will  . regarding the subcategory of  seeking help from god in difficulties \n , the participants believed that wishing for and seeking help from god can help the elderly people to deal better with life difficulties , disperses and stresses . \n this desire results in god 's attention to elderly and also creates sense of trust in older adults . \n some statements said by participants are :  i really believe in having trust in god . when i m trapped in a complicated situation \n , i believe that this is god who helps me and i only trust in god .  ( male ) one participant believed that spirituality was a vital component of older people lives . \n also , he believed that god was the ultimate source to affect my life or death and he controls everything . \n we re all waiting to see when the angel of death arrives and takes us away . \n ( male ) concerning the subcategory of  doing good deeds is the god 's will  , the participants believed that trust in god guided them to many positive activities in their lives . \n they believed that calling the name of god while getting out of house , remembering him throughout the daytime and praying will lead them to prosperity . \n one participant said that trust in god , submitting to god 's will and thinking about god all the time helped him to work and deal with anybody without any behavioral problems . \n when i want to get out of my house for work , e first thing that comes to mind is that \n my dear god : bestow upon me everything which is good for me and while i m out working , i do my best not to misbehave or do anything bad to anybody .  ( male ) another most important category that emerged was religious practice with three distinctive subcategories including : saying prayers , reciting quran , and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage . \n the majority of the participants indicated that they had good knowledge of quran , said prayers regularly , and went to mosque for religious and social activities . \n for example one participant said that participating in religious settings and ceremonies led her to find new friends and got her out of loneliness . \n we go to quran classes on friday mornings also.(male )  i have so much interest for pilgrimage and saying daily payers at the earliest recommended time when call for prayer is announced . \n i go to the religious rites with the my friends and peers , and i want to get out of loneliness . \n ( female ) thus , it can be concluded that all of the participants rose early to start their religious acts of devotion , prayers , and worship in their home or mosque . \n one of the main categories that emerged from data analysis was  spiritual health  . \n four subcategories ;  saying prayer as a calming factor  ,  beneficence as a way to god  ,  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , and  faith , a way to happiness  , emerged from the participants experiences . \n also many of the participants considered the prayer time as an opportunity for purification which made them more tolerant to the adversities and has a calming effect on them . \n i want to say that waking up early in the morning , having the spirit for things like prayer , citing quran verses , thanking god for his blessings and doing exercise would make you quiet and happy until the end of the day  . \n ( male ) most participants believed that dealing with the affairs of the elderly and giving them a helping hand in their lives have positive consequences for the servers . \n they also believed that doing good things to older adults will lead them to pray for the servers which in turn cause good things in the servers lives . \n they said that man would receive god 's blessings as a consequence of his / her deeds in the world . \n additionally , they believed that the ultimate consequence of good deeds was good in return . \n if she asks me to fix her air conditioner you can be sure that i ll do it . \n this is because i think that by doing this i make her happy and she prays for me . \n ( female ) moreover regarding  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , the participants said that in iran the elderly people feel psychologically and spiritually alone and they do not receive any institutionally based mental and spiritual support . \n when i think about my life , i feel that i do n't have any support from my children . \n also in the street and road we do n't have appropriate social respect and i want to say that in our society there is limited support and backing for people like me . \n ( female ) the elderly participants lived experiences disclosed the subcategory of  faith , a way to happiness  in life . \n one of participants described that having strong faith was very important over the elderly life and adopting a healthy life style depended mostly on their faith and beliefs . \n also , they stressed that faith will lead them to a sense of physical and mental welfare and happiness . \n the one who has strong faith and beliefs is always happy and confident . in my opinion \n worshiping god , praying , fasting , reciting quran , purity and attending mosques are important elements in life , and bring happiness to your life and set your soul free  . \n spiritual beliefs  was a main category that emerged from the participants lived experiences of spiritual concept and this category was further subcategorized into three subcategories including  seeking help from god in difficulties  ,  only god 's power over life and death  , and \n doing good deeds is the god 's will  . regarding the subcategory of  seeking help from god in difficulties  , the participants believed \n that wishing for and seeking help from god can help the elderly people to deal better with life difficulties , disperses and stresses . \n this desire results in god 's attention to elderly and also creates sense of trust in older adults . \n some statements said by participants are :  i really believe in having trust in god . when i m trapped in a complicated situation \n , i believe that this is god who helps me and i only trust in god .  ( male ) one participant believed that spirituality was a vital component of older people lives . \n also , he believed that god was the ultimate source to affect my life or death and he controls everything . \n we re all waiting to see when the angel of death arrives and takes us away . \n ( male ) concerning the subcategory of  doing good deeds is the god 's will  , the participants believed that trust in god guided them to many positive activities in their lives . \n they believed that calling the name of god while getting out of house , remembering him throughout the daytime and praying will lead them to prosperity . \n one participant said that trust in god , submitting to god 's will and thinking about god all the time helped him to work and deal with anybody without any behavioral problems . \n when i want to get out of my house for work , e first thing that comes to mind is that \n my dear god : bestow upon me everything which is good for me and while i m out working , i do my best not to misbehave or do anything bad to anybody .  ( male ) \n another most important category that emerged was religious practice with three distinctive subcategories including : saying prayers , reciting quran , and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage . \n the majority of the participants indicated that they had good knowledge of quran , said prayers regularly , and went to mosque for religious and social activities . \n for example one participant said that participating in religious settings and ceremonies led her to find new friends and got her out of loneliness . \n we go to quran classes on friday mornings also.(male )  i have so much interest for pilgrimage and saying daily payers at the earliest recommended time when call for prayer is announced . \n i go to the religious rites with the my friends and peers , and i want to get out of loneliness . \n ( female ) thus , it can be concluded that all of the participants rose early to start their religious acts of devotion , prayers , and worship in their home or mosque . \n this qualitative study describes the concept of spirituality and its impression on iranian elderly people daily living behaviors . \n the findings are significant as they reveal that the living experiences of saying prayer as a calming factor , beneficence as a way to god , loss of psychological and spiritual support , and faith , a way to happiness , are the most important domain and subcategory of spiritual health of elderly people , which can positively affect their health . on the other hand spiritual health \n is an important dimension of human health and it can determine the individual integrity . also spiritual health is a power that coordinates physical , mental and social dimensions and is necessary in coping with diseases . when spiritual health will is at serious risk , individuals may be stricken by mental disorders such as loneliness , depression , and loss of meaning . \n there are a number of studies that support the beneficial effects of spirituality on health . \n behaviors such as reliance on god , pilgrimage and praying create hope and positive attitudes that lead to internal serenity , peacefulness and meaningful life . \n most faithful people describe their relationship with god as a relationship with an intimate friend and believe that they can control the effect of irrepressible situations by having recourse to god . \n all in all , religious adaptation relies on beliefs and religious activities and help people to control their stress and physical disorders . having meaning and goal in life , sense of belonging to a sublime source , hope for gods support in time of trouble and social and spiritual support are among the sources that help religious people to suffer less from hardships of life . in the iranian society context , where the majority of the population are muslim , and \n a religious culture is dominant in the society , it is expected that tendency to spirituality could be affect their health . \n praying is the expression of soul and a deep human instinct that arises from human soul and is uttered with profound words . \n it is neither dependent upon any particular spirituality nor entailed in any time and place . \n the content of praying includes confession of sins and weakness , pleading for forgiveness , bliss and closeness to god . \n praying reduces mental and psychological pains , releases personal emotions , leading individual to attain eternal source of power . \n weeping that often comes with praying greatly helps a person to release his or her distress and emotions . \n also prayer helped participants to cope with disease and gave them calm , hope and inner strength . \n in this regard , quran has put it magnificently :  those who have faith in god and inundate their hearts with name of god , surely god remembrance ascertains their hearts  ( ( quran , chapter 13 : sureh 13 , al - rad ) verse 28 ) . \n many americans , regardless of their health status , rely on their religious and spiritual beliefs to cope with stressful life events . \n the present study has demonstrated that one of the most important factors that help elderly in confronting with difficulties was seeking help from god . \n several studies noted that spirituals beliefs had positive influence on welfare and personal and social life of elderly people . \n effective spiritual coping strategies help individuals find meaning and purpose in their life , problems and difficulties . for instance \n , one study showed that healthy older adults believed that a higher power supports them and that having a relationship with god forms a foundation for their psychological well - being . \n thus , spirituality plays an important role in the lives of healthy individuals , too . \n believing in support from spiritual / religious resource and connectedness with a higher power is beneficial and it can affect issues of control , quality of life , spiritual well - being , coping , depression , decision - making , and possibly health outcomes . \n for instance , it has been reported that healthy older adults believe that a higher power supports them and that having a relationship with god forms a foundation for their psychological well - being . \n thus , spirituality plays an important role in the lives of healthy individuals . in the result of our study \n a sense of god 's power over life and death and doing good deeds is the god 's will were derived from participants experience around spiritual beliefs . \n all the participants talked about the importance of god and belief to god 's power in their life . \n moreover , the findings reveal that god 's power was very important in personal and private experiences . in this regard , roff et al.(2009 ) in a qualitative study through a thematic content analysis identified god 's power in the lived experiences of women who were suffering from breast cancer . also , in another qualitative study by taleghani et al . \n ( 2006 ) belief to god 's will was a important key in acceptance of disease . \n 2002 ) suggested that personal variables such as the concept of god and perception of others beliefs played important mediating roles in religious coping with stress situations . \n religious practices were a subcategory that emerged from the lived experiences of elderly participants in this research . furthermore , the results of study by keefe et al . \n ( 2001 ) showed that individuals who reported frequent daily spiritual experiences had higher levels of positive mood , lower levels of daily negative mood , and higher levels of all of the social support domains . \n another subcategory that emerged from participants experience was going to mosque and religious ceremonies . in this regard , palinkas ( 1982 ) found that religious ceremonies are supportive for individuals because liberating and curative friendships relevant to spiritual states brings about psychological health for them . attending religious ceremonies and shrines also reduces individuals anxieties and sense of loneliness . \n these results are in accordance with our study findings which show that elderly women who participate in religious ceremonies , are relieved from loneliness . also koenig ( 1998 ) \n suggested that religious practices , attitudes and coping behaviors are prevalent among hospitalized medically ill older adults and are related to social , psychological and physical health outcomes . \n morris ( 1983 ) examined the relationship between anxiety and pilgrimage and found that people with religious devotion experienced significantly lower rates of anxiety disorder compared to the non - religious group . \n every muslim learns their prayers from a young age and prays five times a day . \n in addition , those who seek guidance from the holy quran and believe that it has power over every aspect of their lives , expect and welcome any eventualities in their lives ( quran , chapter balad , verse 4 ) . \n it seems that elderly people have more tendencies to religious and spiritual subjects than young people . \n koenig et al . ( 2004 ) in his study showed spirituality and religion as an important factor in their lives more often than younger ones . \n several experimental studies have been conducted that showed positive effects of prayer on the management of physical symptoms of illness . \n kwilecki ( 1986 ) assessed the effect of prayer on stress and anxiety and found that 42% of participants report that saying prayer can diminish the stress and anxiety . also salehi ( 2001 ) found that individuals who pray regularly , experienced significantly lower rates of anxiety disorder and depression , psychological balance and hopefulness , compared to the non - prayer group . \n azizi ( 1996 ) found that more than 90% of prayers attained psychological tranquility and relaxation after saying prayer . \n several studies noted moderately positive correlations between indicators of physical health and prayer activities . also several studies have shown that prayer can play an important role in the recovery of patients who suffer from cardiac disease , hiv , arthritis rheumatoid , and cva attack , cancer cases , treatment of addiction , and physical , mental and social well - being . \n furthermore , evidence suggests that patients with strong religious beliefs and high levels of religious activity experience lower levels of pain , have better immune function , lower death rates from cancer , fewer incidences of heart disease , lower blood pressure and levels of cholesterol , better health behaviors , and greater compliance with medical treatment . \n the practical relevance of this study may conduct future work to further explicate and clarify the linkages between spirituality and physical and mental health and life style . \n future empirical research and new methods of investigation such as concept analysis , grounded theory , and action research are needed to develop the new models of caring for management of this group . in the life style area , \n future research should focus on the effects of spirituality on elderly people lifestyle domains and on the development of valid and reliable instruments to measure these effects . \n it is important to conduct such research in different samples , such as unhealthy elderly people ( frail , ill , and sick elderly people ) . \n future empirical research and new methods of investigation such as concept analysis , grounded theory , and action research are needed to develop the new models of caring for management of this group . in the life style area , \n future research should focus on the effects of spirituality on elderly people lifestyle domains and on the development of valid and reliable instruments to measure these effects . \n it is important to conduct such research in different samples , such as unhealthy elderly people ( frail , ill , and sick elderly people ) . \n in summary , we found that elderly people describe several elements in their illustration of spirituality in healthcare settings . \n spiritual health , spiritual beliefs , and religious practice intentionality were the main components of concept of spirituality in this group experiences . \n also , the findings of this study made it clear that spirituality has a considerable effect on the health and life of iranian elderly people and is a major supportive resource for their physical and psychosocial health . \n it can reduce mental distress and induce inner peace and hopefulness . because of the significant influence of spirituality on all domains of health of elderly people , it is critically important that health care providers understand how spirituality can considerably influence elderly people throughout their life . \n these findings will assist health professionals such as nurses , physicians , and social workers to recognize the spiritual needs and value the role of spirituality in promoting health and well - being among elderly people from different religions and cultures worldwide .",
         "background : spirituality is recognized as a personally important matter to the elderly , and there are evidences of its impact on their health . \n the aim of this study was to explore the concept of spirituality from the perspectives of iranian healthy elderly individuals.materials and methods : a conventional qualitative content analysis of carried out with 21 healthy elderly people from both male and female genders were chosen using a purposive sampling method in tehran in 2010 - 2011 . \n data collection was done through semi structured interviews . \n a qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the participants experiences and perceptions on spirituality , using a central question  what characterizes the spirituality in the iranian healthy elderly people?results : the following categories emerged from the data analysis : ( 1 ) spiritual health , with four sub categories including saying prayer as a calming factor ; beneficence as a way to god ; loss of psychological and spiritual support ; faith as a way to happiness ; ( 2 ) spiritual beliefs , with three sub categories including seeking help from god in difficulties ; god 's power over life and death ; doing good deeds is the god 's will ; and ( 3 ) religious practice with three sub categories including saying prayer ; reading quran ; and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage.conclusions:in this study was found that spirituality was a fundamental element in elderly individuals lives that help them to adapt with daily living conditions .",

colored urine , so he was transferred to our institution . upon physical examination , \n the laboratory tests showed elevated creatine kinase level ( 1 778 856 u / l ; normal range 20 - 200 \n u / l ) , elevated serum transaminases ( serum glutamic - pyruvic transaminase [ sgpt ] = 1857 \n u / l [ normal range 0 - 50 u / l ] , serum glutamic - oxaloacetic transaminase [ sgot ] = 8626 u / l [ normal range 0 - 50 u / l ] ) , and creatinine 0.72 mg / dl ( 0.3 -

up examination 1 month after discharge , revealing that the child was able to walk normally with positive deep tendon reflex . \n two months after discharge , the creatine kinase level dropped to 193 iu / l . \n rhabdomyolysis results from skeletal muscle breakdown due to various causes . viral myositis , trauma , and inherited disorders are the most common causes in the pediatric age group . \n the breakdown releases the normal cell contents into the bloodstream , including creatine kinase , myoglobin , phosphorus , and potassium . \n rhabdomyolysis is suspected clinically when muscle aches , muscle weakness , and tea - colored urine are present . \n the diagnosis is based on the high creatine kinase level , which is the most sensitive marker . although there is no established cutoff levels , a concentration 5 to 10 times higher than the upper limit of normal reference range ( ie , 500 -

barre syndrome or other underlying immune - mediated diseases , neither the creatine kinase level decline nor the clinical status improvement was affected by the intravenous immunoglobulin administration . the sharp decline in the creatine kinase level \n there are no clues in the family history or the patient s personal history that may suggest an underlying inherited metabolic , muscular , or genetic disease . \n , this could be the first presentation of lipin-1 mutation that causes recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children . \n lipin-1 gene encodes the muscle - specific phosphatidic acid phosphatase , a key enzyme in triglyceride and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis . \n the episodes of rhabdomyolysis are mostly triggered by intercurrent infections and fever and to a lesser extent by fasting or exercise . \n the prognosis of lipin-1 deficiency is poor , with up to one -

term storage containers ( ibp ; indian oil corporation limited , nasik , india ) . \n on the day of surgery , the tissue was transported from the cryobank to the hospital in a liquid nitrogen container . \n the vials containing frozen tissue were gradually thawed by rubbing them between the palms or keeping them at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes until the frozen medium inside the vial was liquefied . \n the lenticule was then transferred into a petri dish and washed twice with balanced salt solution for 5 minutes each to remove the cryoprotectant agents . \n a visumax fs laser was used to create a 7.5 mm diameter pocket at a depth of 160 m and 4 mm superior incision . \n the incision was opened with a seibel spatula and the plane of the pocket was dissected . \n the cryopreserved lenticule ( which was matched for the refractive error after correcting for back vertex distance ) was placed on the patient 's cornea with its center marked with gentian violet dye . \n the lenticule was held with 2 forceps and inserted into the pocket . after insertion , \n the lenticule was spread out , and the center was aligned with the pupillary center . \n a depth of 160 m was chosen for implantation in all patients due to uncertainty in refractive outcomes , the novelty of the nomograms , and so the surgeon could have adequate tissue in the cap for later enhancement with surface ablation if required . \n postoperatively , a topical steroid ( 1% prednisolone acetate ; allergan , irvine , ca ) was prescribed for 3 months in a tapering dosage . \n in addition , 5% hypertonic saline drops ( hypersol-5 ; jawa pharmaceuticals , india ) were prescribed 6 times per day for 1 week to reduce endothelial stress and to aid in lenticule clearing . \n patients were examined postoperatively on days 1 and 15 and at 1 , 3 , and 6 months . \n a slit - lamp examination was performed to check for lenticule clarity , position , and wound healing . \n postoperative corneal haze and folds were graded at every follow - up time point using the scale described by nakamura et al and the corneal folds grading atlas.12,13 on postoperative day 15 and onward , the following assessments were performed : uncorrected visual acuity , best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) , retinoscopy for residual refractive error , topography using orbscan(bausch & lomb - technolas , munchen , germany ) and sirius ( schwind eye - tech solutions , kleinostheim , germany ) , anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( optovue , fremont , ca ) , clinical photography , specular microscopy ( tomey , japan ) , dry eye assessment ( schirmer 's i ) , and aberrometry ( itrace ; tracey technologies , houston , tx ) . \n table 2 provides the details of donors and lenticules used for fili in the 9 eyes treated . \n demographic details of patients who underwent fili ( 7 patients , 9 eyes ) details of donors and lenticules used for fili ( n = 9 ) on day 1 , in the first 2 consecutive eyes , the implanted lenticules had mild to moderate descemet membrane folds that resolved spontaneously within 1 week . \n subsequently , the treated eyes were prescribed hypertonic saline drops , which showed clear lenticules within 48 hours and until the last follow - up time point . \n figure 2 shows serial clinical photographs and anterior segment optical coherence tomography of the eye treated with fili at day 15 and at 6 months post - fili showing clear lenticules with good centration . \n a , serial digital clinical photographs ( 16 ) of 32-year - old woman operated for + 6.5 d hyperopia in the right eye with fili . \n distance from edge of the lenticule to limbus was measured at 3 points and verified at every visit to check for centering and any shift in position . \n b , six - month postoperative anterior segment optical coherence tomography of an eye treated for + 6.5 d hyperopia showing a clear and well - centered lenticule . \n all eyes had an uncorrected visual acuity equal to or better than the preoperative bcva . \n the refractive predictability for hyperopia was fairly accurate , and all eyes had a residual spherical equivalent within 1.0 diopter ( d ) , although in the aphakic eye , the residual spherical equivalent was + 4.1 d. there was an average of 0.75 to 1.00 d against - the - rule astigmatism in all eyes due to the superior 4 mm incision , which reduced and stabilized over time . \n postoperative results of eyes treated with fili ( n = 9 ) table 4 provides changes in anterior and posterior curvature , pachymetry and asphericity ( q value ) following fili . \n all eyes had central corneal steepening with a mean change in anterior keratometry of 3.5 d in the central 3-mm zone . \n there was an average 0.33 d flattening of posterior corneal curvature in all eyes , which was seen more in thicker lenticules compared with the thinner ones . \n figure 3 illustrates changes in anterior and posterior curvature post - fili in an eye , over time . \n changes in anterior and posterior topography , pachymetry , and asphericity post - fili ( n = 9 ) orbscan anterior corneal surface topography ( top ) and sirius posterior elevation ( bottom ) over the 6-month postoperative course after fili for eye with + 6.5 d hyperopia . \n the postoperative q values in all eyes became more negative , suggesting a hyperprolate shift . \n table 5 provides analysis of the epithelial thickness profile , which suggested mild epithelial thinning in the 5-mm zone in all hyperopic eyes , except for the aphakic eye , which showed mild epithelial thickening in the corresponding zone . \n figure 4 illustrates the epithelial thickness map of an eye treated with fili at 6 months . \n epithelial thickness profile on anterior segment optical coherence tomography in the central 5-mm zone epithelial thickness profile with anterior segment optical coherence tomography of an eye 6 months post - fili for + 6.5 d hyperopia . \n higher order aberrations ( hoa ) did not show a significant increase in root mean square values postoperatively in the 8 hyperopic eyes ( p > 0.05 ) . \n endothelial cell count and schirmer i test scores were normal and the changes were not significant at the last follow - up ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 6 ) . \n total hoas at 5-mm pupil size ( n = 8) , ecd , and schirmer 's i scores , pre- and post - fili ( n = 9 ) \n the potential advantages of cryopreservation of refractive lenticules have been largely described for use in the same patient , in the event of future ectasia or presbyopia by restoring corneal volume.3 with the increasing number of eyes undergoing relex smile for myopia , and thus , the extracted lenticules as a by - product , it may be a novel idea to preserve these lenticules on a long - term basis using cryopreservation for potential future use and research . \n following establishment of one such tissue bank , we wanted to explore the possibility of use of such cryopreserved refractive lenticules for potential treatment of hyperopia and study the feasibility , safety , efficacy , and reproducibility of this new treatment . \n initially , the amblyopic eyes were studied mainly for changes in refraction and topography following tissue addition . \n there was also the goal of evaluating any loss of bcva and complications , such as haze and tissue rejection . \n even these patients benefited from the surgery , as their refractive error was corrected to their best spectacle - corrected visual acuity and reduced their dependence on eyeglasses . after reviewing the results for 6 months , the indications were extended to normal eyes and bilateral surgery . \n unlike myopia , the correction of hyperopia involves creation of a furrow - like ring zone in the paracentral zone of the cornea . \n both photorefractive keratectomy and lasik are subtractive procedures that steepen the cornea by ablating the midperipheral tissue.14,15 this creates an abnormal hyperprolate shape of the cornea that is associated with significant regression , especially in higher degrees of refractive errors.16 it potentially leads to the induction of hoas like coma and spherical aberrations and loss of bcva.17 fili is an innovative technique based on barraquer 's law of thickness,18 whereby the cornea is made steeper by addition of a lenticule of known thickness and power into a pocket created in a patient 's cornea using the fs laser . \n the concept is similar to epikeratophakia , used to treat aphakia in the past , which had its own disadvantages.19 a fs laser overcomes these problems by creating precise lenticules and incisions at an accurate depth . the lenticular tissue processing technique described by mohamed - noriega et al10 \n was modified in this study by replacing bovine serum albumin with human tissue culture media to eliminate the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases or unexpected adverse reactions due to bovine serum . \n the protocols of gradual staged thawing , which are essential for the whole cornea to prevent endothelial cell injury due to sudden thawing , were not strictly followed in this study . \n microbiological and cellular cultures were not deemed necessary , as the tissue processing and preservation were conducted under strict sterile conditions , and the tissue did not contain vital endothelial cells . also , previous studies have suggested that stromal keratocytes within the extracted lenticules remain viable and can be stimulated to proliferate in appropriate cell culture conditions , even after a prolonged period of cryopreservation.9,10 the change in asphericity after fili suggests an increase in the prolateness of the cornea , which is expected after tissue addition , although the observed change was not seen as much as it is after hyperopic lasik.20 the shape of the cornea is more natural after tissue addition compared with tissue subtraction , which does not lead to significant induction of hoas.21 the total hoas after fili remain within normal acceptable values and may be better than hyperopic lasik / photorefractive keratectomy.22,23 also , tissue addition may be more forgiving for mild decentration , which is not the case with hyperopic lasik \n . the rate of enhancement following hyperopic lasik can be up to 10% or more,24 especially in younger patients . \n after tissue addition , significant changes in topography or regression are not expected ; thus , retreatment rates may be lower . \n epithelial thickness profile is more favorable , which , unlike hyperopic lasik , does not cause midperipheral epithelial hyperplasia to compensate for loss of stromal tissue , hence reducing chances of regression.25 problems of haze and flap - related issues like delayed healing , infection , and dislocation are eliminated , thereby leading to greater patient comfort and faster recovery . \n a fairly good refractive predictability was observed with this technique in the treatment of moderate hyperopia , although results were not highly accurate for correcting very high hyperopia ( eg , aphakia ) . in a case study reported by pradhan \n et al,4 a 10 d lenticule was implanted to achieve correction of aphakia but had a high residual refraction of + 5 d. there are possible explanations for this result . \n first , the technique of pradhan et al of pocket creation was different from the technique used in this study . in the said study , \n a smile lenticule was first created , followed by dissection of the anterior plane to create a pocket , thus making 2 planes that could possibly cause weakening of the cornea . \n second , the optical zone of the lenticule in the study of pradhan et al was 5.7 mm compared with 6 mm in the current aphakia case , causing comparatively less volume of tissue addition . \n the correction is expected to be relatively higher in larger lenticules because there is more volume of the tissue added . in this hyperopic series , \n the lenticule size ranged from 6.3 to 6.8 mm . also , the posterior curvature changes as described in the case study of pradhan et al reduced the effect on anterior curvature . \n this was also probably the cause of the high + 4.1 d residual refraction in the current study . \n after compensation , implantation of lenticule of approximately 12.5 d is required , and this is currently not possible with visumax . \n the biomechanics of corneas in these patients were not studied due to lack of equipment such as the corvis ( oculus optikgerte gmbh , wetzlar , germany ) . however , because most of the bowman layer is preserved and tissue is being added , it is assumed that the biomechanics are more stable than lasik , where a flap is cut and tissue is subtracted from the periphery.26 the procedure certainly amounts to corneal transplantation and thus , theoretically carries the risk of future rejection . \n however , unlike traditional full thickness grafts , which have a graft  host junction proximal to host limbus , in this technique , the lenticule was well protected in the host corneal pocket and did not come in direct contact with the host 's limbal vasculature and immune system , making the risk of allogeneic graft rejection remotely possible.27 also , the lenticule was mainly stromal collagen tissue ; the incidence of rejection is significantly low in such a scenario compared with endothelial rejection . \n because no sutures are applied , there are no suture - related complications such as loosening , vascularization , or infection that would potentially trigger graft rejection.28 nevertheless , there is a need to monitor for signs of rejection and treat it like allogeneic graft rejection should rejection occur . \n because it is a reversible procedure , the lenticule can always be explanted in the event of any adverse effects or rejection in future . \n the preliminary results of fili in hyperopia indicate that this may be a better technique than hyperopic lasik for moderate hyperopia in terms of stability , regression , aberrations , and postoperative dry eye . \n although it is a bit early to exactly predict the refractive outcomes , initial data indicate that the cryopreservation technique used is safe in heterologous individuals . \n further studies with a larger cohort and modification of the surgical technique with a goal of reducing postoperative astigmatism and refining nomograms are suggested to determine the long - term safety and refractive effects on the cornea and establish the technique as a valid option to treat hyperopia .",
         "purpose : to describe the technique of cryopreservation of corneal lenticules extracted after small incision refractive lenticule extraction ( relex smile ) and initial results of femtosecond laser intrastromal lenticular implantation for hyperopia.methods:lenticules were collected from patients undergoing relex smile for the correction of myopia and subjected to a tissue processing technique and cryopreservation . \n these lenticules were subsequently used to treat 8 hyperopic eyes and 1 aphakic eye . \n a femtosecond laser was used to create a pocket into each patient 's cornea , followed by implantation of a cryopreserved lenticule . \n the patients were monitored through follow - up examinations for a mean 155.4 days ( 38310 days).results : the mean interval from storage of lenticules to removal from liquid nitrogen was 96 days ( range , 19178 days ) . \n mean spherical equivalent of hyperopic eyes treated was + 4.50  1.1 diopter ( d ) . \n mean keratometry and pachymetry changed from preoperative 43.9 d and 531.6 m to 47.4 d and 605.2 m , respectively , postoperatively . \n mean residual spherical equivalent for hyperopic eyes was + 0.6 d and + 4.1 d for the aphakic eye . \n none of the eyes showed evidence of rejection or loss of best - corrected visual acuity at the end of the follow - up period.conclusions:the cryopreservation technique seems to be a safe method of long - term storage of refractive lenticules extracted after relex smile for use in allogeneic human subjects . \n it may potentially be a safe and effective alternative to excimer laser ablation for hyperopia because of the low risks of regression , haze , flap - related complications , postoperative dry eye , and higher - order aberrations.clinical trial registration \n url : http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . \n unique identifier : ctri/2014/01/004331 .",

cyclists . \n the cyclists initiated all tt in the heat with a similar power output as maintained during the first 20% of ttc . \n however , while maintaining similar hr , they subsequently experienced a marked decrease in power output and speed in the heat . \n these decrements were progressively restored with heat acclimatization , despite core temperature in all tt in the heat increasing significantly more than that in cool conditions . \n our data showed that mean power output during tth-1 decreased by 16%  5% in unacclimatized cyclists . \n this decrement in power output for an increase in air temperature of approximately 28c between ttc and tth-1 represents an average decrement in performance of 0.5% per 1c increase . even if this decrement is not linear , as the effect of an absolute increase in air temperature is more important in warm than in cold environments ( 13 ) , this rate is comparable with the decrements reported during laboratory tt ( 0.3% to 0.9% per 1c ( 12,23,24,32 ) . \n in addition , the current study quantified the effects of heat stress on performance at different acclimatization stages . to date , most studies investigating the effects of heat on performance have examined unacclimatized participants . \n these have shown that artificial heat acclimatization increases the ability to cycle in a hot laboratory ( 18,21 ) and that natural heat acclimatization increases physical performance during sporting activities in hot environments ( 25,26,33 ) . \n however , a comparison of the magnitude of improvement in performance after heat acclimatization , relative to the initial decrement in performance associated with the first exposure to heat stress , has yet to be examined . \n our data showed that the decrement in cycling performance was progressively restored as the cyclists acclimatized . from an average power decrement of 16%  5% on the first day of heat exposure ( tth-1 ) \n relative to ttc , the decrement was reduced to 8%  4% after 1 wk of training in the heat ( tth-2 ) and to 3%  4% after 2 wk ( tth-3 ) . despite the cooling effect of air movement \n , our data showed that the average final temperature of the riders was above 40c during tth , irrespective of heat acclimatization ( table 1 ) . \n one rider complained of nausea after tth-1 but did not require medical attention and participated in the following training sessions and tests without any sequelae . despite an average final temperature of 40.2c ( range , 39.6c41.0c ) , \n this confirms that well - prepared athletes reach high core temperatures while exercising in the heat , asymptomatic of heat illness ( 4 ) , and that there is no absolute critical temperature threshold set at 40c ( 11 ) . in the current study , despite the decrease in power output ( fig . \n 1 ) and the possibility to drink ad libitum on the bike , participants lost more than 2% body mass and core temperature reached final values above 40c in the hot conditions ( fig . \n our data showed a decrement in absolute intensity ( i.e. , power output ) during the tt but the likely maintenance of a similar relative intensity . \n indeed , it has been shown that the rise in cardiovascular strain in hot conditions during both constant rate ( 1,36,37 ) and self - paced ( 24 ) exercise mediates a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity , resulting in an increase in relative intensity for a given absolute work rate . \n although power output decreases during prolonged self - paced exercise in the heat , it is proposed that a similar relative intensity to that of cool conditions is maintained and is reflected by a similar or slightly elevated hr ( 24 ) . \n it therefore seems that despite a decrease in power output , hr remained elevated and stable ( fig . \n moreover , the pacing pattern was not dependent on the environmental conditions or the acclimatization level , which is in line with recent reports that pacing strategies are not affected by environmental temperature ( 23 ) , thermal perception ( 2 ) , or the presence of previous muscle fatigue ( 6 ) . \n rather , it seems that pacing during a cycling tt in hot or temperate conditions relates to the maintenance of a physiological threshold or relative intensity ( manifested by hr ) . \n given the progressive reduction in vo2max as hyperthermia develops , sustainable power output is reduced , owing to a reduction in work rate for a given relative exercise intensity ( 24 ) . furthermore , it is remarkable that experienced cyclists started their tt at the same absolute intensity regardless of the environmental conditions or their level of heat acclimatization . \n notwithstanding , it has previously been reported that tt are initiated at the same power output in hot and cool conditions ( 11,24,31 ) . \n this similar work rate adopted seems to correspond to a critical power ( 16 ) . \n given that vo2max does not typically decrease in the first approximately 15 min of exercise in the heat ( 27,29,35 ) , athletes seem to adopt a relative intensity associated with this critical power output . as vo2max progressively decreases with the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain in the heat , the maintenance of a similar relative intensity requires reduction in power output ( 24 ) . \n however , given the role of previous experiences on pacing ( 30 ) , one would expect that the large decrease in power output experienced by the athletes during tth-1 would have led to a conservative start during tth-2 . \n initial power output was similar between trials and decreased thereafter in relation to acclimatization state . \n indeed , early studies suggest that heat acclimatization attenuates the circulatory strain associated with thermoregulation ( 19 ) , allowing normalization of the relation between physiological responses and work intensity ( 10 ) . \n consequently , the cyclists seem to have finished all tt at a similar relative intensity , as suggested by hr and the similar core temperatures recorded upon completion but at a higher power output as acclimatization progressed . of note , the slightly higher hr in tth may be attributable to higher skin blood flow , as suggested by the higher core temperature , although the cyclists were wearing thermal clothing in ttc , which would also have lead to increase in skin temperature and blood flow . \n the current study is the first to investigate cycling performance during outdoor tt in a hot environment . \n . however , the evaporative capacity of the environment is improved with higher air velocities , reducing heat stress and dehydration during outdoor cycling compared with indoor laboratory - based experiments ( 28 ) . in the current study , \n the cyclists wore thermal clothing in ttc including long tights , long sleeves , and gloves , which limited the evaporative and convective power of the environment , whereas they wore short tights and a jersey with short sleeves in the heat ( except one cyclist who was consistently using white long sleeves ) . \n therefore , it can not be ruled out that overall performance may be optimized in a slightly warmer temperature than in the ttc conditions of the current study . \n interestingly , the detrimental effect of hot ambient conditions on speed was not as important as that on power output ( table 1 ) . \n the different relations between the environment and speed and power output could be partly related to a temperature effect on air density , as the aerodynamic drag of a cyclist is related to air density and temperature ( 3,9,17 ) . for example , at an air temperature of 11c , the temperature reported to optimize laboratory cycling capacity ( 14 ) , air density is approximately 1.245 kgm at sea level . \n in contrast , air density drops to approximately 1.165 kgm at a temperature of 30c , reducing the drag force by approximately 6% . \n consequently , the decrease in air density noted in hot ambient conditions is likely to partially attenuate the performance decrement associated with development of hyperthermia during outdoor cycling . in the current study , \n air density was 9.4% lower during tth-3 ( 1.131 kgm ) than that during ttc ( 1.249 kgm ) , representing a power economy of almost 8% ( 22 ) . \n thus , despite the slightly lower power output in tth-3 than that in ttc ( 3% ) , the average speeds were not significantly different . \n our data showed that mean power output during tth-1 decreased by 16%  5% in unacclimatized cyclists . \n this decrement in power output

laboratory ( 18,21 ) and that natural heat acclimatization increases physical performance during sporting activities in hot environments ( 25,26,33 ) . \n however , a comparison of the magnitude of improvement in performance after heat acclimatization , relative to the initial decrement in performance associated with the first exposure to heat stress , has yet to be examined . \n our data showed that the decrement in cycling performance was progressively restored as the cyclists acclimatized . from an average power decrement of 16%  5% on the first day of heat exposure ( tth-1 ) \n relative to ttc , the decrement was reduced to 8%  4% after 1 wk of training in the heat ( tth-2 ) and to 3%  4% after 2 wk ( tth-3 ) . despite the cooling effect of air movement \n , our data showed that the average final temperature of the riders was above 40c during tth , irrespective of heat acclimatization ( table 1 ) . \n one rider complained of nausea after tth-1 but did not require medical attention and participated in the following training sessions and tests without any sequelae . despite an average final temperature of 40.2c ( range , 39.6c41.0c ) , \n this confirms that well - prepared athletes reach high core temperatures while exercising in the heat , asymptomatic of heat illness ( 4 ) , and that there is no absolute critical temperature threshold set at 40c ( 11 ) . in the current study , despite the decrease in power output ( fig . \n 1 ) and the possibility to drink ad libitum on the bike , participants lost more than 2% body mass and core temperature reached final values above 40c in the hot conditions ( fig . \n our data showed a decrement in absolute intensity ( i.e. , power output ) during the tt but the likely maintenance of a similar relative intensity . \n indeed , it has been shown that the rise in cardiovascular strain in hot conditions during both constant rate ( 1,36,37 ) and self - paced ( 24 ) exercise mediates a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity , resulting in an increase in relative intensity for a given absolute work rate . \n although power output decreases during prolonged self - paced exercise in the heat , it is proposed that a similar relative intensity to that of cool conditions is maintained and is reflected by a similar or slightly elevated hr ( 24 ) . \n it therefore seems that despite a decrease in power output , hr remained elevated and stable ( fig . \n moreover , the pacing pattern was not dependent on the environmental conditions or the acclimatization level , which is in line with recent reports that pacing strategies are not affected by environmental temperature ( 23 ) , thermal perception ( 2 ) , or the presence of previous muscle fatigue ( 6 ) . \n rather , it seems that pacing during a cycling tt in hot or temperate conditions relates to the maintenance of a physiological threshold or relative intensity ( manifested by hr ) . \n given the progressive reduction in vo2max as hyperthermia develops , sustainable power output is reduced , owing to a reduction in work rate for a given relative exercise intensity ( 24 ) . furthermore , it is remarkable that experienced cyclists started their tt at the same absolute intensity regardless of the environmental conditions or their level of heat acclimatization . \n notwithstanding , it has previously been reported that tt are initiated at the same power output in hot and cool conditions ( 11,24,31 ) . \n this similar work rate adopted seems to correspond to a critical power ( 16 ) . \n given that vo2max does not typically decrease in the first approximately 15 min of exercise in the heat ( 27,29,35 ) , athletes seem to adopt a relative intensity associated with this critical power output . as vo2max progressively decreases with the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain in the heat , the maintenance of a similar relative intensity requires reduction in power output ( 24 ) . \n however , given the role of previous experiences on pacing ( 30 ) , one would expect that the large decrease in power output experienced by the athletes during tth-1 would have led to a conservative start during tth-2 . \n initial power output was similar between trials and decreased thereafter in relation to acclimatization state . \n indeed , early studies suggest that heat acclimatization attenuates the circulatory strain associated with thermoregulation ( 19 ) , allowing normalization of the relation between physiological responses and work intensity ( 10 ) . \n consequently , the cyclists seem to have finished all tt at a similar relative intensity , as suggested by hr and the similar core temperatures recorded upon completion but at a higher power output as acclimatization progressed . of note , the slightly higher hr in tth may be attributable to higher skin blood flow , as suggested by the higher core temperature , although the cyclists were wearing thermal clothing in ttc , which would also have lead to increase in skin temperature and blood flow . \n the current study is the first to investigate cycling performance during outdoor tt in a hot environment . \n however , the evaporative capacity of the environment is improved with higher air velocities , reducing heat stress and dehydration during outdoor cycling compared with indoor laboratory - based experiments ( 28 ) . in the current study , \n the cyclists wore thermal clothing in ttc including long tights , long sleeves , and gloves , which limited the evaporative and convective power of the environment , whereas they wore short tights and a jersey with short sleeves in the heat ( except one cyclist who was consistently using white long sleeves ) . \n therefore , it can not be ruled out that overall performance may be optimized in a slightly warmer temperature than in the ttc conditions of the current study . \n interestingly , the detrimental effect of hot ambient conditions on speed was not as important as that on power output ( table 1 ) . \n the different relations between the environment and speed and power output could be partly related to a temperature effect on air density , as the aerodynamic drag of a cyclist is related to air density and temperature ( 3,9,17 ) . for example , at an air temperature of 11c , the temperature reported to optimize laboratory cycling capacity ( 14 ) , air density is approximately 1.245 kgm at sea level . \n in contrast , air density drops to approximately 1.165 kgm at a temperature of 30c , reducing the drag force by approximately 6% . \n consequently , the decrease in air density noted in hot ambient conditions is likely to partially attenuate the performance decrement associated with development of hyperthermia during outdoor cycling . in the current study , \n air density was 9.4% lower during tth-3 ( 1.131 kgm ) than that during ttc ( 1.249 kgm ) , representing a power economy of almost 8% ( 22 ) . \n thus , despite the slightly lower power output in tth-3 than that in ttc ( 3% ) , the average speeds were not significantly different . \n the novel findings of this investigation are that competitive cyclists performing an outdoor tt undertake their effort at the same power output , irrespective of the environmental conditions or previous experience . \n consequently , non  heat - acclimatized cyclists are incapable of sustaining this absolute effort . \n however , the decrement in power output is partly recovered after 1 wk of heat acclimatization and almost fully restored after 2 wk . \n furthermore , our data seem to confirm that sustainable power output is related to a given relative intensity ( 24 ) , which is partly reflected in the maintenance of hr within a certain range . finally , because of the reduction in air density associated with cycling in hot ambient conditions , speed was not different between tth-3 and ttc .",

         "worksites in glass and metal works , foundries , rolling mills , in the vicinity of hardening furnaces , rotary kilns in the cement industry , high - temperature laboratory furnaces , as well as firefighting , are associated , in addition to common mechanical hazards ( e.g. , due to splashes of molten metals and slag ) , sparks and direct contact with open fires , with hazards caused by emission of harmful optic radiation within the visible ( vis ) and infrared ( ir ) spectrum range . \n excessive exposure to ir radiation leads to dryness of the mucous membranes , burns of the eyeball and development of cataracts . \n protection against thermal hazards due to excessive amounts of ir radiation reaching the eyes is provided by protective optic filters installed in spectacles , goggles or face protections . besides protecting the user against hazardous ir radiation \n , such filters should ensure that the object / area of work can be seen clearly . if the level of ir radiation is very high , \n the use of filters reflecting radiation is recommended , as it allows the temperature increase in the filter itself to be reduced . \n the filters currently used for the protection of the face and eyes against hazardous ir radiation are of metallic reflective type , made of glass or organic material ( mainly polycarbonate ) bases coated with a single metallic layer for reflectance of ir radiation or absorption filters . \n absorption filters are manufactured from dyed glass obtained in a mass staining process by introduction of a factor modifying the radiation within the vis and near infrared ( nir ) spectrum range passing through the filter . \n the effect of a protective optical filter obtained as a result of this process is based on absorption of a large proportion of optic radiation , whereas only a small proportion of radiation the filter is exposed to is reflected . \n this is an undesirable phenomenon , contributing to deterioration of the filter user 's comfort . \n reflective metallic filters are obtained by deposition of a metallic layer of copper ( cu ) or gold ( au ) on mineral or organic bases . \n such filters take advantage of the characteristic properties of the metals used in their production , i.e. , significant reflection coefficient for ir radiation and significant transmittance for the vis spectrum . despite the fact that the technique of deposition of interference layers has been known for many years   the application of thin film ir filters in eye protections to block \n the previous papers published by the authors of this study   contain descriptions of the structure of interference filters designed for application in eye protections \n highly effective in reduction of ir radiation with high level of transmission of the vis spectrum . \n the authors investigated also the optical and mechanical parameters of the newly developed protective optic filters manufactured with the use of interference technologies . \n the analysis of the results of the conducted tests demonstrated numerous advantages of interference technology application in the construction of protective filters , including : improved resistance to damage of the external protective filter surface ( cracking , scratching etc . ) as well as high reflection coefficients for the nir spectrum . \n the aim of the present study was to compare the optic properties of protective filters manufactured by taking advantage of the interference technology and those coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation . \n the coefficients characterizing their optic parameters , allowing to assess the protective properties within the vis and ir spectrum range were compared . \n the following coefficients were analysed : \n luminous transmittance (  \n v),ir transmittance within the 7801400  nm range (  \n a),ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range (  \n n),ir reflectance within the 7802000  nm range ( r \n n),ir absorptance within the 7802000  nm range ( a \n n),shade number ( n ) . \n luminous transmittance (  \n v ) , ir transmittance within the 7801400  nm range (  \n a ) , ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range (  \n n ) , ir reflectance within the 7802000  nm range ( r \n n ) , ir absorptance within the 7802000  nm range ( a \n n ) , the level of protection ( shade number ) is determined on the basis of luminous transmittance ( the higher protection level correlates with the higher level of ir radiation blocked and appropriately lower vis light transmittance ) . \n protection level consists of a code number ( e.g. , 4 ) for ir filters and a shade number ( e.g. , 3 , 5 , 7 ) calculated according to the following equation : \n ( 1 ) \n where  \n v \n =  luminous transmittance . for the particular level of protection , the mean ir transmittance within the 7801400 and 7802000  nm ranges as well as the ir reflectance and absorptance within the 7802000  nm range are determined . \n for comparative analysis of the metallic reflective filters available in the market versus the interference filters developed by the authors , the following samples were prepared for the tests : \n off the shelf metallic reflective filters on a polycarbonate base ( flat parallel plate of 50  mm diameter and 2  mm thickness with a metallic layer of copper ( cu )  protection levels : 4 - 3 , 4 - 5

silicon dioxide ) . \n  off the shelf metallic reflective filters on a polycarbonate base ( flat parallel plate of 50  mm diameter and 2  mm thickness with a metallic layer of copper ( cu )

optical properties of the filters were measured with a cary 5000 spectrophotometer ( varian , australia ) . the spectrophotometer enabled transmittance or reflectance of optical radiation within the vis and nir spectrum to be recorded with 1  nm steps and 0.001% resolution level . \n spectral transmittance and reflectance measurements were carried out within the wavelength range of 7802000  nm . \n the quartz halogen lamp was used as a source of radiation . to detect transmitted or reflected radiation \n the photomultiplier tube and lead sulphide detector were used for vis and nir spectrum , respectively . \n spectral transmittance was measured with incident radiation falling normally on the filter surface in the visual centre ( defined as in ) . for spectral reflectance \n the measurements were taken every second owing to the high absorption of investigated filters within the nir region . \n since the minimum averaging time of the cary 5000 spectrophotometer was 0.0125  s , the values of transmittance or reflectance were measured 125 times for a given wavelength . \n the aforementioned coefficients were calculated from the following equations [ 1012 ] : \n luminous

. exposure to an excessive amount of radiation from this range \n can result in burns of the retina and , in extreme cases , its permanent damage . \n , chronic long - term exposure may lead to the development of cataracts , referred to as ir or glass worker 's cataracts . in view of the above \n the results presented on the graphs in figure 1 and the determined transmittance values ( see table 2 ) indicate unequivocally more effective blocking of ir radiation provided by interference filters . \n the values of  \n a and  \n n for interference filters are lower even by an order of magnitude than those obtained for the metallic reflective filters . \n for instance , the mean value of ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range for interference filters with protection level 4 - 5 ( one of the most common protection levels used in the metallurgic industry ) equals 0.006% and is significantly lower than the maximum acceptable value specified in , which is 10.6% . \n for all the investigated filters , the values of r \n n exceed 60% , which classifies them in the group of filters with increased ir reflectance . \n the levels of the ir absorptance for metallic reflective filters and interference filters of 4 - 3 and 4 - 5 protection class are similar . for the highest of the investigated protection levels  4 - 7 \n the above findings are important for selection of a filter appropriate for the radiation source . \n the selection of filter protection level is dependent on the temperature of the radiation source . \n the 4 - 7 level is used for radiation sources whose temperature exceeds 1600  k ( e.g. , occurs in the metallurgical industry ) . with such high temperatures , \n reduction of filter heating as a result of exposure to ir radiation is important . as it follows from comparative analysis of the optic properties of filters taking advantage of the interference technology and filters coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation \n , the interference filters provide a more effective blocking of ir radiation in comparison with the currently used protective filters . \n ",
         "the paper analyses the selected optical parameters of protective optic filters used for protection of the eyes against hazardous radiation within the visible ( vis ) and near infrared ( nir ) spectrum range . \n the indexes characterizing transmission and reflection of optic radiation incident on the filter are compared . \n as it follows from the completed analysis , the newly developed interference filters provide more effective blocking of infrared radiation in comparison with the currently used protective filters .",

up of 7.8 years , compared with patients assigned to antidiabetic treatment in accordance with national guidelines ( 21 ) . \n a 5.5-year extension of that same study demonstrated that the multifactorial therapy was associated with sustained lower risk of cardiovascular events or death ( 20 ) . in the steno-2 study , \n lipid -

         "endotracheal intubation is one of the most important skills for anesthesiologists in securing the airway during general anesthesia and resuscitation . \n failure to secure the airway can cause anesthesia - related life - threatening morbidity and mortality . \n however , the difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation rate still remains at 1.513% due to poor reliability of traditional protocols , algorithms , and combinations of screening tools in identifying a potentially difficult airway . \n due to the portable , noninvasive characteristics , point - of - care ultrasound ( us ) technique has been widely used in the operating room for ultrasound - guided nerve block , central venous access , and pneumothorax diagnosis . with improved visualization of airway structures , \n prasad et al . first found that us can reliably image all of the structures visualized by ct , and the infrahyoid airway structure parameters measured by ultrasound agree well with the parameters measured by ct . \n adhikari et al . further demonstrated that the anterior neck soft tissue thickness measured by ultrasound at hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an index to predict difficult laryngoscopy , but only the anterior neck soft tissue thickness at thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy . \n interestingly , they did not find a correlation between us measurements and clinical screening tests . \n .   also found that an abundance of fat tissue at the anterior neck region as detected by ultrasound in israeli obesity patients was a very good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy , being a much better predictor than body mass index ( bmi ) per se . \n however , a similar study in the unites states showed that us quantification of anterior soft tissue and general bedside screening tests failed to predict difficult laryngoscopy in american obese patients , suggesting that racial or body shape differences might exist . to define the role of airway us in predicting difficult laryngoscopy \n , we evaluated the feasibility of ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population . \n after approval of the research protocol by the local hospital ethics committee for human studies and obtaining personal informed consent , 203 american society of anesthesiologists ( asa ) grade i and ii adult patients undergoing elective surgeries and receiving general anesthesia were included in this study . \n exclusion criteria included patients who had facial , cervical , pharyngeal and epiglottis surgical or trauma history , patients with most teeth lost , and patients with arthritis . \n the modified mallampati score ( mms ) was specified according to the visibility of pharyngeal structures with the patient in an upright sitting position , head in neutral position , mouth wide open , and tongue protruding to its maximum without phonation ( figure 1a ) . \n class i is visualization of the hard palate , soft palate , fauces , uvula , and pillars . \n class ii is visualization of the hard palate , soft palate , fauces , and base of uvula . \n thyromental distance ( tmd ) was measured from the mental prominence to the thyroid cartilage with the patient s neck extended fully . \n interincisor gap ( iig ) was measured from the upper central incisors to the lower central incisors while the patient s mouth was fully opened . \n ultrasound measurements were performed by the primary investigator with the patient supine and the head and neck in neutral position . \n the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue at hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels were obtained transversely across the anterior surface of the neck with a 136 mhz hfl38 linear array ultrasound probe attached to a sonosite s - nerve machine ( sonosite inc . , \n the minimal distance from the hyoid bone to skin surface ( dshb ) was measured ( figure 2a , 2b ) . at thyrohyoid membrane level , \n the distance from skin to epiglottis midway ( dsem ) between the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage was measured ( figure 2c , 2d ) . at anterior commissure level , \n the minimal distance from skin to anterior commissure ( dsac ) was obtained ( figure 2e , 2f ) . \n after anesthesia induction with midazolam 0.04 mg / kg , propofol 22.5 mg / kg , fentanyl 24 g / kg , and succinylcholine 2 mg / kg , endotracheal intubation was carried out by anesthesia providers with a minimum of 2 years of endotracheal intubation experience . \n the macintosh blades were used to expose the target larynx , and no external laryngeal pressure was used to facilitate this process . \n classification of laryngoscopic views was based on the method described by cormack and lehane ( figure 1b ) . \n continuous data are expressed as means ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) ; categorical data are expressed as numbers of occurrences ( percents ) . \n comparison analysis was performed using the t - test for continuous variables and chi - square or fisher exact tests , as appropriate , for non - continuous variables . \n the best fit lines of dshb , dsem , dsac , mms , iig , and tmd were determined using a least - squares regression technique . \n receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analyses were used to calculate the comparable threshold values of dshb , dsem , dsac , tmd , iig , and mms . \n optimal cutoff values were calculated using the youden index ( calculated as : sensitivity + specificity  100 ) . \n statistical analyses were performed using medcalc for windows , version 12.6.1.0 ( medcalc software , ostend , belgium ) . \n the level of statistical significance was p<0.05 , and p<0.0001 was considered to be very statistically significant . \n continuous data are expressed as means ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) ; categorical data are expressed as numbers of occurrences ( percents ) . \n comparison analysis was performed using the t - test for continuous variables and chi - square or fisher exact tests , as appropriate , for non - continuous variables . \n the best fit lines of dshb , dsem , dsac , mms , iig , and tmd were determined using a least - squares regression technique . \n receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analyses were used to calculate the comparable threshold values of dshb , dsem , dsac , tmd , iig , and mms . \n optimal cutoff values were calculated using the youden index ( calculated as : sensitivity + specificity  100 ) . \n statistical analyses were performed using medcalc for windows , version 12.6.1.0 ( medcalc software , ostend , belgium ) . \n the level of statistical significance was p<0.05 , and p<0.0001 was considered to be very statistically significant . \n a total of 203 eligible patients ( 120 females , 83 males ) were included in this study . \n there were 28 of 203 patients ( 13.8% ) categorized as difficult laryngoscopy , and 50% of patients with difficult laryngoscopy in our study were males . \n no differences were noted in sex , age , and height , but bw and bmi values in the difficult laryngoscopy group were higher . the bmi value was 25.632.80 kg / m for the difficult laryngoscopy group , and 23.613.43 kg / m for the easy laryngoscopy group ( p<0.05 ) . \n airway evaluation parameters , including mms , tmd , iig , dshb , dsem , and dsac , are shown in table 2 . \n the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue measured by us were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group compared to the easy laryngoscopy group at the level of the hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure . \n however , no statistically significant difference was found between easy and difficult laryngoscopy groups for tmd and iig . \n a strong positive correlation existed between dsem and dshb ; moderate positive correlations between dsem and dsac , dshb and dsac ; small positive correlations between mms and dshb , mms and dsem , mms and dsac ; and very small positive correlations between tmd and iig . \n the correlation coefficients along with 95% confidence interval ( ci ) between dsem and dshb , dsem and dsac , dshb and dsac , mms and dshb , mms and dsem , mms and dsac , and between tmd and iig were 0.74 ( 0.670.80 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.60 ( 0.500.68 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.69 ( 0.610.75 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.32 ( 0.190.44 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.27 ( 0.140.40 , p=0.0001 ) , 0.32 ( 0.190.44 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.18 ( 0.05 to 0.31 , p=0.0089 ) , respectively ( figure 3a3 g ) . \n small negative correlation were found between iig and mms ( r=0.27 , p=0.0001 ) ; and very small negative correlations were found between mms and tmd ( r=0.20 , p=0.0042 ) , iig and dsac ( r=0.18 , p=0.0113 ) , and iig and dshb ( r=0.15 , p=0.0344 ) ( figure 3h3k ) . \n no correlations were found between tmd and dsem , tmd and dshb , and tmd and dsac ( data not shown ) . to further assess the roles of mms , iig , tmd , dshb , dsem , and dsac in predicting difficult laryngoscopy , \n the roc curves ( figure 4 ) were drawn using medcalc software with laryngoscopy grade over ii as the threshold of difficult laryngoscopy . as determined by the youden index , the optimal cutoff values ( with sensitivity and specificity in parentheses ) for mms , iig , tmd , dshb , dsem , and dsac to predict difficult laryngoscopy were over 2 ( 50.0% , 82.3% ) , 3.8 cm ( 75.0% , 48.0% ) , 5.9 cm ( 21.4% , 93.7% ) , 1.28 cm ( 85.7% , 85.1% ) , 1.78 cm ( 100.0% , 66.3% ) , and 1.1 cm ( 75.0% , 80.6% ) , respectively . \n the areas under the roc curve ( aucs ) were significantly different from the area under the reference line ( area=0.5 ) for mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac ; and the p values of mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac were all less than 0.0001 . \n no difference between the aucs of tmd , iig , and the area under the reference line were identified , suggesting that mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac might be better than tmd and iig in predicting difficult laryngoscopy ( table 3 ) . \n with the rapid expansion of portable us in anesthesia for guiding the placement of central venous catheters and the performance of regional block [ 1113 ] , some preliminary results exploring the feasibility of portable us in airway evaluation and management have been reported , even though the air attenuates us transmission and thereby creates artifacts [ 35,14,15 ] . in the present study , we compared the role of the us measurements and traditional screening tests , including iig , tmd , and mms , in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population . \n we found that strong positive linear correlations existed among the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue measured by us at hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels . \n the aucs of mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac are all over 0.7 , indicating they are all good parameters in predicting difficult laryngoscopy . \n the aucs of tmd and iig were less than 0.7 , suggesting that tmd and iig were poor parameters in predicating difficult laryngoscopy . to clearly visualize the glottis and smoothly finish the intubation procedure , anesthesiologists need to place the laryngoscope blade to the base of the epiglottis , and then lift it up \n therefore , in addition to the performer s skills and experience , many factors , including dental status , mouth opening , oropharyngeal space , mandibular space , and neck motility , are all involved this complicated procedure . \n mms mainly reflects the size of the tongue relative to the oral cavity , or the oropharyngeal space [ 1820 ] , iig means the mouth opening , and tmd can reflect the length of the neck . \n the mallapati score was first introduced by mallampati et al . in 1985 , and then modified by samsoon and young in 1987 . due to the simple and clear evaluation standards , mms has become one of the most commonly used tools to predict a difficult airway . \n however , mms mainly depends on patient cooperation and body position , which can greatly affect the accuracy of airway evaluation . \n therefore , mms has been reported to be a good predictor by many , but was found to be of limited value by others . a recent meta - analysis involving 177 088 patients \n demonstrate that mms is inadequate as a stand - alone test to predict difficult laryngoscopy or tracheal intubation , but it may well be a part of a multifactorial model for the prediction of a difficult tracheal intubation . \n iig has been repeatedly reported to be associated with difficult intubation , but our results showed that there was no significant difference in mean iig between difficult and easy laryngoscopy groups ( 3.740.43 vs. 3.860.47 cm ) . \n furthermore , the auc of iig was 0.580.06 , which was far less than 0.7 , suggesting that iig might be not a good screening parameter for predicting difficult laryngoscopy in our study . \n our iig conclusion was similar to the previous report by savva , but different from results of other studies . \n whether this difference was really caused by racial factors requires further investigation because the measurements of iig need patients to fully cooperate . \n tmd is also used as a screening test to predict difficult airway , but our results suggest that tmd is not a useful screening test . \n however , we could not determine whether this was because of limited patient numbers or because tmd was not useful in predicting difficult airway due to the small sample size . \n ct , mri , and other imaging techniques can accurately measure the thickness of anterior neck soft tissue , but they are expensive and unavailable in many operating rooms . \n portable us is inexpensive , rapid , and convenient to perform in the operating room , and most importantly , it can quantify the neck fat thickness as accurately as mi . \n however , the results of 2 prior studies focusing on soft tissue thickness at and below the level of the vocal cords in a specific group of obese patients are inconsistent . \n further measured the anterior neck soft tissue at the hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels , which is important to displace the glottis by the laryngoscopic blade , and found that us measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at the level of hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopies , and a 2.8-cm us measurement at the thyrohyoid membrane was a good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy . \n our results show that the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue at the level of the hyoid bone ( 1.51 [ 95% ci=1.401.61 ] cm vs. 0.98 [ 95% ci=0.941.02 ] cm ) , the thyrohyoid membrane ( 2.39 [ 95% ci=2.172.62 ] cm vs. 1.49 [ 95% ci=1.431.55 ] cm ) , and the anterior commissure ( 1.30 [ 95% ci=1.181.42 ] cm vs. 0.92 [ 95% ci=0.870.94 ] cm ) were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group and were significantly correlated . \n furthermore , the ranges of anterior neck soft tissue for those with difficult laryngoscopy were mutually exclusive from those patients with an easy laryngoscopy , indicating that they are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy , even though the ranges of these 3 parameters were smaller than in a previous report . \n glottis exposure by place laryngoscope is a very complicated procedure , and many subjective and objective factors such as the provider s skills and experience , airway secretions , and abnormalities of anatomical structures are involved in this procedure . \n the investigators were not totally blinded to the study purpose , and some clinical signs might indicate the possibility of difficult laryngoscopy , which can cause some bias during us measurements . due to the low incidence of difficult laryngoscopy , it is impossible for us to randomly assign an equal number of patients to both groups , thus there were 28 patients in the difficult group and 175 patients in the easy group . \n anterior neck soft tissue thicknesses measured by us at the hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy . the commonly used screening tests for difficult intubation have only poor - to - moderate predictive power when used alone . \n combinations of these screening tests or risk factors with us measurements might increase the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy .",

threatening events , such as cardiac tamponade . \n delayed postoperative cardiac tamponade following an open - heart operation is an infrequent , but potentially serious complication . \n although previous reports have dealt with the clinical features and management of this problem , an optimal approach to prevent postoperative pericardial effusion and related problems has not been clearly defined [ 3 , 5 ] . \n this study aims to investigate the effects of posterior pericardiotomy ( pp ) on the development of pericardial effusion , tamponade , and atrial fibrillation following cas . \n this prospective randomized case - controlled study was carried out on 96 patients ( 77 men and 19 women ; age : 35 - 78 years ; mean : 58.1 years ) . \n the patients , undergoing cas performed by the same surgical team between march 2012 and january 2013 in istanbul mehmet akif ersoy thoracic and cardiovascular surgery research and training hospital , were assigned to 3 groups . \n after the study had received the approval of the institutional review board , informed consent was obtained from all patients . \n the treating physician did not know the groups to which individual patients had been assigned . patients with renal failure , \n hyperthyroidism , emergency cas , history of cardiac operations associated with valvular heart disease , low ejection fraction ( < 35% ) , and preoperative atrial fibrillation or other rhythm disorders , as well as patients who did not provide research authorization , were excluded from the study . \n the study groups included patients after pp ( group i , n = 30 ) , a control group ( group ii , n = 33 ) , and patients without pp who received posterior pericardial tubes ( the tube was placed behind the heart and sutured to the adjacent pericardial tissue to avoid tube - induced ventricular arrhythmias ) ( group iii , n = 33 ) . \n i , a 4-cm longitudinal incision was made parallel and posterior to the left phrenic nerve , extending from the left inferior pulmonary vein to the diaphragm , as described by mulay et al . . \n in group i , the relationship between the location of the distal part of circumflex anastomosis and pp was also carefully considered . \n moreover , all patients underwent pleurotomy and lateral pericardiotomy ( approximately 3.5 - 4.5 cm in size ) in which the internal thoracic artery ( ita ) was used for anastomosis and positioned medially to the lung , which allowed the ita to run without kinking or twisting . \n the inferior part of the pericardium was left open ( 2 cm ) in our study . \n a straight tube was placed in the anterior mediastinum and an angled tube was placed in the left hemithorax in all patients . \n the same postoperative pain management protocol was provided for all patients . after a routine closure of the chest \n , drains were frequently milked and stripped to ensure tube patency during the intensive care unit stay . \n the chest tubes were removed on the 2 postoperative day when the drainage became serous ; otherwise , they remained in use for one or more days . \n pericardial effusion was defined as the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space determined by transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) . \n the presence of pericardial effusion on 2-dimensional tte was assessed using the criteria previously described by bakhshandeh et al . . \n two - dimensional echocardiography was performed on postoperative days 1 and 5 , as well as 1 month after surgery . \n the maximum diastolic separation between the pericardium and epicardium was measured at the tip of the mitral valve leaflet . \n when the diastolic echo - free space between the left ventricular posterior wall and the pericardium was < 10 mm , the pericardial effusion was classified as small . \n when the space was 10 - 20 mm , the effusion was classified as moderate , while for spaces > 20 mm , the effusion was classified as severe . \n if the diagnosis of evident pericardial effusion ( moderate or severe ) was established , tte was performed daily , and the volume of the effusion was observed closely . \n we compared the groups with regard to the volume of effusion on postoperative days 1 , 5 , and 30 . \n patients with no or small pericardial effusion and an uneventful postoperative course were discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5 . \n patients with moderate and severe pericardial effusion were treated with non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs . during hospitalization , \n all patients were continuously monitored with the use of a portable electrocardiogram ( ecg , telemetry ) to detect atrial fibrillation . \n atrial fibrillation was considered to be persistent and clinically significant when it lasted for more than 5 min . \n statistical analysis was performed with the ncss ( number cruncher statistical system ) 2007 statistical software ( utah , usa ) . \n one - way anova and tukey hsd tests were used for the statistical analysis of the groups parameters . \n the differences were also analyzed using  tests and independent t - tests where applicable . \n the hospital mortality in the study was 2% ( n = 2 ) ; both patients were in group ii . \n one of these patients experienced low cardiac output during and following reoperation due to cardiac tamponade and died on postoperative day 12 . \n the other patient had an uneventful postoperative course , but was readmitted to the hospital on postoperative day 11 due to cardiac tamponade and acute kidney failure . \n pericardial drainage was performed , but the patient died of sepsis on postoperative day 45 . \n the groups did not differ in terms of demographic parameters , which are summarized in table i. the average total volume of drainage ( mediastinal and thoracic ) during the first 24 hours was similar in all groups ( 536.67  237.873 cc , 656.97  407.634 cc , and 577.27  374.349 cc , respectively ; p = 0.383 ) ( table ii ) . \n in group i , the volume of the fluid evacuated by mediastinal drainage was lower than in groups ii and iii , but the difference was not statistically significant ( table ii ) . \n two patients in group ii required reoperation due to excessive mediastinal hemorrhage and cardiac tamponade . \n the incidence of cardiac tamponade was higher in group ii ( n = 4 , 12% ) , and the differences between the groups were statistically significant ( p = 0.019 ) . \n two of the patients with pericardial tamponade were managed by subxiphoid pericardial drainage alone ; 400 to 1000 ml of fluid was removed . \n two patients in group iii were reoperated due to excessive hemorrhage in the early postoperative period . \n demographic variables in groups differential drainage volume from each chest tube the volume of pericardial drainage was added to the volume of mediastinal drainage for group iii . \n the average volume of pericardial effusion significantly decreased with time in groups i and ii ( fig . \n approximately 50% of the patients had small pericardial effusion on the first postoperative day ; no difference between the groups was found . \n moderate pericardial effusion was detected in 8 patients ( group i , n = 1 ; group ii , n = 3 ; group iii , n = 4 ) on the first postoperative day , in 11 patients ( group ii , n = 7 ; group iii , n = 4 ) on the fifth postoperative day , and in 7 patients on the 30 postoperative day ( group ii , n = 6 ; group iii , n = 1 ) during the study period . \n severe pericardial effusion was detected in one patient ( group ii , n = 1 ) on the first postoperative day , in one patient ( group iii , n = 1 ) on the fifth postoperative day , and in one patient ( group iii , n = 1 ) on the 30 postoperative day . \n the incidence of moderate to severe pericardial effusion in group i was significantly lower than in the other groups on the 30 postoperative day ( n = 0 , p = 0.028 ) . \n figure 1 shows a comparison of the groups with regard to the volume of pericardial effusion . \n four of these patients ( group ii , n = 4 ) underwent drainage of severe pericardial effusion on postoperative days 0 , 1 , 11 , and 17 ; one patient ( group ii ) underwent sternal dehiscence repair . \n comparison of the groups with regard to the volume of pericardial effusion atrial fibrillation was detected in 24 of the 96 patients ( 25% : 6 patients in group i , 11 patients in group ii , 7 patients in group iii ) . \n no statistically significant difference between the groups ( p = 0.392 ) was present in this respect . \n the length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in group i ( 6.63  2.71 , p = 0.03 ) . \n there are a number of articles favoring the use of posterior pericardiotomy , but no comprehensive comparison has been conducted between the use of a pericardial tube and pp in patients undergoing cas . \n pericardial effusion and the associated complications are common after all kinds of cardiac surgery due to postoperative bleeding or post - cardiotomy syndrome . \n however , clinically significant pericardial effusion occurs rarely and can be a crucial risk factor for cardiac tamponade ( 1% ) . \n posterior pericardiotomy has been reported to reduce the prevalence of pericardial effusion from 40% to 8% with a simultaneous reduction in the prevalence of svt ( supraventricular tachycardia ) . \n the semi - sitting position helps thoracic drainage in the early postoperative period by supporting the patient 's back . despite all the above - mentioned measures , the posterior wall of the pericardial sac forms an unprotected space that may cause pericardial effusion to develop septae . \n this leads to the appearance of adhesions preventing blood drainage , leading to cardiac compression . \n moreover , the collection of fluid may persist due to bleeding resulting from the use of anticoagulants . \n in fact , anti - coagulants ( low - molecular - weight heparin ) were used postoperatively in our patients with atrial fibrillation . \n posterior pericardial effusion can be evacuated by placing a tube in the posterior pericardial space . \n the placement of the pericardial tube is simple to perform , but it may have certain drawbacks . the tube may come into contact with coronary grafts during cardiac activity or movement . \n however , the patients included in the study ( in group iii as well as the other groups ) did not exhibit any arrhythmias ( apart from af ) or ischemic changes \n . this may be due to the fact that we fixed the pericardial tube to the surface of the diaphragmatic pericardium with polypropylene . \n pp or the use of posterior tubes may lessen the volume of pericardial effusion after cas . \n moreover , patients in group i exhibited regression of pericardial effusion during 30 postoperative days . \n this proved that pp had a lasting effect on pericardial effusion , as presented by figure 1 . \n what stands out in our results is that pericardial effusion may occur if no intervention is performed on the posterior part of the pericardium . \n this technique is suggested in both cas and valve surgery , but it is not routinely used [ 13 , 14 ] . \n what is more , pp is recommended by the american college of chest physicians guidelines and by some authors as a preventive technique for postoperative atrial fibrillation [ 15 , 16 ] . \n supraventricular tachyarrhythmias , mainly in the form of atrial fibrillation , occur in up to 40% of patients undergoing cas . \n although af is usually benign , it can cause hemodynamic instability , prolonged hospital stay , and increased cost and , in rare cases , predispose to cerebrovascular accidents . \n the antiarrhythmic effect of pp may , however , be a theoretical issue , as we observed similar results regarding atrial fibrillation in all the groups . \n in fact , the results of our study were different than expected with regard to atrial fibrillation compared to other researchers [ 4 , 6 , 16 ] . \n additionally , asimakopoulos et al . also found that the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was not significantly reduced ( 20% ) in comparison to the conventional technique ( 26% ) . \n another issue is that humans have increasingly longer life spans , which may result in higher numbers of reoperations . \n ellman et al . found that patent coronary grafts were the most commonly injured structures during reoperation ( 46% ) . \n we routinely cover the aorta and proximal anastomoses of grafts with thymic fat tissue and the anterior wall of the pericardial cavity . \n we also place an anterior mediastinal tube over the thymic fat tissue before closing the sternum in all patients . behind the heart , \n adhesions between the inferior surface of the heart and the diaphragm can cause difficulties when dissecting the tissue layers during reoperation . \n mulay et al . demonstrated that pp provides an effective drainage pathway from the left pleural cavity , thereby reducing the prevalence of pericardial effusion . \n for this reason , pp may be advantageous for reoperated patients in terms of reducing adhesions related to pericardial effusion . \n echocardiography can be useful in confirming and identifying the presence of pericardial effusion , hematoma , and tamponade . according to the results of our study , it is important to diagnose pericardial effusion at an early stage . \n hemodynamic deterioration due to pericardial fluid can be divided into four stages : pericardial fluid , hemodynamic tamponade , echocardiographic tamponade , clinical tamponade . \n echocardiographic follow - up of patients with pericardial effusion might be a factor extending the duration of hospital stay . \n we recommend the pp technique and routine echocardiographic monitoring during the postoperative period in patients undergoing cas . \n there is not sufficient research regarding the effects of pp on long - term results . \n the present study also demonstrated that patients undergoing pp required a significantly shorter hospital stay and experienced lower rates of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade than the other groups . \n this research was carried out on a small set of patients ( n = 96 ) ; therefore , there was an imbalance between men and women enrolled in this trial . \n group ii had a 2-fold elevation in the number of patients going into af postoperatively . \n in conclusion , pp may be a useful technique in the prevention of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade after cas because it is simple , safe , and effective . \n . \n oral presentation at the 22 \n annual meeting of the asian society for cardiovascular and thoracic surgery that will be held in istanbul on april 3 -

         "cancer places a huge burden on society and has been identified as the leading cause of death in both more and less economically developed countries . \n projections based on the globocan 2012 estimates predict a substantive increase to 19.3 million new cancer cases per year by 2025 , due to growth and ageing of the global population . \n south africa , like other developing countries , is also experiencing an increase in the overall burden of disease attributable to cancer , with the number of new cancer cases predicted to increase by 46% by 2030 . \n this is likely to result in an increase in the use of cancer chemotherapy agents , which assist in preventing the proliferation , invasion , and metastases of the cancer cells . \n the basis for chemotherapy is anticancer drugs containing platinum , that is , cisplatin ( cis - diamminedichloroplatinum ii ) and carboplatin ( cis - diammine 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylatoplatinum ii ) . \n other chemotherapy drugs include nitrogen mustard , amino - nicotinamide , dichloromethotrexate , bleomycin , and 5-fluorouracil [ 5 , 6 ] . \n the first of these drugs , that is , cisplatin , consists of a divalent pt ( ii ) central atom and four ligands of cis - positioned pairs of chlorine atoms or amine groups . \n since its discovery in the 1970s , cisplatin continues to be hailed as one of the most potent cancer chemotherapeutics in children and adults , as it is unique and unmatched in its effectiveness against many cancers , namely , osteogenic sarcoma , medulloblastoma , testicular , cervical , and ovarian cancers . \n similarly , its toxicity profile is expansive , involving the gastrointestinal , hematologic , renal , and auditory systems . \n while the use of saline hydration and mannitol diuresis may prevent nephrotoxicity , neurotoxicity is still not curable or preventable . \n ototoxicity refers to the hearing disorder that results from the temporary or permanent inner ear dysfunction after treatment with an ototoxic drug . \n other drug classes known to have ototoxic properties include aminoglycosides , loop diuretics , quinine , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and antiretroviral therapy ( art ) . \n this is of concern in south africa , as it is estimated that 12.2% of the population ( 6.4 million persons ) were hiv positive in 2012 , which is 1.2 million more people living with hiv than in 2008 ( 10.6% , or 5.2 million ) . \n resultantly , art exposure had almost doubled from 16.6% in 2008 to 31.2% in 2012 . \n not only will many infected people be at risk for ototoxicity due to arts , but a large number will also be susceptible to hiv - related cancers , such as kaposi 's sarcoma , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma , and cervical cancer , as well as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis , conditions that often require pharmacological therapy with the adverse side effect of ototoxicity . \n it is possible that their treatments could consist of simultaneous use of more than one ototoxic drug , increasing the likelihood of ototoxicity . \n all health care professionals managing patients with cancer should therefore be knowledgeable about the ototoxic properties of cisplatin . \n however , malhotra   indicated that most oncologists in india do not make referrals for audiological evaluations of patients receiving cisplatin , while a study in south africa revealed that the effects of ototoxicity , the role of audiologists , and need for their expertise were not fully realized by the oncologists sampled . \n this is further supported by evidence from the south african study of khoza - shangase and jina   which indicated that most general practitioners sampled also do not appear to carry out ototoxicity monitoring strategies , despite being aware of their own role within an ototoxicity monitoring programme . \n this review therefore aims to serve as resource for health professionals to enhance their understanding of ototoxicity as well as their roles within an ototoxicity monitoring programme by providing an overview and description of this condition in patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving cisplatin chemotherapy . \n the review identified peer - reviewed articles available from january 1975 to july 2015 on the topic of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity and ototoxicity monitoring and included english articles only . \n the same researcher conducted the literature search and reviewed the abstracts and articles for inclusion in the study . \n studies were identified using keyword and mesh term searches of electronic databases depicted in table 1 . a manual search of relevant authors and journals \n the references cited by each publication , review , or book chapter were reviewed in order to locate additional potential publications . in order to be selected , the article had to present data on either cisplatin ototoxicity and/or ototoxicity monitoring in human participants , and no research designs were excluded . running these searches yielded a total of 2106 records , of which 1581 were excluded based on the title and/or abstract as well as duplication . \n eighty - five relevant articles , comprising six national and 79 international articles , were selected . \n a perusal of narrative reviews of other auditory pathologies was conducted in an attempt to determine areas of significance for an overview of cisplatin ototoxicity . \n this resulted in the following eight areas being included : the mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity , clinical presentation , risk factors , incidence rates in adults and children , the effect on quality of life , ototoxicity monitoring , otoprotective strategies , and management of an ototoxic hearing loss . \n one such mechanism , the antioxidant model , involves the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) within the cochlea and consequent reduction in antioxidant enzymes following exposure to cisplatin chemotherapy [ 1620 ] . \n another mechanism of cisplatin ototoxicity involves the significant contribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 3 isoform ( nox3 ) to the generation of reactive oxygen species within the cochlea , when activated by cisplatin [ 17 , 21 ] , while a third mechanism relates to the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel ( trpv1 ) [ 2224 ] . \n the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity therefore include the following:creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation ands - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  .with the cellular mechanisms of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity including damage to the outer hair cells , supporting cells , marginal cells of the stria vascularis , spiral ligament , and the spiral ganglion cells , it is evident that the structures of the inner ear are most susceptible to damage by cisplatin chemotherapy , with apoptotic degeneration of the hair cell in the organ of corti being most prominent . \n the outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea are most affected [ 27 , 28 ] . \n this leads to an initial elevation of high frequency audiometric thresholds , followed by a progressive loss into the lower frequencies with continued therapy [ 27 , 28 ] . \n knowledge of the different mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity is important for health care professionals as it will create an awareness of its complexity and the resulting clinical presentation . \n creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation and s - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  . \n cisplatin - associated ototoxicity usually manifests as irreversible , progressive , bilateral , high frequency sensorineural hearing loss   with tinnitus . \n the latter may occur with or without a hearing loss   and may be permanent or transient , sometimes disappearing a few hours after treatment   or alternatively persisting a week after treatment . while most of the hearing loss is permanent , there is sometimes sporadic and partial recovery . in addition , \n rare cases of unilateral hearing loss have been reported , which are usually explained by tumour location and surgical or therapeutic intervention on the affected side . moreover \n , the hearing loss is not always symmetrical [ 33 , 34 ] , with jenkins et al .   finding that 75% of women on cisplatin chemotherapy displayed an asymmetry of hearing thresholds of at least 10  db between ears posttreatment . \n schmidt et al . , in their investigation of 55 children on cisplatin chemotherapy , found that the high frequency hearing thresholds were slightly elevated in the left ear and that males had a greater degree of hearing loss than the females . \n the degree of hearing loss is often variable and is related to the dose ; that is , the higher the cumulative dose , the greater the ototoxic effect [ 35 , 36 ] . \n the duration , number of cycles administered , and method of administration   also influence cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . \n additional factors that may increase ototoxicity include exposure to concomitant noise , chemicals , and other ototoxic medications . \n furthermore , evidence also shows that melanin content is related to an increased risk of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . \n individuals with dark eyes and therefore a higher melanin content in the cochlear are at greater risk of ototoxic damage , as the melanin causes retention of the platinum within the cochlear and subsequently increases the risk of damage [ 41 , 42 ] . \n individuals presenting with renal insufficiency , that is , high levels of serum creatinine , are at a greater risk for cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . genetic risk factors , such as megalin and glutathione s - transferases gene polymorphism , have also been reported to influence cisplatin ototoxicity , as do physiological factors such as age , with younger children   and older adults ( older than 46 years )   presenting with a greater severity of hearing damage . \n awareness of these risk factors may assist health care professionals with informational counselling of the patient receiving cisplatin chemotherapy . \n the incidence of cisplatin ototoxicity is variable in adults ( table 2 ) and children ( table 3 ) . \n the variations may be due to a number of factors , such as differences in the dose , both within a cycle and the total amount administered over multiple cycles , time interval between courses , method of administration , and treatment duration , as well as differences in patient population . \n ototoxicity poses a major problem to the cancer patient , as the quality of life after receiving cisplatin chemotherapy may be negatively affected due to hearing loss , resulting in social , emotional , and vocational difficulties , as effective communication is often hindered . \n tasks that normal hearing persons take for granted may become challenging and frustrating . in addition , an individual 's safety may be compromised due to the hearing loss , as appropriate response to alarms and warning signals may be delayed . \n furthermore , a hearing loss may also result in psychosocial and physical health problems , as well as depression and social isolation . \n hence , hearing loss , often referred to as the  invisible condition ,  has serious visible ramifications on the quality of life of a hearing impaired individual . \n this is particularly relevant if the individual has already experienced the hearing world , as the hearing function is never restored to normal , even though patients may benefit from the use of assistive listening devices , such as hearing aids and cochlear implants . \n the impact of an ototoxic hearing loss may be more profound for infants and young children who are at a critical stage of their speech and language development . \n furthermore , the high frequency nature of an ototoxic hearing loss may result in speech recognition and comprehension being compromised , resulting in possible neurocognitive and psychosocial delays . \n there is also an elevated risk for academic learning problems and psychosocial difficulties in school - aged children and adolescents . \n literature indicated that childhood survivors of neuroblastoma had twice the rate of difficulties , as indicated by parent reports , with reading and math skills , and/or attention and a higher risk of a general learning disability than those without a hearing loss . \n there was also poorer self - reported quality of life scores in these children with regard to school functioning . \n hence , cisplatin - associated ototoxicity further complicates the morbidity of cancer patients , as it would also isolate them from family members and significant others at a time when they require the greatest support . \n advancements in medical knowledge and technology , such as screening and early detection of several cancers , have resulted in notable improvements in relative five - year survival rates for cancer [ 64 , 65 ] . \n therefore , improving the quality of life after cisplatin - based chemotherapy becomes increasingly important , and resulting comorbidities such as ototoxicity can be managed appropriately and immediately   if adequate monitoring is in place . \n the nature of ototoxicity is such that it often goes undetected until speech intelligibility is affected   and is usually detected when a communication problem becomes evident . \n communication problems , such as constantly asking for repetition or not responding when spoken to , signify that the hearing loss has progressed to the frequencies important for understanding speech . in this case , \n an audiological monitoring programme can avert , to a large extent , the reduced quality of life as a result of hearing loss , as patients on cisplatin chemotherapy can be identified early , counselled , monitored , and managed appropriately through interventions in a logical , systematic , and coherent manner . \n audiological monitoring should aim to identify the hearing loss early and reduce its impact on the individual 's life by means of proper medical and hearing intervention . \n prospective audiological evaluations remain the only reliable method for detecting ototoxicity before it becomes symptomatic . \n an ototoxicity monitoring programme should involve a health care team comprising of an oncology nurse , oncologists , audiologist , and pharmacist to ensure effective sustainability of such a programme , if implemented , with the patient being the central focus . \n the audiologist is involved in identifying an ototoxic hearing loss , informing the oncologist of such a development , counselling the patient and their family , and prescribing amplification devices , such as hearing aids and cochlear implants . \n early identification of an ototoxic hearing loss provides oncologists with an opportunity to adjust the chemotherapy regimen in order to reduce or prevent further deterioration of hearing . the oncologist and nurses should also counsel patients on the side effects of cisplatin , including ototoxicity , in an attempt to prepare them for treatment outcomes and help them set realistic expectations . \n pharmacists who have access to a patient 's medication list may also alert the oncologists and audiologists to those who are on other ototoxic medication and therefore at a greater risk for cisplatin - induced ototoxicity . \n effective management of such patients using evidence - based practices may improve management of those with cancer , ensuring that they and their families are counselled and appropriate interventions are timeously implemented . \n the principles of early identification and early intervention are a part of ototoxicity monitoring , and the audiologist can manage such a programme . in countries without ototoxicity management guidelines , the  guidelines for the audiological management of individuals receiving cochleotoxic drug therapy  developed by the american association of speech - language - hearing association   may , consequently , guide the audiologist in the implementation of an ototoxicity monitoring programme within a local , regional , or national setting . for widespread acceptance and use , \n ototoxicity monitoring programmes need to incorporate efficient and cost - effective ototoxicity identification techniques , while considering the health care system and demographics of the patient population being managed . \n for any population receiving ototoxic medication , the following should be considered :  ( 1 ) the patient 's level of alertness or ability to respond reliably ; ( 2 ) the most appropriate times during the treatment protocol for test administration , and ; ( 3 ) the test should comprise the baseline , monitoring and post - treatment evaluations  . \n appropriate time intervals for audiological assessments may differ depending on the type of cancer as well as the frequency and dose of cisplatin ( figure 2 ) . \n the audiological assessments should incorporate a detailed case history , otoscopic examination , immittance audiometry , speech audiometry , dpoaes , and conventional and extended high frequency audiometry ( i.e. , up to 20  000  hz ) ( hfa ) [ 69 , 73 ] . these procedures are all conducted for the baseline assessment and the six - month follow - up evaluation [ 69 , 73 ] . while auditory brainstem response may be used , it is not considered a standard procedure for monitoring ototoxicity . monitoring audiological evaluations during treatment and the one- and three - month follow - up evaluations include case interview , otoscopy , and immittance audiometry as well as air conduction pure tone and objective testing . however , full - frequency threshold testing is impractical for many patients on cisplatin chemotherapy , as these individuals are often extremely ill and easily fatigued . the use of abbreviated threshold monitoring procedures that are clinically practical for these patients is therefore recommended . \n one such method involves the use of the sensitive range for ototoxicity ( sro ) . \n this is  the highest frequency with a threshold at or below 100  db spl followed by the next six lower adjacent frequencies in 1/6-octave steps or the one octave range near the highest audible frequency  . \n sro is usually determined during the baseline evaluation and is dependent on each patient 's hearing threshold configuration . during monitoring evaluations \n however , full - frequency testing should be conducted within the same session if an asha significant hearing change is noted within the sro . \n if a patient on cisplatin chemotherapy is still responsive and alert , the protocol presented above would be suitable . \n however , a patient who has limited responsiveness may be required to undergo the same audiological evaluations , except speech audiometry . \n patients who are responsive as well as those who have limited responses can undergo both behavioural and objective testing . however , those patients who are too ill or too young to respond should undergo only objective testing , such as otoscopy , tympanometry , acoustic reflexes , and dpoaes or abrs . while pure tone audiometry in the conventional frequency range is suitable for evaluating hearing in the range responsible for speech understanding , as well as for differential diagnosis , it is less sensitive to detecting early ototoxic change [ 11 , 70 ] . \n the two tests identified as being the most important for the early detection of cisplatin ototoxicity are hfas and oaes , each also having limitations ( see table 4 ) \n . therefore , using each test in isolation may not be as effective as utilizing a test battery approach , as it increases the chances of obtaining reliable audiologic monitoring data over time . \n in addition , these two tests could be used to complement one another in every cycle of chemotherapy to ensure the earliest detection of ototoxicity . the ototoxicity monitoring protocol proposed by \n asha   represents an aggressive and ideal approach for monitoring ototoxicity and is dependent on a country 's infrastructure and resource constraints . \n the asha   guidelines may therefore not be generalized to a country without considering the contextual factors that may influence its applicability to that country . \n however , it does provide guidance towards creating a roadmap that countries , such as south africa , may aspire towards in implementing an ototoxicity monitoring programme . \n similar to india , no programmes have been formally implemented to identify and monitor ototoxicity in patients on cancer chemotherapy in south africa . as a result , there is no contextually relevant research to steer the implementation of an accountable and effective ototoxicity monitoring program in the country . \n this is probably one of the main reasons for ototoxicity monitoring programmes not being commonplace in local hospitals and clinics . \n in addition , the health of south africans is characterized by a quadruple burden of disease , encompassing the occurrence of infectious diseases , the rise of noncommunicable diseases , and perinatal and maternal disorders , as well as injuries and violence , which may result in cancer receiving low priority for health care services . however \n , the creation of an audiological monitoring programme allows for better control of cancer related comorbidities . over the years \n , a number of studies have investigated the use of otoprotectants with cisplatin , their purpose being to protect the inner ear from any injury while not interfering with the antitumor effects of cisplatin . \n otoprotective strategies include reducing the formation of free radicals by maintaining glutathione levels and antioxidant activity . \n three mechanisms may provide protection against cisplatin , these being endogenous molecules , exogenous agents , or a combination of exogenous agents that trigger endogenous protective mechanisms . \n however , endogenous agents are not effective against cisplatin when the dose exceeds a certain threshold [ 17 , 81 ] . \n nearly all of the otoprotective agents are sulfur- or sulfhydryl - containing compounds ( thio compounds ) , known as antioxidants , and potent heavy metal chelators . \n the numerous otoprotective agents utilized in clinical and animal studies include amifostine , d - or l - methionine , methylthiobenzoic acid , lipoic acid , tiopronin , glutathione ester , sodium thiosulfate , melatonin , vitamin e , n - acetylcysteine , dexamethasone , and resveratrol . however \n , none of these agents have been found to be unequivocally beneficial in preventing cisplatin ototoxicity and no agent is currently recommended for routine use . further research is therefore needed to find new methods and optimize old ones to prevent and/or treat hearing loss during cisplatin therapy . \n in addition , intratympanic administration of medication together with gene therapy needs to be further explored . \n intratympanic administration involves the diffusion of the otoprotective agent across the round window into the inner ear , where its therapeutic effect is exerted . \n an advantage of this method of administration is that there are higher concentrations of the otoprotective agent in the inner ear , this being in comparison to the use of oral or parenteral administration , without potentially reducing the efficacy of the cisplatin treatment [ 89 , 90 ] . \n the disadvantage of this procedure , however , is that each ear would have to be treated with a moderately invasive procedure . alternatively \n , gene therapy may prove to be beneficial in protecting an individual against cisplatin - induced hearing loss as several genes , namely , megalin , glutathione - s - transferases , thiopurine s - methyltransferase , and catechol - o - methyl transferase , may be responsible for susceptibility to hearing loss . \n if a cisplatin - associated hearing loss results in communication difficulties , it is the audiologist 's ethical responsibility to begin or recommend aural rehabilitation . \n however , this intervention should not only occur once hearing loss has been detected but before the patient begins the cisplatin chemotherapy . \n aural rehabilitation techniques such as speech reading and counselling on compensatory communication strategies should be conducted . \n the counselling should include spouses and significant other , as hearing loss may not only impact the person with cancer but also frequent communication partners . \n patients with sensorineural hearing loss due to the use of cisplatin may also benefit from the use of assistive listening devices such as hearing aids or cochlear implants . \n children with ototoxic hearing loss may also require the use of personal frequency modulated systems in the classroom . \n furthermore , with the recent developments in hearing aid technology , a patient with an ototoxic hearing loss is more likely to receive the desired amplification benefit . \n these hearing aids are able to amplify sounds at and above 8000  hz . however , there is limited data indicating significant improvements in speech recognition with the use of this technology .hearing aids with frequency lowering technology achieved by linear frequency transposition , nonlinear frequency compression , or spectral envelope warping . \n frequency lowering is used to overcome the limits of either the bandwidth of the device or the functional bandwidth of the ear , by lowering high frequency energy to a region that is more likely to provide and/or benefit from audible sound . \n while there are no published studies suggesting one approach to be superior to another , frequency lowering technology has been found to improve audibility and speech understanding of high frequency sounds . \n commercially available types of frequency lowering signal processing include frequency transposition ( widex ) , nonlinear frequency compression ( phonak ) , and frequency translation ( starkey ) . \n these processors are commercially labelled as audibility extender , soundrecover , and spectral iq , respectively . \n these hearing aids are able to amplify sounds at and above 8000  hz . however , there is limited data indicating significant improvements in speech recognition with the use of this technology . \n hearing aids with frequency lowering technology achieved by linear frequency transposition , nonlinear frequency compression , or spectral envelope warping . \n frequency lowering is used to overcome the limits of either the bandwidth of the device or the functional bandwidth of the ear , by lowering high frequency energy to a region that is more likely to provide and/or benefit from audible sound . \n while there are no published studies suggesting one approach to be superior to another , frequency lowering technology has been found to improve audibility and speech understanding of high frequency sounds . \n commercially available types of frequency lowering signal processing include frequency transposition ( widex ) , nonlinear frequency compression ( phonak ) , and frequency translation ( starkey ) . \n these processors are commercially labelled as audibility extender , soundrecover , and spectral iq , respectively . \n this review has highlighted that cisplatin ototoxicity is a frequent adverse event of cisplatin chemotherapy that may negatively affect the quality of life of patients with cancer . \n the different molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cisplatin - associated ototoxicity highlight the complexity of this condition and the consequent difficulty in identifying an effective otoprotective agent . \n the varying incidence rates reported in both adults and paediatrics may be due to the different audiological tests employed in the monitoring of the cancer patient 's hearing status and therefore highlight the importance of the use of extended high frequency audiometry and dpoaes in ototoxicity monitoring . \n an audiological monitoring programme comprising a team of health care professionals , knowledgeable about cisplatin ototoxicity , may therefore serve to improve evidence - based service delivery to these patients .",
         "cisplatin is an effective drug used in the treatment of many cancers , yet its ototoxic potential places cancer patients , exposed to this drug , at risk of hearing loss , thus negatively impacting further on a patient 's quality of life . \n it is paramount for health care practitioners managing such patients to be aware of cisplatin 's ototoxic properties and the clinical signs to identify patients at risk of developing hearing loss . \n english peer - reviewed articles from january 1975 to july 2015 were assessed from pubmed , science direct , and ebscohost . \n seventy - nine articles and two books were identified for this review , using mesh terms and keywords such as  ototoxicity  ,  cisplatin  ,  hearing loss  , and  ototoxicity monitoring  . \n this review provides an up - to - date overview of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity , namely , its clinical features , incidence rates , and molecular and cellular mechanisms and risk factors , to health care practitioners managing the patient with cancer , and highlights the need for a team - based approach to complement an audiological monitoring programme to mitigate any further loss in the quality of life of affected patients , as there is currently no otoprotective agent recommended routinely for the prevention of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . \n it also sets the platform for effective dialogue towards policy formulation and strengthening of health systems in developing countries .",

relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production . \n chi - squared test was used to evaluate liquid intake versus output production by using spss version 13 . \n descriptive statistics were used to analyse climate data ( temperature ( c ) ; relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production . \n chi - squared test was used to evaluate liquid intake versus output production by using spss version 13 . \n 1 shows in situ hourly climate variation direct from the sugarcane fields while workers harvested the crop . \n as can be seen , temperature and relative humidity values oscillated from 23.5 to 34.5c and from 40% to 64% , respectively , reaching maximum values as early as 810 am . \n this meant that water distribution had to be started at around that time on an hourly basis . \n climate measurements during 160 working hours of follow - up for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n table 2 shows the amount of liquid intake ( including both regular tap water and specially formulated rehydration drinks ) . \n what is of great concern is that , although temperature increased to maximum values early in the morning , many workers did not follow the rehydration measures and drank less than 6 l , a potentially dangerously low volume . \n comparison between temperature measurements and daily water intake for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n this showed that 13 workers who had the highest production output ( range 68 tons , average 7.45 tons ) were those who drank more than 6 l of liquid ( regular tap water and/or specially formulated rehydration solutions ) in comparison to those who drank less liquid and had a smaller production output . \n relationship between production output and daily water intake for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n measurements of heart rate and body weight at the start and end of the working day showed that workers experienced increases in heart rate and loss of body weight as they worked in these hot conditions . \n historically , monitoring of toxins in the work environment has been the primary focus for identifying risks . \n some potential biomarkers linked to cell injury are immunological factors , lymphokines , growth factors , prostaglandins , endothelins , collagen , adhesion molecules , thromboxanes , leukotrienes , platelet activating factors and heat shock proteins ( 10 ) . as mentioned earlier , heat illness is a major cause of preventable morbidity worldwide ( 1 ) and although human beings possess considerable ability to compensate for naturally occurring heat stress , many occupational environments and/or physical activities expose workers to heat loads which are so excessive as to threaten their health and productivity ( 11 ) . \n it is important to remember that the normal human body contains approximately 60% of water , \n the present project evaluated climatic conditions at sugarcane plantations located at sea level , on the southwest coast of nicaragua . \n monitored climate indices ( temperature and relative humidity ) values varied from 23.5 to 34.5c and from 40% to 64% , respectively , reaching maximum values as early as 8 am . according to the nicaraguan institute of territorial studies ( ineter ) ( 13 ) , relative humidity values for the whole month of april varied between 69 and 79% all along nicaragua 's pacific coastline from san juan del sur ( southern region ) to chinandega ( western region ) . \n managua lies between the two regions ; the montelimar sugar farm is located 62 km from managua . \n however , the ineter humidity data are quite different from the relative humidity registered on the farm located in western managua . \n temperature data were not available at ineter 's website . although only 22 subjects were followed - up for a short period of time in this study , important results were obtained . \n other authors have shown the relationship between heat stress health effects and the ability to perform different tasks , as well as the increased risk of suffering work - related injuries ( 14 ) . in this study , the workers drank more liquid as temperature values increased to maximum peaks . \n this was part of a rehydration process which was well planned in advance by the company 's decision makers . unlike during past harvesting seasons , when water and rehydration solutions were distributed quite randomly , during this harvesting season cool water and specially formulated drinks were distributed or intended to be distributed to workers , who received 1 l just before they began their working day and then 500 ml every 30 minutes . \n the basis of this principle is that drinking to satisfy thirst is not enough to keep a person well hydrated . \n most of the people become aware of thirst once they have lost 12 l of body water and persons highly motivated to perform hard work may incur losses of 34 l before serious thirst forces them to stop and drink . \n since dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off - duty hours ( 14 ) . \n there was a significant increase of production , with up to 8 tons per worker during the follow - up period compared to the normal 5.5 tons per worker prior to the change in rehydration measures . \n this important change in rehydration policies and increase in production output is the result of various efforts of training workers , foremen and managers on heat stress prevention , proper hydration measures and quality of ( working ) life carried out by occupational health and safety professionals ( physicians and engineers ) , human resources departments and top management at sugarcane farms . \n . often workers rejected the new rehydration measures , most of the time because it was difficult for them to understand thoroughly the dehydration and physiological compensatory mechanisms . \n some of the reasons for this can be attributed to their low educational level , and feeling that  nothing bad has ever happened to me before , etc . \n certainly more effort in terms of intervention strategies and scientific investigation needs to be carried out among workers in nicaragua who perform jobs in which they are exposed to high ambient temperatures . \n these include farm workers , construction workers , miners and fishermen , especially those employed in the informal sector , which occupies about half of nicaragua 's economically active population . \n more funds should also be designated by companies decision makers for improving basic working conditions , in order to increase overall productivity ( and workers satisfaction in terms of better wages ) . \n this would also translate into safer and healthier workers , less absenteeism from sick leave , fewer accidents and other incidents . \n the author has not received any funding or benefits from industry to conduct this study .",
         "backgroundheat illness is a major cause of preventable morbidity worldwide . \n workers exposed to intense heat can become unable to activate compensation mechanisms , putting their health at risk . \n heat stress also has a direct impact on production by causing poor task performance and it increases the possibility of work - related morbidity and injuries . during the sugarcane harvest period , workers are exposed to excessive sunlight and heat from approximately 6 am to 3 pm . \n a first assessment of heat stress during the 2006/2007 harvesting season served to redesign the existing rehydration measures . in this project , \n sugarcane workers were provided with more rehydration solutions and water during their work schedule.objectiveto assess heat stress preventive measures in order to improve existing rehydration strategies as a means of increasing productivity.methodsa small group of 22 workers were followed up for 15 days during working hours , from 6 am to 3 pm . \n selection criteria were defined : to have worked more than 50% of the day 's working schedule and to have worked for at least 10 days of the follow - up period . \n a simple data recollection sheet was used . \n information regarding the amount of liquid intake was registered . \n production output data was also registered . \n temperature measurements were recorded by using a portable temperature monitoring device (  easylog , model el - usb-2).resultsthe average temperature measurements were above the nicaraguan ministry of labour thresholds . \n seven workers drank 78 l of liquid , improving their production . \n output production increased significantly ( p=0.005 ) among those best hydrated , from 5.5 to 8 tons of cut sugarcane per worker per day.conclusionsproductivity improved with the new rehydration measures . \n awareness among workers concerning heat stress prevention was increased .",

         "choroid plexus papilloma ( cpp ) is a rare benign tumor accounting for 0.5% of all intracranial tumors that is more common in childhood , consisting of 1.5 to 6.4% of pediatric intracranial tumors.1 \n 2 the majority of cpps occur during the first 2 years of life , with 12.5 to 20% ( 10 to 12% ) reported in infants under 1  year of age.1 \n 3 there have been some reports of  calcified cpp ,   cpp in an adult , \n cpp in the cerebellopontine angle ( cpa ) ,  and  atypical form of cpp.4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 however , a case combining with these four features  adult , dense calcification , atypical form , and cpa  is considered to be extremely rare ; such a case has never been encountered among the 8,540 skull base tumors on which the senior author ( t.f . ) has operated in the past 20 years . \n we report an adult case of densely calcified , atypical cpp originated from the cpa without connection to the forth ventricle . \n a 41-year - old man presented with a chief complaint of headache , dizziness , and difficulty with gait that had been gradually worsening for 8 months . \n neurological examination revealed blurred vision , nystagmus with lateral gaze , and mild right facial weakness . \n intermittent difficulty with balance and gait were also present ; however , no motor weakness was observed . \n computed tomography ( ct ) of the head without contrast revealed a high - density multilobular mass in the right cpa causing mass effect and slight ventricular enlargement ( fig . \n magnetic resonance ( mr ) images demonstrated a trilobed solid mass that measured 4.1 cm in maximum diameter ( fig . \n the mass was extra - axial in location and revealed isointensity on both t1-weighted images ( t1-wi ) and t2-weighted images ( t2-wi ) . \n ct and mr images did not reveal any connection between the tumor and the fourth ventricle . \n the surface of the tumor was roughly irregular and looked grayish pink . since the tumor was friable , gelatinous , vascular , and adherent to surrounding structures , it was hard to separate from cranial nerves . \n cranial nerves vi , vii , viii , ix , and x were enveloped in the tumor mass , which included calcification . \n the patient was discharged after recovery from the dysphagia by appropriate rehabilitation . \n computed tomography without contrast revealed a high - density multilobular mass in the right cerebellopontine angle . \n magnetic resonance images demonstrated a trilobed solid mass that was in an extra - axial location . \n the tumor revealed isointensity on both t1-weighted images ( upper left ) and t2-weighted images ( upper right ) . \n homogeneous intense enhancement was identified ( axial in lower left , sagittal in lower right ) . \n cpp reported in this article primarily occurred in the cpa with close proximity to the foramen of luschka lacking continuity of the fourth ventricle . \n the majority of choroid plexus tumors ( cpts ) originate in the ventricular system , 43 to 67% in the lateral ventricle , 24 to 39% in the fourth ventricle , and 9.5 to 11% in the third ventricle , respectively.8 \n 9 the common site of origin differs in each pediatric and adult group . in the pediatric age group , \n 60 to 80% of such tumors occur in the lateral ventricle , especially in the trigone , because the vascular stalk of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle is usually attached to the inferior portion of the trigone . on the other hand , \n most cpp in adults occurs within the fourth ventricle.9 \n 10 \n 11 a small number of the tumors have been reported to be located in extraventricular regions , the cpa , or the cerebellar hemisphere or the suprasellar cistern.8 \n 10 \n 12 cpp within the cpa was first described by cushing in 1917.13 to date , cpp within the cpa has been reported in 7 to 9% of all cpts and is most exclusively found in adults.9 \n 11 \n 14 \n 15 it is divided into two categories according to the origin of the tumor ; one is primary extraventricular cpts and the other is a result of a direct extension of fourth ventricular tumors through the foramen of luschka.15 because the tumor of our case revealed no connection from the fourth ventricle , it is considered to originate from small choroid tufts that normally project from each recess at the foramen luschka into the cpa or from ectopic choroidal islets  unconnected  with the choroid plexus.16 \n  the cpp of our case indicated dense calcification with ventricular enlargement . \n the bulbous tufts extended from the fourth ventricular choroid plexus through the foramen of luschka have been known as the bochdalek flower basket , which could be identified in 75% on ct and 96% on mr imaging.17 calcification of the region was found in 38% on normal imaging anatomy.17 in pathological states , calcification of cpp was reported in 4.1% on plain skull radiographs and 23.8% on ct examinations in patients of all \n 9 the feature of the calcification was commonly described as a stippled or patchy configuration that may include some degrees of hemorrhage.8 \n 9 \n 10 dense calcification was exceptionally reported by sarkar et al.2 the rate of hydrocephalus in association with cpp is 90% and the rate increases up to 100% in malignant cpps.8 the cause of hydrocephalus was considered a combination of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) overproduction ( four to five times that in healthy persons ) , obstruction of csf pathways by the tumor mass , impaired csf absorption , increased protein content of csf around the tumor , subarachnoid scarring or granulations related to recurrent bleeding from the tumor , elevated intraventricular pulse pressure , and adhesions around the exit foramina of the fourth ventricle caused by highly proteinaceous or hemorrhagic csf.2 \n 10 \n 18 the finding of tumor calcification in the cpa generally required consideration of differential diagnosis with papillary or psammomatous meningioma , melanotic schwannoma , and myxopapillary ependymoma . among these tumors , \n association of ventricular enlargement with the finding of calcification might suggest the possible presence of cpts . \n gross total removal was performed in our case of atypical cpp , although the tumor adhered to adjacent structures . in the 2007 world health organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system \n , cpts are classified into cpp as grade i , atypical cpp as grade ii , and choroid plexus carcinoma ( cpc ) as grade iii . among cpts , \n total removal of cpts is recommended and seems to be feasible since a significant prognostic factor was relevant to the extent of tumor removal , and no definitive evidence of the beneficial effect of radiotherapy has been reported6 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 . however , it is not always possible because of tumor bleeding and firm adhesion to adjacent structures , especially cranial nerves . \n the rate of complete resection of benign cpp was 80% and the 5-year survival rate indicated is nearly 100% . \n the majority of survivors are neurologically intact.19 because of the good prognosis , the preservation of cranial nerve functions should be primarily considered in surgery for benign cpp . as for the atypical cpp \n , the rate of total removal was decreased to 50 from 63%.11 \n 21 atypical cpp showed a recurrence rate of 29% , which was much higher than the 6% seen in cpp . \n in addition , seeding within the central nervous system , spontaneous pulmonary metastasis , or rapid regrowth of atypical cpp were also reported.7 \n 22 \n 23 total or gross total removal should be advocated , especially in malignant cpts even though the tumor encases the cranial nerves . \n the finding of calcification in the cpa should suggest the possible presence of cpp , especially if ventricular enlargement is present .",

         "many studies over the past 15 years have focused on discovering solvents that help promote efficient cc bond formation under benign reaction conditions . \n new solvents in dielsalder(2 ) and barbier reactions have been sought to help streamline the one - pot transformations further , reducing synthetic steps and organic waste . \n polar media often accelerate reactions of this type which has led to the use of water as an acceptable solvent for such organic conversions . \n recent contributions from our laboratory to this field have centered on coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes and allyl or propargyl halides under barbier conditions to form homoallylic and homopropargylic propargyl alcohols . \n these compounds find wide use as synthetic templates and show a propensity for oxy - cope rearrangements ( scheme 1 ) . \n the use of -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) , coupled with a propargyl aldehyde should offer an easy route into formation of enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures ( scheme 2 ) . \n previous studies revealed that formation of 2 or 3 under indium - promoted barbier conditions is solvent dependent . \n use of an organic solvent for the coupling reaction results in a mixture of 2 and 3 while the use of water as a solvent yields 2 as the sole product . \n it is possible that water protonates the coupled product to form 2 quickly , quenching the alkoxide intermediate , thereby suppressing the possible oxy - cope pathway shown in scheme 1 . \n it may also be possible that the increased polarity of the solvent itself stabilizes the anion formed upon coupling , thus raising the relative rate of cope rearrangement in this system . with a less polar , aprotic solvent , \n the anion will not be quenched , nor will it be stabilized to the same extent as witnessed in water . \n a combination of these phenomena may be why an oxy - cope rearrangement occurs under less polar conditions , forming product 3 ( scheme 1 ) . \n a coupling reaction between 1 and 4 ( scheme 2 ) was conducted under aqueous conditions to form 2 ( y = sph ) , with good regioselectivity ; however , the rate of this reaction is surprisingly slow . \n although reactions of the type shown in scheme 1 are reported in the literature to be accelerated by polar solvents such as water , coupling reactions between 1 and 4 , as shown in scheme 2 , are quite slow . indeed , \n when water is used as the solvent , reactions often require 1036 h for completion . \n this oil has a density greater than that of water so it is presumed to be an organometallic species formed by interaction of the indium metal with the halide species . \n isolation of the oil followed by workup in an acidic thf / h2o mixture leads to isolation of propargylphenyl sulfide and , to a smaller extent , the aldehyde . \n we surmise that low solubility of this organometallic complex leads to poor reagent mixing , slowing the barbier coupling under aqueous conditions . \n second , indium - promoted coupling reactions conducted in water become more acidic as the reaction proceeds . \n we believe it is possible that the aldehyde is in equilibrium with its corresponding hydrate species , reducing the electrophilicity of the carbon center . \n a combination of these two reasons would lead to a decrease in the rate of reaction between 1 and 4 when conducted in an aqueous solvent . \n the reaction proceeds more quickly ( 812 h ) in dmf , a less polar solvent , due to better solubility of all reagents , however , a mixture of 2 and 3 was isolated . \n it was originally expected that a mixture of water and dmf would lead to faster reaction times while still maintaining regiocontrol of product formation . the use of a water / dmf solvent system , however , resulted in a mixture of products with water constituting up to 50% v / v of the solvent system . \n when water exceeds 50% v / v of the solvent system , only product 2 is isolated , but the rate of reaction slows perceptively once again . to help expedite this reaction sequence , \n we began a search for solvent with polarity similar to , or greater than that of water . \n it was expected that an extremely polar organic solvent would promote the same type of acceleration normally witnessed in barbier couplings carried out under aqueous conditions . \n an organic solvent could also help solubilize the intermediate and reduce possible formation of the hydrate species , thus allowing for a faster coupling reaction to occur . \n if increased polarity stabilizes the anion formed by coupling of 1 and 4 , oxy - cope rearrangement should also be suppressed . with a dielectric constant of 186.9 at 25 c , significantly greater than that of water ( 78.37(7 ) ) , and dmf ( 38.3(7b ) ) , \n n - methylformamide ( nmf ) has found occasional use in previous reactions requiring polar organic solvents ; however , it has historically found more widespread use as an organic reagent . with a pka of approximately 24,(7d ) \n nmf is reactive under a range of organometallic reagent conditions , limiting its use as a solvent . \n indium - promoted coupling reactions , however , have been shown to be accelerated under aqueous conditions,(1 ) and the relative acidity of nmf , being higher than that of water , should not hinder the proposed barbier couplings proposed within this paper . \n we were especially intrigued by the fact that the dielectric constant of nmf increases to 220 as the temperature is lowered from 25 to 0 c . \n we were interested in examining what effect the increase in dielectric constant at lower temperature could have on a barbier - style reaction of the type shown in scheme 2 among others . \n this paper reports on the use of nmf in barbier - style reactions with a focus on rates of reaction , stereochemistry , and its use to form enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures.(9 ) \n although nmf has characteristics similar to those of dmf , it also has characteristics similar to water , such as a polar xh bond.(7 ) thus , having found a very polar solvent with properties similar to both water and organic systems , we hypothesized that the 1,2-coupling product could be formed in high yield under short reaction times . \n a series of reactions was set up to test this hypothesis . as shown in table 1 , use of either water or \n nmf resulted in formation of the 1,2-product ( 2 ) solely with no trace of 3 detected in the product mixture . \n although the yield of product was moderate to high in either solvent , product formation in reactions conducted in nmf proceeded at a much greater rate . \n we believe that there are two possible reasons behind the rate increase of coupling reactions carried out in nmf . \n the ratio of reagent was as follows : 1.0:1.5:1.1 ( aldehyde / halide / indium ) . \n the reaction was run at 0.1 m with respect to indium . in the lewis acid catalyzed reaction , 10 molar % of the lewis acid was used . \n all species completely dissolved in nmf , unlike what was observed for reactions in water . as such , we believe mixing is much more efficient , allowing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate . \n has also been noted in many literature examples to lead to rate enhancement in indium - promoted barbier reactions . \n we believe a mixture of better solubility coupled with greater solvent polarity results in an additive effect toward increasing the rate of reactions conducted in nmf when compared to water . \n h - bonding capabilities of nmf may explain the greater regioselectivity for reactions conducted in nmf when compared to those observed in dmf and thf ; however , the h - bonding capacity of nmf is much lower than that of water.(7d ) increased solvent polarity , thus increasing the stability of the intermediate anion and raising the relative energy of the oxy - cope rearrangement , may seem more likely at this time . in an effort to exclude the solvent as a direct participant in intermediate formation when nmf is used , nmr spectroscopy studies were performed to determine if a possible hemiaminal or imminium species was forming in situ ( figure 1 ) . \n the imminium functionality carries a positive charge and would increase the electrophilicity of the reactive carbon . \n mixing of 1 and nmf under sonication for periods of up to 24 h , however , revealed the presence of only 1 and nmf by nmr spectroscopy . possible formation of hemiaminal or imminium species . the presence or absence of a lewis acid has shown to help control stereoselectivity in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions . \n previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the addition of indium(iii ) chloride as a lewis acid favors formation of the syn - product in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions between 4 and aldehyde functional groups . in the absence of the lewis acid , \n the anti - product is favored ( figure 2).(5b ) it was our hope that similar effects would be witnessed in the present system , especially while using nmf as the reaction solvent , and we were pleased to see this trend continue . \n absence of a lewis acid in the reagent mixture favored a nonchelated pathway , leading to formation of anti-2 . \n use of indium chloride to control stereochemistry.(5b ) the presence of a lewis acid in the reaction mixture favored a chelated pathway , leading to formation of syn-2 ( figure 3 ) . \n diastereoselectivities were determined either by direct measurement of vicinal coupling constants in the hydroxyl sulfide or by corresponding conversion to the epoxide compounds as shown in figure 4.(11 ) general j values for hydroxyl sulfides and epoxide structures . \n entries 1 , 5 , and 13 ( table 1 ) describe reactions run in nmf in the absence of a lewis acid . \n good anti - selectivity is witnessed with ratios as high as 15:85 ( syn / anti ) . in all cases , with \n the exception of r = phenyl , systems , with and without incl3 , run in nmf gave better selectivity than systems run in water . \n both systems showed poor selectivity when r = tms for reasons of which we are not quite sure . when incl3 was added as a lewis acid , the chelated route was favored in ratios as high as 90:10 ( syn : anti , entry 15 ) . \n n - methylformamide was shown to increase the rate of reaction compared with water and offered better stereocontrol in the systems studied . \n enediyne and epoxydiyne functionalities contain either a ( z)-3-ene-1,5-diyne or ( z)-3-epoxy-1,5-diyne unit which leads to their noted activity.(9 ) these unique functional groups cyclize to form a p - benzyne- or p - benzyne - like intermediate that interacts with dna by abstracting hydrogen.(9 ) the dna diradical then either couples with itself , or cleaves , stopping replication . \n natural product enediyne and epoxydiynes have found use as anticarcinogenic compounds.(9 ) this area of study is slowed , however , by complicated access into the skeletal systems required.(9 ) literature procedures that find use in epoxy alkyne formation such as halohydrin cylization,(12)m - cpba,(13 ) or oxone(14 ) have been shown to be successful , but limited examples are known with these systems at present . under the barbier coupling conditions described in this paper , formation of compound 2 offers an efficient and controlled method for the formation of either an enediyne or epoxydiyne skeletal structure under benign conditions by allowing easy conversion to either the cis - epoxydiyne ( from syn-2 , scheme 3 ) or the cis - enediyne ( from anti-2 , scheme 4 ) . \n facile synthesis of epoxydiyne and enediyne functional groups under the reported conditions would allow for their use as template structures in organic synthesis , opening access to more sophisticated units for further exploration . in the following pages , we describe the transformation of 1 into either an epoxydiyne ( 5 ) or enediyne ( 6 ) skeletal structure in two steps with high regio- and stereocontrol using nmf as a new solvent to form 2 under barbier conditions , followed by a one - step transformation to yield either 5 or 6 . as shown in scheme 3 , syn-2 can adopt the correct conformation to form a cis - oxirane upon reaction with either me3obf4 or tloet . \n conversion of the hydroxy sulfide starting material ( 2 ) to the epoxyalkyne product ( 5 ) was quite successful as shown in table 2 . in all cases , \n this fact is worth mentioning as barbier reactions with propargyl halides can lead to rearrangement of the organometallic intermediate into an allenyl product . \n reagent 4 has been previously shown to offer one of the few examples of a barbier reaction with a propargyl halide where rearrangement does not occur.(5b ) use of tloet(17 ) gave yields similar to that of me3obf4(18 ) in all cases of oxirane formation , with stereoselectivity preserved under both sets of conditions . \n use of the anti-2 allows formation of the ( e)-alkene ( the alkyne functional groups are cis to each other ) functional group by the pathway shown in scheme 4 . \n formation of the enediyne product was possible under slightly acidic conditions . a catalytic amount of p - tsoh is added to anti-2 in a mixture of water and thf ( 10% water ) with stirring for 37 h. the reaction was also conducted under basic conditions after transformation of the oh group to a tosylate . \n yields were quite low under basic conditions , presumably due to the competing acidity of the alkynyl proton , leading to decomposition and side product formation . due to low yields , \n results of the acid - catalyzed conversion of anti-2 to ( e)-6 are shown in table 3 . \n a slight amount of isomerization was witnessed under acidic conditions ( about 3% of the product mixture ) , but overall , good stereocontrol was realized in these conversions , allowing for easy entry into the cis - enediyne ( ( e)-alkene ) skeletal structure in a two - step sequence . \n the assignment of e- and z - isomers was made by comparison of the -vinyl proton shift . \n alignment of the -vinyl proton and the heteroatom cis to each other gives rise to a lower field proton resonance than trans alignment of these two groups ( figure 5).(19 ) the assignments for the enediyne products are compared correctly with the stereochemistry of compounds 2 and 3 within this study . \n coupled with the original indium - promoted barbier reaction , the transformation of starting materials 1 and 4 into enediyne or epoxydiyne compounds proceeded in two steps in an overall 6080% overall yield , offering an efficient , benign , and good - yielding formation of these important skeletal structures . \n the use of n - methylformamide is shown to be a nice alternative to aqueous conditions in indium promoted coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes ( 1 ) and -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) . \n this paper introduces the use of nmf as s viable solvent in a barbier coupling reaction , revealing increased rates and better selectivity when compared to reactions conducted in water and other organic solvents . \n the increased efficiency of the barbier coupling reaction as described in this paper allows for facile formation of epoxy - and enediyne skeletal structures in an overall two - step procedure . \n the introduction of nmf as an alternative solvent in barbier reactions will open new pathways to organic synthetic chemists . further studies to test other halides and aldehyde functional groups under barbier coupling reaction conditions in nmf are currently underway and will be reported in due time . \n tetrahydrofuran was purified by distillation under an argon atmosphere

         "osseointegrated implants are a practical alternative to traditional prosthodontics ; however , designing an implant - supported prosthesis with function and esthetics is a challenge . \n malaligned implants often complicate the clinical laboratory procedures employed for fabrication of superstructures . due to improper load distribution , \n a stent is an appliance used for radiographic evaluation of height and width of the available bone during treatment planning for implant placement or during surgical procedures to provide site for optimum implant placement . \n the variable type of stents includes vaccuform or acrylic resin templates adapted over duplicated casts of diagnostic wax - up . \n these include plastic or metal tubes and channels in acrylic resin that dictate the position of implants . \n stents should be made of transparent material , stable and rigid when in position , should cover enough teeth to stabilize its position , and when no teeth are present , stents should extend onto unreflected soft tissue regions . with the use of computed tomography ( ct ) and computer added designing ( cad)/ computer added machining ( cam ) technology \n , it is now possible to construct a surgical implant stent that would allow the clinician to predetermine implant locations virtually and surgically place them without reflecting a tissue flap.[58 ] but the surgical stents prepared with ct and cad / cam technology are very much more cost effective than a conventional surgical stent and require enough time and special center and/or laboratories for their fabrication and later on their correction , if required . in this study \n , we used the conventional surgical stents to evaluate their efficacy in determining the position and diameter of implants . \n the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and clinical precision of conventional surgical stent protocol for optimum installation of dental implants in terms of position and diameter . \n the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and clinical precision of conventional surgical stent protocol for optimum installation of dental implants in terms of position and diameter . \n the study was conducted in the out - patient department of prosthodontics and dental material sciences in collaboration with department of oral and maxillofacial surgery , faculty of dental sciences , csmmu , lucknow . \n patients were treated in this study with the conventional surgical stents ; all the implants were placed to the desired depth as planned in virtual implant planning . \n all the patients ( 45 patients for whom 89 implants were placed at different sites ) [ figures 1 , 2 ] visiting the department of prosthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery for implant supported prosthesis placement and who followed the standard inclusion criteria for placement of implants were included in the study . \n first of all , diagnostic cast of the patients was made and acrylic teeth / tooth were waxed - up [ figure 3 ] . then , the impression of that waxed - up cast was taken and poured to reproduce another cast with the missing teeth / tooth replaced by dental stone . \n then , mesiodistal and buccolingual markings were drawn over these teeth / tooth to find a center point on the occlusal surface [ figure 4 ] . \n later on , after applying the separating media over these regions and filling the undercuts with wax , transparent self - curing material was applied at the teeth to be replaced along with some adjacent area antero - posteriorly , which confers the stability to the stent during implant placement [ figure 5 ] . \n the holes were drilled in the stent so formed at the center point for the assessment of the diameter and position of implant and filled with gutta percha [ figure 6 ] . \n this stent was placed in the mouth and radiograph was taken to evaluate the position of gutta percha . \n the efficacy of stents was then evaluated at the time of surgical exposure for implant placement and after the surgery , with the help of radiographs [ figures 7 , 8 ] . \n intraoral view of the patient radiograph of the patients waxed - up missing teeth missing teeth replaced by dental stone in the cast with markings stent made of transparent material stent in place with gutta percha filled in holes post - operative radiograph philip j. described a technique to construct a surgical guide on mounted diagnostic casts . \n he also used these mounted casts to determine whether sufficient space exists for a fixed cantilevered implant prosthesis . \n murat c cehreli suggested the fabrication of a bilaminar dual - purpose stent that facilitates implant placement with improved verification of implant positioning . \n the outer lamina is designed for use in the computed tomography ( ct ) evaluation using radiopaque markers . \n yen - chen ku presented a simple method of fabricating a vacuum - formed matrix filled with clear acrylic resin and a gutta - percha marker . \n the matrix can be used as not only a radiopaque marker for evaluation but also a surgical guide during the surgical stage for single implant therapy . \n roger a. solow showed that a radiographic - surgical template can facilitate consultation with a surgeon and patient , when implant - supported restorations are planned . a template that provides radiographic evaluation of the implant site and precise or modified surgical placement \n kivanc akea described a modified surgical stent that serves as a guide to proper mesiodistal paralleling of dental implants . \n he also used these mounted casts to determine whether sufficient space exists for a fixed cantilevered implant prosthesis . \n murat c cehreli suggested the fabrication of a bilaminar dual -

surgical healing , fewer post - operative complications and increased comfort and satisfaction for the patient . \n the possibility of displacement of stent during implant surgery was minimized by extension of the stent antero - posteriorly to cover enough area over the teeth / tooth present adjacent to edentulous area . in cases where no teeth are present , \n stabilization of stent was achieved by extending it over the unreflected areas like retromolar regions . \n this study shows the extreme accuracy of this conventional surgical stent . if each step of this protocol is followed precisely , it is possible to deliver an optimum implant installation in terms of position and diameter and later on function at a very much reduced rate and time , as taken in ct and cad / cam technology which are the most accepted methods",
         "aim : demand from implant patients for quality and efficient treatment is increasing . \n fortunately dental implant treatment is evolving with patients expectations.materials and methods : the study comprised of 45 patients for whom 89 implants were placed at different sites . \n efficacy of the stents is evaluated in determining the position and diameter of the implants.conclusion:this study shows the extreme accuracy of this surgical stents in implant installation in terms of position and diameter .",

         "type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic -cells , primarily mediated by t lymphocytes , resulting in insulin deficiency and lifelong exogenous insulin dependence ( 1 ) . \n latent autoimmune diabetes in adults ( lada ) is a subtype of autoimmune diabetes , but the progression of autoimmune -cell destruction is slow ; therefore , patients with lada are not insulin dependent at the initial phase ( at least 6 months ) of disease onset \n . clinical manifestation of lada shares the features of classical t1d and type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) ( 2 ) . t1d , lada , and t2d present a spectrum of diabetes . \n they range from patients with classic childhood t1d characterized by autoimmune - mediated destruction of -cells with the lowest c - peptide levels to age - related exacerbation of glucose tolerance with the highest bmi seen in t2d ( 3 ) . \n furthermore , patients with lada have susceptibility genes for both t1d and t2d ( 4 ) , suggesting that lada lies between t1d and t2d . \n b cells infiltrate the islets of young nod mice , the commonly used mouse model for human t1d , and play a role in the initiation of -cell destruction by the autoimmune response ( 5 ) . \n studies have shown that marginal zone b ( mzb ) cells and follicular b ( fob ) cells can effectively activate cd4 t cells and facilitate their proliferation by serving as important antigen - presenting cells , especially as antigen - specific antigen - presenting cells ( 6,7 ) . \n b - cell  targeted therapy has been shown to delay the fall of c - peptide levels in patients with recent - onset t1d ( 8) . \n clinical trials have identified b cells as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and reversal of t1d . \n b - cell  targeted therapy also has been successfully used in treating other autoimmune diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis ( 9 ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( 10 ) , and multiple sclerosis ( 11 ) . \n moreover , studies have shown that b cells are important in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity ( 12 ) . a subset of b cells expressing cd19cd5cd1d , which have a regulatory function in infection , inflammation , and autoimmune disease , recently has been identified . \n these regulatory b cells can regulate t - cell responses and inhibit inflammation in an interleukin-10 ( il-10)dependent manner ( 1316 ) . \n the maturation and expansion of b10 cells require il-21 and cd40 signals both in vivo and ex vivo ( 17,18 ) . \n considerable evidence shows that patients with autoimmune diabetes have altered frequencies of circulating immune cells , including t cells ( 19 ) , dendritic cells ( 20 ) , natural killer cells ( 21,22 ) , and neutrophils ( 23 ) . \n although studies have reported no significant change in total b cells in peripheral blood of patients with t1d ( 21,24 ) , little is known about b - cell subpopulations with distinct immune functions that may play a role in the diabetes spectrum of t1d , lada , and t2d . \n we hypothesized that an altered phenotype of b - cell subsets is associated with autoimmune diabetes . \n this study investigated a change of peripheral b - cell subsets in patients with t1d , lada , and t2d compared with healthy control subjects . \n the results show altered frequencies of various b - cell subsets associated with autoimmune diabetes . \n two hundred fifty - eight patients with t1d ( n = 81 , mean diabetes duration 3.1  3.5 years ) , lada ( n = 82 , 6.1  5.9 years ) , or t2d ( n = 95 , 3.0  3.7 years ) and 218 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance ( ngt ) ( table 1 ) were enrolled in the current study from the second xiangya hospital of central south university ( changsha , hunan , china ) . \n diabetes was diagnosed according to world health organization ( who ) criteria ( 25 ) . \n diagnosis of t1d was based on acute - onset ketosis or ketoacidosis with immediate insulin replacement therapy ;

however , we did not find a negative correlation between total b cells and age , as previously reported ( 24,31 ) . \n the current study went further than the examination of the frequency of total b cells , focusing on b - cell subsets with distinct immunological functions . \n of note , we found that patients with t1d or lada had an increased frequency of mzb cells but decreased frequency of fob cells compared with control subjects with ngt and patients with t2d . in all groups , we found that fcp was negatively associated with mzb cells but positively associated with fob cells . \n attanavanich and kearney ( 6 ) reported that mzb cells were more effective at activating naive cd4 t cells than fob cells . \n mzb cells in nod mice were also shown to be important antigen - presenting cells for the activation of t cells in pancreatic - draining lymph nodes ( 32 ) . given the negative correlation between mzb cells and fcp , it is possible that mzb cells may promote -cell destruction in patients with t1d or lada . \n decreased frequency of fob cells in the circulation of patients with t1d and lada suggests that some fob cells migrated from the blood to the pancreas or the draining lymph nodes as a result of the local inflammatory response . \n along with the disease progression , more immune cells are known to infiltrate to the islets of both nod mice and patients with t1d ( 5,33 ) , but the patients with t1d in the current study have a relatively long history of diabetes ( 3.1 years ) . \n thus , fob cells appear to be more important in initial rather than established pancreatic -cell autoimmunity ( 34 ) . \n we showed that patients with t2d and lada more frequently had t2-mzp b cells than control subjects with ngt , which associates with parameters of blood pressure , lipidemia , and glycemia but not with hba1c or fcp . \n these observations are consistent with a previous study showing that glycemia and lipidemia are associated with immune cells ( 35 ) . another interesting finding was the decrease of b10 cell frequency in all types of diabetes , being the lowest in t1d . \n whether this phenotype is mediated through a common mechanism or different ones is not clear . \n what is clear is that immune mechanisms are involved and that more studies , especially functional studies , are required . \n although b cells are generally acknowledged for their function in humoral immune response by producing antibodies , they also have been demonstrated to play an immunoregulatory role in the prevention of autoimmune disease by producing il-10 and downregulating t - cell responses ( 13,14,36 ) . \n the observed b10 cell reduction could contribute to the breakdown of self - tolerance that leads to -cell destruction in patients with t1d ( 24 ) or lada . \n antigen - activated il-10producing b cells may selectively inhibit autoreactive t - cell responses to islet - specific antigen to maintain self - tolerance , and hyperglycemic nod mice and patients with t1d lack this population of regulatory b cells ( 37 ) . \n in the clinical trial where b cells in patients with new - onset t1d were depleted , the patients showed a transient remission ( 8) . \n however , blanket targeting of all b cells , as used in the clinical trial and in treating other autoimmune disorders , needs to be improved by selectively deleting pathogenic b cells while preserving regulatory b cells to promote tolerance . \n our preclinical study showed that more regulatory b cells were regenerated after b - cell deletion in an animal model ( 38 ) . \n furthermore , studies have shown that patients with long - standing t2d could have a secondary autoimmune response toward islet -cells ( 39 ) . \n the reduction of b10 regulatory cells might contribute to the dysregulation of immune response in t2d . \n a functional study on il-10producing b cells and further phenotyping will be the goal of future work . in the current study , \n although we currently can not identify a specific subset that could be used for diagnostic purposes , the results strongly imply that the change of b - cell subtypes is related to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes . \n therefore , it is important to reconsider the approach of b - cell  targeted therapy in patients with t1d and aim to selectively remove pathogenic b cells but promote regulatory b cells . in summary , \n the current data demonstrate distinct differences in the frequencies of peripheral b - cell subsets in t1d and lada , which are associated with islet function and glycemia . \n the findings support the notion that these immunological alterations are involved in loss of self - tolerance and -cell destruction . \n the findings also suggest that , similar to regulatory t - cell therapy , transfusion of ex vivo expanded autologous b10 cells might open a new and effective therapeutic strategy in treating autoimmune diabetes . \n ",
         "objectiveb lymphocytes play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes . \n we hypothesized that the altered b - cell subset phenotype is associated with autoimmune diabetes.research design and methodspatients with type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) ( n = 81 ) , latent autoimmune diabetes in adults ( lada ) ( n = 82 ) , or type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) ( n = 95 ) and healthy control subjects ( n = 218 ) with normal glucose tolerance ( ngt ) were recruited . \n we determined the percentage of circulating b - lymphocyte subsets , including cd19+cd23cd21 + ( marginal zone b [ mzb ] ) , cd19+cd23+cd21 ( follicular b [ fob ] ) , and cd19+cd5+cd1dhi ( interleukin-10producing regulatory b [ b10 ] ) cells by flow cytometry.resultspatients with t1d or lada had increased percentages of mzb cells and decreased percentages of fob cells compared with healthy control subjects with ngt and patients with t2d . \n moreover , patients with t1d showed the lowest frequency of b10 cells compared with patients with lada or t2d , whereas healthy control subjects expressed the highest frequency of b10 cells . \n of note , the frequency of mzb cells was negatively associated and the frequency of fob cells was positively associated with fasting c - peptide ( fcp ) . \n the frequency of b10 cells was positively correlated with fcp and negatively correlated with hemoglobin a1c.conclusionsthe data show that patients with t1d or lada express an altered frequency of b - cell subsets , which is associated with islet function and glycemia . \n these findings suggest that b lymphocytes may be involved in loss of self - tolerance and -cell destruction and could be used as a biomarker and potential target for immunological intervention .",

         "according to numerous estimations , 15% to 29% of patients with cataract have 1.5 diopters ( d ) of refractive astigmatism.1,2 cataract surgeons usually prefer to treat cataract and correct refractive ( spherical and astigmatic ) disorders at the time of the surgery . \n corneal incision ( astigmatic keratotomy ) and peripheral corneal relaxing incisions ( pcris ) were performed to treat these disorders.3,4 the main drawbacks of these approaches are that the outcome depends on multiple factors as the patient s age , the depth and length of the incision , complications related to wound healing , epithelial defects , or induction of dry - eye symptoms . \n these parameters affect the visual outcome in a unpredictable way so the corneal incisions are not considered a reliable method for astigmatism correction . \n toric intraocular lens ( iols ) implantation was introduced in the 1990 s as an option for astigmatism correction in cataract patients . \n initially they presented the disadvantage of postoperative rotation that decreased the visual outcome.58 new toric iol designs ( acrysof   toric iol ; alcon , fort worth , tx ) , approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) at the end of 2005 , have been found to be more stable and appear to be the preferred iol for correcting preexisting astigmatism in conjunction with cataract surgery.9,10 the acrysof   iols are available in three options : t3 , t4 , and t5 of astigmatic correction 1.5 , 2.25 , 3.00 d , respectively ( at the iol plane ) . \n the aim of this study is to report the clinical results of acrysof   toric iols implantation for preexisting astigmatism correction and compare the postoperative rotation of the iols one and six months postoperatively . \n this prospective study included eyes that had cataract surgery at the papageorgiou general hospital , thessaloniki , greece , between may 2008 and december 2008 . \n the study was conducted according to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and patients gave informed consent after the nature and intent of the study had been fully explained to them . \n inclusion criteria were : cataract , age 70 years or younger , and preoperative regular corneal astigmatism greater than 1.00 d. exclusion criteria were : glaucoma , corneal disease , previous corneal or intraocular surgery , macular degeneration or retinopathy , and history of ocular inflammation . \n each patient had a complete ophthalmologic examination , including visual acuity ( va ) , slit - lamp examination , intraocular pressure ( iop ) measurement , and dilated fundus examination . \n topography ( magellan mapper ; nidek technologies , padova , italy ) , automated refractometry ( rk600 ; reichert , inc . \n , depew , ny ) , and ultrasonic immersion biometry ( ocuscan rxp ; alcon ) were performed to determine the appropriate iol spherical power . \n cylindrical power and axis placement to achieve emmetropia were calculated using an online toric iol calculator program ( available from http://www.acrysoforiccalculator.com/ ) . \n the 0180 axis was marked with the patient in a sitting position to avoid cyclotorsion using the nuijts / lane preoperative toric reference corneal marker ( ae-2791tbl ; asico , westmont , il ) ( figure 1 ) . \n intraoperatively , the desired implantation axis was marked using an intra - op toric axis marker ii ( ae-2794 ; asico ) ( figure 2 ) . \n a foldable iol was implanted in the capsular bag through a 2.75 mm limbal incision on 110. the toric iol was injected with a monarch - ii injector ( alcon ) and placed around 1015 off axis before the ophthalmic viscosurgical device ( sodium hyaluronate 1% ) was removed . \n after ophthalmic viscosurgical device removal , the iol was rotated to its final position by exactly aligning the toric reference marks with the limbal implantation axis marks . \n all surgeries were performed by the same experienced surgeon ( it ) using topical anesthesia and a standard divide - and - conquer phacoemulsification technique . because of the intraoperative marker design and the pen mark fading during the operation in several cases , it was difficult to assess the proper alignment of the iol after its placement . because of this difficulty , an image was captured from the real - time streaming recording of the surgery and was assessed blindly by a second operator using a commercially available software ( screen protractor ; iconico , ny , usa ) ( unpublished data ) . to overcome this difficulty we consider that the use of the marker set consisting of beveled degree gauge ( ae-1590 ; asico ) and maloney astigmatism axis marker ( ae-2741 ; asico ) is more appropriate for the whole procedure because it allows maximum visibility . \n the on - screen assessment of the axis remains a useful tool for postoperative evaluation of the iol location ( figure 3 ) . \n measurements of visual acuity ( using the snellen opto - type at a six - meter distance ) , iop , and comprehensive slit lamp examination were performed at one - day and one- and six - month postoperative visits . at the one- and six - month follow - up \n , a digital photograph and corneal topography ( only at the one - month visit ) were obtained to estimate the postoperative rotation of the iol using the software tools mentioned above ( figure 1 ) . \n outcomes of interest included uncorrected va , cylindrical astigmatism power before and after iol implantation , and the possible rotation of the iol one and six months after the operation ( when the initial desired place was at 0 ) . \n absolute values of the rotation used for the analysis after detecting rotation was not under investigation . \n completed data forms were analyzed with microsoft excel 2007 ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa ) and spss software ( version 16.0 ; spss inc . , chicago , il ) . \n twenty - nine eyes of 19 patients ( mean age 63.03  5.42 years ) were enrolled in this study . \n uncorrected va was found to be 5/10 or more in 26 of 29 eyes ( 89.7% ) and 8/10 or more in 19 of 29 patients ( 65.5% ) . \n preoperative and postoperative corneal topography showed significant reduction of refractive astigmatism in all eyes after the surgery . \n mean power of the astigmatism was 2.38  0.91 d ( range 1.55 d ) preoperatively and 0.64  0.61 d ( range 02.5 d ) postoperatively ( figure 4 ) . \n one month postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.2  1.5 ( range 0.67.8 ) . \n six months postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.7  1.5 ( range 0.98.4 ) . \n the later rotation occurred between one and six months , and was found to be more than one degree ( 1.1 ) only in one eye ( 3% ) and in all other cases was less than this value ( figure 5 ) . \n it is known that one degree of deviation causes 3.3% reduction of the iol cylindrical power . \n calculated reduction of the desired correction ( in diopters ) because of the observed rotation ( mean value , one and two standard deviations ) for the three iol models is shown in table 1 . \n no eye had secondary surgery to reposition the iol axis within the six - month postoperative period . \n the results of our study corroborate previous studies,11 which demonstrates that proper selection and preoperative examination of patients followed by uncomplicated iol implantation of one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols results in acceptable stability and visual outcome . \n in particular , the postoperative rotation of toric iols appears to occur in the early postoperative period ( 1 month ) and remains constant later than six months . \n the lens rotates until a fibronectin and collagen adhesion develops between the iol and the posterior capsule , which prevents any further rotary motion.12 the amount of cylindrical correction reduction due to postoperative rotation was not large enough13 to affect the expected end result in final uncorrected distance va . \n acrysof   one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols implantation shows satisfactory stability , acceptable clinical results , and is an exceptional option for correction of refractive astigmatism .",

         "song is a complex , learned motor skill that involves the precise coordination of vocal and respiratory musculature in order to produce highly stereotyped renditions of a memorized song model . \n two pathways contributed to this behavior are identified in the songbird forebrain : the motor pathway that is required throughout life for normal song production , and the anterior forebrain pathway ( afp ) which is necessary for song learning and plasticity [ 13 ] . \n hvc ( used as the proper name ) is the beginning nucleus of both pathways and projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( ra ) and afp . \n the motor pathway is from hvc to ra , and then ra projects to brainstem nuclei controlling the vocal and respiratory muscles . during song , ra neurons in adult birds generate a highly stereotyped sequence of bursts [ 5 , 6 ] and also receive input from lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium ( lman ) , the output nucleus of afp . \n notably , recordings from lman neurons projecting to ra revealed highly variable spiking activity across song renditions , suggesting that lman may act as a source of variability . \n these results indicate that synaptic activity in lman - ra synaptic transmission is crucial to song plasticity [ 8 , 9 ] , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . it has been observed that ra received excitatory glutamatergic inputs from hvc and lman . \n the former is mediated by a mixture of n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) and -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic - acid- ( ampa- ) type receptors [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] , and the latter is mediated almost exclusively by nmda - type receptors . \n lman - ra synaptic transmission is necessary for the variability of song in adult zebra finch , suggesting that the activity of nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses might induce the activity pattern change of ra neurons and change the bursts that control the vocal and respiratory muscles . \n the control of gain , which refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input , is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions [ 1215 ] . \n gain control is achieved through a divisive process and is observed as a change in the slope of the input - output relationship . \n such gain changes are frequently observed in the responses of cortical neurons and are thought to play an important role in neural computations . \n modulations of gain have been observed in the enhancement of neural responses by attention [ 12 , 16 ] and can also be induced pharmacologically . in a neuron model , \n nmda receptors caused such membrane potential fluctuations between a hyperpolarized down - state and a depolarized up - state , which may gate the information and gain modulation . \n here , we test the gain change of ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to selectively activate nmda receptors , using whole - cell current clamp recording in adult male zebra finch slices . \n brain slices were prepared from adult male zebra finches ( taeniopygia guttata ) ( > 90 days old ) obtained from commercial suppliers as previously described [ 19 , 20 ] . \n brains were dissected into ice - cold , oxygenated ( 95% o2 and 5% co2 ) slice solution . \n slice solution consists of ( in mm ) sucrose 248 , kcl 5 , nahco3   28 , glucose 10 , mgso47h2o 1.3 , and nah2po4h2o 1.26 [ 21 , 22 ] . \n coronal brain slices ( 250  m thick ) containing ra were cut with a vibrating microtome ( ma752 , usa ) and collected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) that had been warmed to 37c and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature . \n slices were allowed to recover in the holding chamber for at least 1.5  h and were equilibrated to room temperature before recordings were made . \n standard acsf consists of ( in mm ) nacl 125 , nahco3 25 , nah2po4h2o 1.27 , kcl 2.5 , mgso47h2o 1.2 , cacl2   2.0 , and glucose 25 and was adjusted with sucrose to a final osmolarity of 350  mos . for recording , \n a slice was transferred to a submerge - type chamber where it was continuously exposed to acsf , saturated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 at room temperature ( 2226c ) at the rate of 2.0  ml / min . \n ra and the surrounding tissues were distinguishable under bx51wi microscope connected with a dic - ir video camera ( olympus , japan ) . at high magnification ( 40x ) , ra neurons were visualized and the recordings were made from healthy cells . \n recording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass ( sutter instruments , usa ) using a flaming - brown puller ( model p-97 , sutter instruments , usa ) and were filled with the pipette solution containing ( in mm ) : k meso4   120 , nacl 5 , hepes 10 , egta 2 , mg - atp 2 , and na3-gtp 0.3 ( ph 7.3 - 7.4 , and 340  mos ) . \n the recording pipettes , which had resistances ranging from 3 to 5  m , were positioned using an integrated motorized control system ( sutter instruments , usa ) . \n the potential changes after application of nmda were corrected during the input - output stimulation protocols . \n the series resistance ( rs ) , between 15  m and 30  m , was compensated using the bridge balance . \n all agents were applied by changing the bath perfusate from standard acsf to modified acsf in which various drugs were simply added . unless indicated otherwise , \n the clampfit 9.2 ( axon instruments , usa ) , mini 6.0 ( synaptosoft inc . , fort lee , nj , usa ) , and originpro 8.0 ( originlab , nothampton , ma , usa ) were used for analysis . \n events with peak amplitude of 50  mv or higher and a rise time of about 0.5  ms were detected automatically , and the results were analyzed with origin pro 8.0 . \n the steady - state spike rate was estimated by counting the number of spikes in 1 second , and the result was plotted versus the intensity of the injected current ( f - i relationship ) . \n the slope of the f - i relationship ( referred to as gain ) was estimated by linear fitting . \n slope parameters were estimated separately for individual neurons and that figures 4 and 5 contain mean slope values averaged for the whole groups of neurons . \n the amplitude of ahp was quantified as the difference between spike threshold and the lowest point of ahp . throughout \n means were compared using paired two - tailed student 's t - test or one - way anova followed by scheffe 's multiple comparison . \n stable whole - cell recordings were obtained in 160  ra projection neurons from 51 adult male zebra finches . \n a neuron with the resting membrane potential < 50  mv and an overshooting action potential was considered viable . \n ra projection neuron was identified by a larger soma , time - dependent inward rectifier induced by hyperpolarizing current and spontaneous regular spike firing or by depolarizing current pulses . \n the input - output relationship was examined by injecting current pulses from 0 to 90  pa with an increment of 10  pa and an interval of 15  s , and they were lasted for 1  s. traces of action potentials in response to 1  s current steps of 10 , 50 , and 90  pa were shown in figure 1(a ) . \n the slopes of the f - i relationships were 246.92  28.00  hz / na before nmda application and increased to 325.49  73.34 \n furthermore , the input resistances were decreased by 20  m nmda in ra projection neurons ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) ( figure 2 ) . \n the afterhyperpolarization ( ahp ) of action potential underlies the modulation of firing frequency . to test the effect of nmda on spike ahp \n comparison of spike shape is shown in figure 3(a ) with 90  pa current injection before and after nmda application . in average \n , there was no significant change in the amplitude of ahp after nmda application ( p > 0.05 , n = 5 ) ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n then we used 50  m dl - apv , a nmda receptor antagonist , to check the selectivity of nmda receptor , and we found that the slope of f - i was not changed by dl - apv alone ( p > 0.05 ) . \n the slope was 255.78  66.69  hz / na and 269.34  56.96  hz / na ( p > 0.05 ) before and after application of 50  m dl - apv ( figure 4 ) , respectively . \n nmda increased the f - i slope 1.32 times ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , the gain modulation induced by nmda was completely abolished by dl - apv ( figure 4 ) . \n previous studies reported that ra projection neurons received glutamatergic and gabaergic inputs [ 23 , 24 ] , which might increase background synaptic activities and modulate the gain of neurons [ 25 , 26 ] . to determine the effect of ampa receptor and gaba receptor on gain modulation by nmda , we examined the effects of nmda in the presence of cnqx , an antagonist for ionotropic glutamate ampa receptors , or / and bicuculline methiodide ( bic ) , a competitive antagonist of gabaa receptors , respectively . \n bic ( 10  m ) accelerated the depolarization by nmda application , but bic alone had little effect on the f - i slope . in the presence of bic , \n the mean initial slopes were 276.46  59.4 and 332.6  40.02  hz / na before and during application of nmda . \n the f - i slope was increased from 1.32 to 1.39 in the presence of nmda and bic ( p > 0.05 ) ; that is , there is an increase of 105.30% over the nmda treatment ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 , unpaired t - test ) . \n cnqx ( 10  m ) decreased the membrane potential and abolished the spontaneous spikes of ra projection neurons sometimes but did not affect the slope of f - i relationship . in the presence of cnqx , \n nmda application hardly changed the f - i slope of ra projection neurons no matter whether bic was present or not ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 ) . \n these results indicated that the ampa receptor - dependent excitability played a crucial role in the gain modulation by nmda . \n the slope was 0.97 or 1.11 in the presence of cnqx or cnqx and bic , respectively . \n the gain induced by nmda was significantly decreased by cnqx ( p < 0.05 ) . \n in this study , we showed that nmda increased the gain of ra projection neurons in adult zebra finch . \n nmda - induced gain increase was limited to firing frequencies less than 40  hz . the effect of nmda on gain was mediated through nmda receptors and might involve synaptic activities . in songbirds , we found that nmda increased the slope of f - i relationship in ra projection neurons , which was completely blocked by dl - apv , a nmda receptor selective antagonist , suggesting that nmda increased the sensitivity of ra projection neurons . \n the pharmacology of nmda receptors involved in gain modulation has been examined in mammals . in cat \n visual cortex , nmda increased the gain of the contrast - response ( c - r ) curve of the neuron in layers ii / iii and v / vi . in mouse , the thalamocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus play a key role in the generation of firing patterns through nmda receptors . \n the neural activity in the afp of songbirds can direct moment - by - moment changes in the primary motor areas responsible for generating song . \n singing - related activity in lman is more variable in pattern across repeated renditions during undirected song than directed song [ 28 , 29 ] . \n reported that the fundamental frequency of the syllable was shifted by stimulating the lman - ra pathway , which is mediated by nmda receptors . \n our results indicated that the activity of nmda receptor changed the sensitivity of ra projection neuron . \n ra , as a premotor nucleus , occupies an important position in the song system , integrating information from both pathways . \n ra projection neurons are responsible for transmitting song information to midbrain and brainstem vocal and respiratory structures . temporal pattern of spike bursts in ra projection neurons is associated with the timing of acoustic features of birdsong . \n precise timing of individual spikes has a close relationship with stereotypic behavior , which suggests that the song is represented in ra by a temporal code [ 5 , 31 ] . \n thus , the modulation of nmda receptors in the activities of ra projection neurons could be very important for the plasticity of birdsong . \n previous studies in slices demonstrated that nmda receptor achieves the nonlinear , multiplicative behavior seen in gain modulation by several mechanisms . \n mel presented results from compartmental modeling studies showing that dendrites containing nmda - type synaptic conductances and voltage - dependent na , k , and ca channels can impose nonlinear interactions between nearby synapses that give rise to approximate multiplications [ 32 , 33 ] . in thalamocortical cell of the rat and cat dlgn , nmda receptors contribute to the burst firing generated by the low - threshold ca potential and depend on the membrane potential range over which this type of firing occurs . \n in substantia nigra dopamine neurons , nmda receptor - mediated synaptic conductance generates transient high - frequency activity by rapidly but transiently overwhelming the conductance 's underlying action potential ahp and/or engaging postsynaptic voltage - dependent ion channels in a manner that overcomes the limiting effects of ahp . \n but our results showed that there was no significant change in spike ahp after nmda application . \n so the gain induced by nmda in ra projection neurons may not be mainly modulated by the change of spike shape , but by synaptic activities . \n the change in membrane potential has been shown to play an important role in the firing pattern regulation by nmda receptor , supporting the idea that depolarization acutely alters firing frequency . \n it has been shown that simple excitability or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change in the cortical neurons . in this model , \n one set of synaptic inputs provided purely excitatory drive to a target neuron , and another set of combined excitatory / inhibitory inputs ( or balanced inputs ) provided the modulation . in this setup , changing the firing rates of the balanced inputs produced an approximately multiplicative gain modulation of the response to the purely excitatory drive . here \n , blockade of the excitatory or inhibitory transmission alone had no effect on the f - i slope of ra projection neuron , implying that simple excitability or inhibition alone can not induce a multiplicative gain change . \n however , our results did not exclude a role of spontaneous synaptic activity on gain modulation in vitro , which , due to the loss of synapses in slice , was not sufficient to produce a significant change in gain . \n ampa receptors are required for the gain modulation in our study , because blocking excitatory transmission mediated by ampa receptors almost abolished the effect of nmda on gain modulation . \n two reasons might be involved : one is the two states of nmda - base mechanism due to the special anatomical structure of ra . \n ra projection neurons receive inputs from two areas , hvc and lman . both are excitatory glutamatergic but have distinct postsynaptic properties . \n hvc - ra is largely mediated by ampa receptor , whereas lman - ra is almost completely mediated by nmda receptor . \n ampa / nmda receptor composition of different neuronal pathways is the foundation of gating and gain modulation . \n nmda receptor - rich pathway can gate ampa - rich input and increase the gain of a neuron responding to the input of ampa - rich pathway . \n the second is related to the intrinsic properties of nmda receptors , which are uniquely voltage dependent . except binding with neurotransmitter \n blockade of main excitatory inputs mediated by ampa receptor with cnqx hyperpolarized the membrane potential , which caused nmda receptors not activated . \n therefore , the ampa receptor - mediated excitatory transmission is essential for the gain modulation induced by nmda . \n it is well known that the nmda receptor plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes , such as learning , memory , neurodegeneration , epilepsy , and ischemia . \n the nmda receptor - mediated synaptic transmission satisfies the associative property of hebbian learning and in fact plays a critical role in its cellular model , long - term synaptic plasticity . \n nevertheless , pharmacological agents which block nmda receptors impair a variety of brain processes , suggesting that nmda receptor transmission also plays an important role beyond long - term memory and participates in shaping the dynamic activity of neural networks . in song system \n , the expression pattern of nmda receptor is related to the development of song learning [ 21 , 3740 ] . \n recent results show that the nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses generates variability across different song renditions , thereby facilitating reinforced learning of songs . how nmda accomplishes this role is not clear . \n our results showed that nmda application increased the gain of ra projection neurons , in which ampa receptor was necessary . \n the ampa receptor - mediated excitability is derived only from hvc [ 10 , 11 ] . \n therefore , nmda receptor in lman - ra synapse might regulate hvc - ra synaptic transmission , which implicated that nmda receptor is more effective to modulate the syllable online . \n these findings suggest a mechanism by which nmda receptor can selectively modulate behaviorally relevant excitatory inputs .",
         "the song of zebra finch is stable in life after it was learned successfully . \n vocal plasticity is thought to be a motor exploration that can support continuous learning and optimization of performance . \n the activity of ra , an important pre - motor nucleus in songbird 's brain , influences the song directly . \n this variability in adult birdsong is associated with the activity of nmda receptors in lman - ra synapses , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . \n the control of gain refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input and is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions . here , we observed the change of gain in ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to activate nmda receptors using the whole - cell current clamp recording . \n we found that nmda substantially increased the slope ( gain ) of the firing rate - current relationship in ra projection neurons . \n the ampa receptor - dependent excitability played a crucial role in the modulation of gain by nmda . \n these results suggested that nmda receptors may regulate the dynamics of ra projection neurons by input - output gain .",

         "suicide is a grave public health issue with a global mortality rate of 16 per 100,000 individuals.1 suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death , particularly among individuals aged 1544 years , which is a productive age group.1 suicide is a complex event that is influenced by biological , cultural , psychological , and socioeconomic factors . \n more than 90% of suicide victims were diagnosed with psychiatric problems at the time of death , and approximately two thirds had been diagnosed with depression.2,3 depressed patients tend to consult physicians other than psychiatrists , and a variety of medical professionals , including general practitioners , the staff of emergency departments , and non - psychiatric nurses , are key interveners for preventing suicide . among medical staff members , negative attitudes toward suicide such as \n anger could affect nontherapeutic reactions to suicidal individuals.4 furthermore , a belief that suicide is a personal right was negatively related to suicide intervention skills.5 an accurate assessment of the attitudes toward suicide held by medical staff members is relevant . \n previous studies have shown that difficulties with parental bonding during childhood could be a predisposing factor for the onset of many psychiatric conditions , such as anxiety , depressive states , and maladjusted behaviors.68 parental bonding and premorbid personality traits play an important role in shaping the developmental trajectory of an individual , including his / her ability to adjust to stressful events . \n although few studies have assessed the relationship between parental bonding and mental conditions among medical staff members,9,10 no study has evaluated the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide . \n the objective of this study was to investigate whether parental bonding is associated with attitudes toward suicide among medical college students in japan . \n students in their fifth year of medical school at hirosaki university , hirosaki , japan , participated in the study . \n the surveys were distributed to 226 medical students . of the distributed 226 surveys , 160 questionnaires ( 116 males and 44 females ) \n the demographic data ( age and sex ) were obtained from self - questionnaires and interviews . \n the data collection for this study was approved by the ethics committee of the hirosaki university school of medicine , and the subjects provided written informed consent before participating in the project . the parental bonding instrument ( pbi ) \n was administered to each participant to measure the attitudes and behavior of the parents.11 the pbi is a 25 item self - rating instrument by which individuals over the age of 16 report their experiences of being parented to the age of 16 . \n a total of 12 items measure the dimension of care , and 13 items measure protection , both on a likert scale . \n the care dimension of the pbi reflects parental warmth and involvement in contrast to rejection and indifference . \n the overprotection dimension of the pbi reflects parental overprotection and control in contrast to the encouragement of autonomy . \n higher scores on the care and protection dimensions reveal that participants perceive their parents to be more caring and/or protective . \n we employed the japanese version of the attitudes toward suicide questionnaire ( atts ) to assess the attitudes toward suicide held by the study participants.12 we employed a six factor model that was previously developed in studies of japanese attitudes , including \n common occurrence  ,  suicidal expression as mere threat  ,  unjustified behavior  , \n impulsiveness.12,13 each item , with the exception of items 10 and 28 , was scored on a five point scale from 1 ( strongly agree ) to 5 ( strongly disagree ) . \n items 10 and 28 were scored using a different scoring method that employed a five point scale from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) . \n multivariate regression analysis was applied to assess the relationship between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide . \n the data were analyzed using the pasw statistics software program for windows , version 18.0 . \n students in their fifth year of medical school at hirosaki university , hirosaki , japan , participated in the study . \n the surveys were distributed to 226 medical students . of the distributed 226 surveys , 160 questionnaires ( 116 males and 44 females ) \n the demographic data ( age and sex ) were obtained from self -

scales with the pbi scores . after adjusting for age and sex , \n maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the right to suicide . under the same conditions , maternal care \n the present study assessed attitudes toward suicide and their associations with parental bonding among japanese medical college students . \n the majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide ( 88.8% ) and that suicide is preventable ( 86.3% ) . \n in addition , the multiple regression analysis revealed that participants who reported a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide was a common occurrence and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide . \n domino and takahashi used the suicide opinion questionnaire to investigate the differences in attitudes toward suicide between students in japan and those in the united states , and the results demonstrated that the scores for  right to die  and  normality  were higher in japanese students and that those for  aggression  were higher in american students.14 etzersdorfer et al compared the attitudes towards suicide held by medical students in madras with those in vienna , finding that medical students in madras rejected the right to commit suicide and assisted suicide to a greater degree than the students in vienna.15 in a swedish study to assess whether attitudes differ between students at the beginning and end of their studies , students in the final year of medical school more frequently considered suicide to be an expression of psychiatric disease and thought that people attempting to commit suicide were not responsible for their actions.16 in addition , a study from japan revealed that sympathetic comments increased with the amount of years in school among students while critical comments decreased.17 in japan , mentality on suicide might be more culturally visible and acceptable than other countries . in past years , suicide was regarded as an honorable solution to personal guilt and failure . regarding occupational differences in attitudes toward suicide , \n onc et al found that medical students and general practitioners held the most permissive attitudes in turkey.18 in addition , they showed that the attitude scores of general practitioners regarding their preparedness to prevent suicide were lower compared to those of other groups . in japan , kodaka et al reported attitudes toward suicide among pharmacists using the atts.13 more than half of pharmacists reported that people understand the wishes of others to commit suicide , and 16.8% of the participants thought that people who mention suicide do not actually take their own lives . \n a 10 year follow - up study of norwegian physicians ( n=631 ) revealed that a low level of maternal care predicted severe depressive symptoms and partially mediated low self - esteem.9 lung et al assessed the psychological effects on 127 health care workers who had cared for suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) patients . \n early maternal attachment and neuroticism were found to heavily affect mental health during life - threatening stress.10 distinct patterns of parental bonding may contribute to the development of different dysfunctional schemas which may influence attitudes toward suicide.19 there are several limitations in this study . \n first , we used pbi to assess the child rearing behavior experienced by our participants . \n although pbi has shown basic reliability for long periods,20 we could not completely rule out possible influences of the current mood state or recall bias in individuals because pbi is an instrument for measuring recalled parental behaviors . \n second , certain parameters were not assessed in this study personality traits , a history of psychiatric disorders , suicidal behavior , and current mood state could affect the attitude towards suicidal behavior . third , because the participants in our study are medical students , we can not generalize these results to general practitioners . \n our study indicated that the majority of participants seriously believe that anyone could commit suicide . \n participants who have experienced a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide occurs commonly and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide . \n although parental bonding predisposes these attitudes toward suicide , educational programs could change caretaking practices.21 to achieve more positive attitudes towards suicidal behavior , promoting the best practices for suicide prevention is needed for medical students .",

term oxygen use rate was 22.4% ( n=112 patients ) in stages iii and iv patients . \n this is the first large - scale real - life study in turkey that reflects the clinical practice of pulmonary specialists through an observational analysis of their adherence to treatment recommendations of gold 2010 guideline . \n the survey was carried out in eleven pulmonary outpatient clinics spread over the national territory . \n our findings show that only 59.5% of overall patients were treated in accordance with the guideline recommendations . \n while inappropriate treatment regimens were more frequently prescribed for stages i ( 93.8% ) and ii ( 85.3% ) , overtreatment in early stages and high rate of ics administration ( 89% ) in all stages of disease resulted in improper therapeutic approach according to gold 2010 recommendations . in more severe disease stages , \n guideline - adherent therapeutic approaches were detected by wide use of ics addition to one or more long - acting bronchodilators . \n most of the provider s guideline adherence studies have reported the current practices of general practitioners . \n a few recent studies have reported similar rates of adherence to guideline recommendations for copd patients ( 37.9%54.7% ) between pulmonologists in other countries.4,5 stage i patients were overtreated with regular long - acting bronchodilators or combination of bronchodilators and icss , while guidelines recommend short - acting bronchodilators as initial therapy . in a study conducted among the pulmonary specialists in italy , corrado and rossi reported that 87.7% of the stage i patients received regular treatment containing long - acting bronchodilators , ics alone , or other treatment combinations of ics plus long - acting bronchodilators.4 in a retrospective database study in the united states , fitch et al reported that only 1% of the stage i patients received ics added to laba and lama , while 6% received ics plus single long - acting bronchodilators , and 76% did not receive any medication in stage i.11 shariff et al reported that 7.7% of the patients in stage i were overtreated and received inappropriate treatment according to the guidelines , in another study on guideline adherence among practitioners and pulmonary specialists.5 in our study , only 14.7% of the patients in stage ii received appropriate therapy , and this was mainly due to overtreatment which was combined long - acting bronchodilators and ics in 77.3% of the patients . \n other reasons for nonadherent therapeutic approaches were single use of ics in 3.4% of the patients and lack of treatment in 3.8% of the patients . other studies found 26%49.2% adherence to gold recommendations in this stage . \n overtreatment was 67.3% in one study,4 and lack of copd treatment has been reported in 54% of the patients in another report for stage ii.11 severe and very severe copd patients were treated by the combined use of one or more long - acting bronchodilators and ics which was compliant to gold recommendations . \n this finding can be explained by the features of this group of patients who are more symptomatic and have more frequent exacerbations . \n similar studies on guideline adherence in different countries also reported frequent use of dual and triple therapies in stages iii and iv.4,5,11 the ics was frequently used at all stages ( 43.8% in stage i , 81.5% in stage ii , 89.3% in stage iii , and 87.4% in stage iv ) mostly as a part of combination therapy . \n this study demonstrates that the pulmonary specialists in turkey have a high tendency to use ics for the treatment of patients with copd . in a study by de miguel - diez et al in spain , \n 34.5% of the patients were prescribed ics , alone or in combination , with a rate of inappropriate use of 18.2%.12 asche et al reported that 33% of the patients received combination treatment containing laba , lama , and/or ics consistent with the current gold guidelines.13 pulmonary specialists in our study mostly preferred to prescribe combination treatments containing ics . \n this might be related to a number of factors : \n inadequate time with patients , which leads to opting for combination therapies that can provide a broad - spectrum treatment.concerns about symptom control , exacerbation prevention alongside spirometric staging might influence the treatment choice of the specialist.reimbursement of all copd drugs in turkey , making them easily accessible for patients with health insurance.preferring to prescribe drug groups that are effective in the treatment of both asthma and copd , where a differential diagnosis is not available.increasing number of drugs that are provided in combinations and marketing strategies and publicity efforts that promote their use . \n inadequate time with patients , which leads to opting for combination therapies that can provide a broad - spectrum treatment . \n concerns about symptom control , exacerbation prevention alongside spirometric staging might influence the treatment choice of the specialist . \n reimbursement of all copd drugs in turkey , making them easily accessible for patients with health insurance . \n preferring to prescribe drug groups that are effective in the treatment of both asthma and copd , where a differential diagnosis is not available . increasing number of drugs that are provided in combinations and marketing strategies and publicity efforts that promote their use . in patients treated with regular bronchodilators ( alone or a part of a combination therapy ) , \n the most frequently used drug was laba ( n=613 ) , followed by lama ( n = 575 ) , t ( n=197 ) . among these results , \n t use was prescribed for 27.4% of stable copd patients which was remarkably higher than the finding of corrado and rossi that reported 2.2% of patients were using xanthines.4 gold remark on t is that it is effective in copd but , due to its potential toxicity , inhaled bronchodilators are preferred when available.1 in our study , this high rate of t prescription in addition to other inhaled bronchodilators may be explained by the choice of an oral bronchodilator drug even if it has potential toxicity and drug interactions in older patients . \n another finding of this study was that the use of long - acting bronchodilators such as laba and lama alone remains considerably low , and they have been mostly preferred in stages i , ii , and iii . \n the most commonly used bronchodilator in monotherapy was lama ( 4.2% ) , and this might be due to its single - dose use and duration of action of more than 24 hours.14,15 this study has several limitations . \n individual patient data were retrospectively collected through patient records : number of acute exacerbations in the previous year , complete information on comorbidities , adherence to nonpharmacologic interventions were lacking . \n gold guidelines were updated in 2011 to incorporate clinical presentation , including dyspnea as measured by copd assessment test and the modified british medical research council . \n the updated version of the guidelines incorporates clinical presentation with spirometry findings ( gold 2011).16 this study was undertaken between december 2010 and november 2011 . \n study protocol had been designed to evaluate gold 2010 guideline adherence . due to lack of knowledge on dyspnea level ( medical research council scale ) and exacerbation frequency during the last year \n even this new gold classification ( updated in 2011 ) has been changed by considering sypmtoms and exacerbations in addition to spirometric staging , we have not enough data as to the exact superiorities over the old gold classification . \n a very recent analysis showed that gold 2011 shifted the overall copd severity distribution to more severe categories . \n there were nearly three times more copd patients in stage d than in former stage iv ( p<0.05 ) . \n the predictive capacity for survival up to 10 years was significant for both systems ( p<0.01 ) and gold 2007 and 2011 did not differ significantly . in this study , \n the percent predicted fev1 thresholds of 85% , 55% , and 35% were found better to stage copd severity for mortality , which are similar to the ones used previously in the gold 2010 classification . increasing intensity of treatment of patients with copd according to their gold 2011 reclassification \n is not known to improve health outcomes.17 the classification recommended by the gold committee since 2011 does not seem to be adopted universally throughout europe . \n even if there is a real improvement over the previous classification due to taking into account clinical criteria , quality of life , and exacerbations , criticisms have arisen concerning the choice of certain pathways and therapeutic recommendations not based on prospective studies with a high level of evidence.18 at the national level , we do not have any published data on the adoption of the new gold 2011 classification . according to the previously mentioned obstacles of the new classification , and lack of the knowledge about the frequency of new gold 2011 classification use , instead of the gold 2010 . \n we believe this data on the guideline adherence among pulmonologists may still reflect the current attitude toward the routine approach of the diagnosis and therapies of copd in turkey , and also is concordant with the real life situation around the world . \n turkish thoracic society has published an updated report of copd prevention , diagnosis and treatment in 2014,19 and included in the global alliance against chronic respiratory disease ( gard ) with the ministry of health.20 the improvement of adherence to national and international copd guidelines may be achieved by continuing medical education supported by national thoracic societies . increased awareness of guidelines may influence the standardized care of copd patients , and will have prognostic influences . \n promotion of the compliance to evidence - based medicine by health authorities may have also positive effects on the attitude change in the real - life applications . \n this study showed that the pulmonary specialists in turkey have low rates of adherence to gold guidelines for treatment of stable copd patients . \n major improper approaches were overtreatment in early stages and excessive use of inhaler corticosteroids in all stages of disease . \n new strategies are needed to achieve a standardized approach for the treatment of copd , and thus to improve adherence to guideline recommendations , with particular focus on treatment indications and overtreatment in turkey .",

         "o - glycans have been found to play an important role in protein stability and tertiary structure , stabilize protein conformation , modulate the activity of enzymes ( e.g. by reversible attachment of o - linked glcnac to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins ) and signaling molecules , are essential for a number of recognition processes and are sorting determinants guiding the modified protein in the cell from the place of biosynthesis to its target location [ 13 ] . \n unlike the n - glycans they may be linked to several different amino acid residues ( very often serine or threonine , but also hydroxylysine , tyrosine or hydroxyproline ) of the protein and their occurrence can not be predicted easily by a common consensus sequence . \n extended galnac residues linked to serine or threonine residues ( mucin - type glycans ) are the most frequent and best investigated o - glycans in higher eukaryotes . \n eight core subtype formations showing cell - tissue specific patterns related to their function have been described ( for a review see ) . \n also glcnac--ser / thr without any elongation , a typical feature for nuclear and cytoskeletal proteins existing in a dynamic equilibrium with phosphorylation , and fuc--ser / thr as well as glc--ser , primarily found in epidermal growth factor domains , have been found in eukaryotes . \n a linkage via mannose has been found to be the main o - glycan type in yeasts , but also some mammalian tissues carry this structural feature , which seems to be relevant in some muscular dystrophies , while o - xylosylation is the starting point for the biosynthesis of chondroitin and heparan sulfates , which have roles in development and morphogenesis . \n the o - glycans of nematodes are rather complex with methylation as further modification [ 9 , 10 ] . \n xenopus eggs have o - glycans with up to 10 monosaccharide constituents , often highly fucosylated , with a linkage to the protein via galnac [ 11 , 12 ] . \n even parasites ( helminths and t. cruzi ) display small galnac linked o - glycans . in plants \n o - glycans occur as arabinogalactans linked to hydroxyproline or serine ( gal--hyp / ser ) , or hydroxyproline is glycosylated with short arabinofuranosides ( ara--hyp , ara--hyp ) . here \n we present for the first time an overview on o - glycans of some species of the mollusk branch of the evolutionary tree . \n the glycosylation potential of snails is important in general , because some of them are intermediate hosts of pathogens ( biomphalaria glabrata and lymnaea stagnalis ) or a pest in agriculture \n . a broad knowledge of their glycosylation abilities may show targets for pest control in the near future . \n in the course of the years , n - glycan patterns of several snail species have been presented [ 1417 ] . methylated mannose and galactose residues were found to be frequent constituents . in the present study we determine the main o - glycan structures in snails and characterize a common core - trisaccharide . \n cepaea hortensis , planorbarius corneus , arion lusitanicus , limax maximus and helix pomatia were collected by the authors under the supervision of dr . \n manfred pintar ( department of integrative biology and biodiversity research , institute of zoology , university of natural resources and life sciences , vienna ) in the vicinity of vienna . \n all chemicals purchased were of the highest quality available from sigma or fluka . while water living snails could be dissected right away , land living snails were extensively washed to remove the extraneous mucous components . \n snails were dissected as previously described   and proteins were purified according to   with minor modifications : 1  g of wet tissue was homogenised in 10  ml of chaps - based lysis buffer ( 0.5  % ( w / v ) chaps , 150  mm nacl , 20  mm tris / hcl , 2.5  mm sodium pyrophosphate , 1  mm ethylene - glycol - bis(2-aminoethylether)-n , n , n,n-tetraacetic acid and 1  mm edta , ph  7.5 ) and incubated for 72  h at 4  c . \n snail proteins were then reduced by the addition of 500  l of 10  mm dithiothreitol and incubation at 56  c for 45  min . \n then 500  l of 55  mm iodoacetamide were added and incubated for 30  min at room temperature in the dark . \n the aqueous samples were precipitated with a 4-fold amount of pre - chilled acetone at 20  c for at least 4  h and then centrifuged at 32000  g for 60  min . \n the pellets were resuspended in 0.1  m sodium citrate buffer , ph  4.6 , and incubated with 2 units of -glucosidase from rice [ ec 3.2.1.20 ] at 37  c for 16  h. sugars and polysaccharides were eluted from cation exchange chromatography ( ag 50  w - x2 , biorad , ca ) with 2  % of acetic acid , while proteins were eluted by 1.0  m ammonium acetate , ph  9.0 . \n the protein fraction was again precipitated by acetone followed by a similar precipitation by methanol . \n the dry sample was dissolved in 0.1  m naoh containing 0.8  m nabh3 and incubated at 37  c for 68  h. the sample was carefully neutralised by the addition of 2  m acetic acid , dried in a vacuum centrifuge and washed at least twice with 30  % ( v / v ) methanol . \n the glycans were directly extracted by solid phase extraction on a porous graphitized carbon cartridge ( supelclean envi - carb , 100  mg bed weight , 1  ml column volume or 500  mg bed weight , 6  ml column volume , sigma - aldrich , germany ) according to   by using ammonium formate buffer / acetonitrile for elution   and then on a reversed - phase c18 cartridge ( strata , c18-e , 55  m , 50  mg bed volume , 1  ml column volume , phenomenex , germany ) using 5  % ( v / v ) acetic acid as loading solvent and 25  % ( v / v ) isopropanol in 5  % ( v / v ) acetic acid for elution . \n hplc separation was carried out on a porous graphitized carbon ( pgc ) column ( hypersil - keystone , hypercarb 5   150    3  mm , thermo scientific , austria ) at a flow rate of 0.6  ml / min using 0.3  % ( v / v ) formic acid adjusted to ph  3.1 with ammonium as solvent a and 95  % ( v / v ) acetonitrile in solvent a as solvent b. the elution protocol consisted of 2  min at 100  % ( v / v ) of solvent a followed by a gradient of 28  min till 25  % ( v / v ) of solvent b and a cleaning step of 4  min at 60  % ( v / v ) of solvent b. each fraction was tested by esi - ms for its glycan content . \n single glycan structures were pooled and lyophilised . for monosaccharide analysis alditol acetates and for linkage analysis \n gc analysis was carried out on a vf 5  ms capillary column ( 60  m , 0.25  mm inner diameter ; 0.1  mm film thickness ; varian , darmstadt , germany ) and electron impact ( ei ) mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode using a polaris q instrument ( thermoquest - analytical systems ) . for analysis of small sample amounts with esi - ms an in - gel release method for glycans bound to coomassie \n reduced oligosaccharides were analyzed by pgc - lc - esi - ms on a hypercarb column ( 0.32    150  mm , thermo fisher scientific , austria ) coupled to an ultimate 3000 ( dionex ) capillary hplc and a q - tof ultima ms ( waters ) as described previously [ 21 , 26 ] . \n the interpretation of the ms data was performed with the help of the software tool glycoworkbench . \n arion lusitanicus proteins were isolated and separated from contaminants through several purification steps in order to obtain sufficient amounts ( 12  g ) of pure glycans for further gc - ms analysis ( total monosaccharide and linkage analysis ) . \n the preparation of o - glycans was carried out via -elimination followed by further separation steps . as a final procedure \n the glycans were separated on a pgc ( porous graphitized carbon ) hplc - column by collecting 1-minute fractions which were screened by esi - ms to gain clean single structures . in the course of the -elimination releasing the glycan from the protein backbone , sodium borohydride was used . \n in contrast , for reduction of monosaccharides before gc - ms analysis sodium borodeuteride was employed , which allowed further the discrimination between the sugar released by -elimination and those linked to other sugars previously . in fig \n .  1 monosaccharide constituents of the core trisaccharide representing the main structure found in a. lusitanicus , with a pseudomolecular mass ( [ m+h ] ) of m / z 576.3  da , were determined by gc - ms of the corresponding alditol acetates and identified on the basis of retention times in gc and their characteristic electron impact ( ei ) mass spectra . \n the results revealed the presence of a galnac - residue which was h - reduced , while all the other sugars were h reduced . \n therefore , galnac can be considered as the protein bound sugar . the high amount of 4-o - me - gal indicated that this residue is the one which is mainly involved in the elongation of the glycan . \n minor compounds were identified as contaminations by n - glycans ( glcnac and man ) or storage glycans ( glc and gal ) . \n the lc - esi - ms / ms fragmentation pattern confirmed the occurrence of two methylated hexoses linked to the amino sugar ( fig . \n 1monosaccharide constituent analysis of the core trisaccharide of a. lusitanicus released by [ h ] reductive -elimination . \n alditol acetates obtained after acid hydrolysis , reduction with sodium borodeuteride and peracetylation or hydrolysis and peracetylation of already existing alditols were identified by gc -

glycan core structure identified 2,3,4,6-tetra - o - methyl - galacitol at 20.66  min and 1,4,5-tri - o - methyl galnac - ol at 33.33  min ( fig \n .  3a ) which could be verified by ei - ms data ( figs . \n 3b and c ) . to determine the position of the naturally occurring methyl group on the galactose \n this allows in the ei -

column . \n a glycan consisting of the methylated core trisaccharide and one further hexose ( m / z 738.3 [ m+h ] ) was found . \n this additional hexose was an unmethylated gal residue linked alternatively to one of the two arms of the trisaccharide explaining the two isoforms detected by pgc selected ion chromatogram ( fig . \n the fourth structure ( m / z 914.4 [ m+h ] ) which was obtained in sufficient amounts for gc - ms consisted of the core trisaccharide elongated by an unmethylated hexose on one arm and a methylated hexose on the other one ( fig . \n the presence of significant amounts of man and 3-o - me - man indicated that these two residues were responsible for the elongation . \n gc - ms analysis using different derivatisation protocols requested a high amount of material and high quality of purification . especially for snail tissues this was a challenge and \n therefore this method could not be carried out for a large number of samples in due time . \n an in - gel -elimination after sds - page followed by a short clean - up ( pgc - cartridge ) procedure was sufficient . \n the shortened protocol also ensured that no weakly bound modifications , such as sulfate or sialic acids for example , got lost . combining our data on snail monosaccharide analysis , data from previous gc - ms methylation analysis   and the fragmentation results of lc - esi - ms / ms analysis of selected snails we could determine the main structures of snail o - glycans and classify them according to their modification of the established core structure into six groups : ( i ) glycans smaller than the core , missing one or both methyl groups or missing one hexose ; ( ii ) the trisaccharide core containing galnac and two 4-o - methylated hexose residues ; ( iii ) the core with additional methylated hexoses ; ( iv ) the core with one or two additional unmethylated hexoses and sometimes one more methylated hexose ; ( v ) glycans containing fucose ; ( vi ) glycans containing one hexnac and up to six unmethylated hexoses . \n for an overview on the structures see table  1.table 1overview of o -

glycan distribution in selected snail species given in [ % ] of total o - glycans . \n compositions are given in terms of hexose ( hex ) , methylated hexose ( mehex ) , n - acetylhexosamine ( hexnac ) and deoxyhexose ( fucose ; dhex ) analyzing snails in detail , it was obvious that the o - glycan trisaccharide core is an important decoration of snail proteins in all investigated species . in five of the analyzed snails ( a. lusitanicus , a. fulica , h. pomatia , l. maximus , c. helena ) this glycan was the most abundant type of o - glycan . \n b. glabrata and c. hortensis displayed as their main glycan the trisaccharide elongated by one or two unmethylated hexoses , respectively . \n only p. corneus was an exception possessing a large amount of hex4hexnac glycan . whereas the addition of one hexose to the core was relatively frequent , larger structures were minor compounds or were even not present in several species . \n the only detected amino sugar was galnac which provided in all cases the connection to the protein . \n gal and man were present in unmethylated or mono - methylated ( 3-o - me - gal , 4-o - me - gal , 3-o - me - man ) versions . \n fucose , which had been identified as such in previous works [ 23 , 28 ] , occurred only in low amounts and was detected linked to galnac as well as to terminal sugar residues by ms / ms fragmentation . \n during the last decades our knowledge on glycosylation processes - structure of the glycans and the corresponding biochemical pathways including the responsible enzymes - increased enormously , especially for glycans of mammalian origin . \n the glycosylation capabilities of other species were only under investigation if their glycans were for any reason connected with human life ( e.g. some recognition processes of pathogens or allergy on food or plant glycans ) or if they were potent candidates for cell culture systems for the expression of therapeutics ( some insect , yeast and plant cells ) . \n in the meantime more and more invertebrate systems are investigated because of their potential usefulness for biotechnological reasons or to get some deeper insights into the processing pathways of unusual glycan structures . \n previous studies on various invertebrates showed that glycosylation has a lot more varieties than we expected as long as only mammals were investigated , but the data are scattered . \n still the main focus is laid on n - glycans but the interest in o - glycans is growing . \n a number of difficulties arose during snail glycan analysis due to the tough tissue , which was not easy to homogenize and the rigid mucus , which had to be discarded diligently . \n the removal of storage carbohydrates , which might influence monosaccharide analysis and the separation of n- and o - glycans were other struggles to resolve . while the first was done by -glucosidase digestion from rice , the latter was an even more difficult task . \n n - glycosidases ( pngase a and f ) did not remove the n - glycans completely and even mild -elimination conditions seemed to be able to release , at least in part , residual n - glycans which resulted in n - glycan impurities in o - glycan fractions . \n furthermore some n - glycans of snails and digested storage glycans are so small ( 45 sugar residues [ 16 , 17 ] ) that they may co - migrate on hplc with o - glycans \n . therefore only a limited number of glycans could be prepared in terms of sufficient amount and purity for permethylation followed by maldi - tof - ms and gc - ms linkage analysis . \n however , in combination with lc - esi - ms of native glycans which is capable of a high throughput of samples the o - glycan pattern of 8 snail species ( land snails with shell : achatina fulica , cepaea hortensis and helix pomatia ; slugs : arion lusitanicus and limax maximus ; water snails : biomphalaria glabrata , clea helena , and planorbarius corneus ) could be identified . \n four monosaccharide constituents  galnac , gal , man and fuc  are the building blocks of the structures . \n the only further modification is a methylation of the hexoses , resulting in 3-o - me - gal , 4-o - me - gal and 3-o - me - man , which has already been shown for snail n - glycans [ 1417 , 23 ] . \n each o - glycan contains only one amino sugar , which is the protein linked galnac . \n the linkage amino acid was not determined in detail , but due to the easy release by -elimination the common galnac - ser / thr motif is very likely . \n the connection to other amino acids , for example tyrosine , is usually more stable . in snail o - glycans the inner galnac \n is frequently elongated by two 4-o - me - gal residues in ( 13)- and ( 16)-linkage . elongations of this trisaccharide core by one or two hexoses with or without methyl group appeared in most snail species , whereas further elongation or fucosylation are rare events . \n insects , one neighbor of mollusks in the phylogenetic tree , display also internal galnac elongated by one gal in their o - glycan structures , but further elongations and/or branching are frequently done by another amino sugar ( galnac or glcnac ) . \n the main o - glycans of toxocara canis are trisaccharides consisting of galnac , gal or 4-o - gal and 2-o - fuc . \n so far nothing is known about biological functions of snail glycans . for sure these glycans \n are similarly involved in recognition processes as they are in all other species , but especially the significance of the high degree of methylation of hexoses of n- as well as of o - glycans is waiting for elucidation . here \n we enlarge the current knowledge on glycosylation abilities of lower animals by presenting the first o - glycan analysis of snails , representatives of the mollusk phylum .",
         "the glycosylation abilities of snails deserve attention , because snail species serve as intermediate hosts in the developmental cycles of some human and cattle parasites . in analogy to many other host - pathogen relations , the glycosylation of snail proteins may likewise contribute to these host - parasite interactions . here \n we present an overview on the o - glycan structures of 8 different snails ( land and water snails , with or without shell ) : arion lusitanicus , achatina fulica , biomphalaria glabrata , cepaea hortensis , clea helena , helix pomatia , limax maximus and planorbarius corneus . \n the o - glycans were released from the purified snail proteins by -elimination . \n further analysis was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and  for the main structures  by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry . \n snail o - glycans are built from the four monosaccharide constituents : n - acetylgalactosamine , galactose , mannose and fucose . \n an additional modification is a methylation of the hexoses . \n the common trisaccharide core structure was determined in arion lusitanicus to be n - acetylgalactosamine linked to the protein elongated by two 4-o - methylated galactose residues . \n further elongations by methylated and unmethylated galactose and mannose residues and/or fucose are present . \n the typical snail o - glycan structures are different to those so far described . \n similar to snail n - glycan structures they display methylated hexose residues .",

         "neurofibromatosis ( nf ) is an autosomal dominant disease , discovered in 1882 , by the german pathologist friedrich daniel von recklinghausen , characterized by disordered growth of ectodermal tissues , and is part of a group of disorders called phakomatoses ( neurocutaneous syndrome ) . \n neurofibromatosis type - i ( nf-1 ) , also known as von recklinghausen syndrome , is caused by the mutation of a gene on the long arm of chromosome 17 , which encodes a protein known as neurofibromin . \n it is characterized by spots of increased skin pigmentation ( caf au lait spots ) , combined with peripheral nerve tumors and a variety of other dysplastic abnormalities of the skin , nervous system , bones , endocrine organs , and blood vessels . \n the localized form of neurofibromatosis type - i , first described by gammel in 1931 , is very rare . \n crowe et al . proposed the term sectorial neurofibromatosis for this localized form of neurofibromatosis , and miller and sparkes modified the nomenclature to segmental neurofibromatosis ( sn )  the current term for neurofibromas of segmental distribution . \n the commonly affected sites for sn are the thorax and abdomen ( 55% ) , upper extremities ( 20% ) , and lower limb and face ( 10% each ) . only few cases ( less than 10 ) of segmental neurofibromatosis over the face have been described so far . \n a 26-year - old female patient reported to the dental department complaining about the unesthetic appearance of her face , since eight years [ figure 1 ] . \n history revealed that eight years back , the patient underwent surgery in the neck region for a cyst and one to two days after surgery the patient got a swelling on the face . \n the swelling was of the same size since then and there was no pain associated with the swelling . \n the unesthetic appearance of the face on examination , the face of the patient appeared asymmetrical , bilaterally , with a growth on the right side of the face . \n the skin over the right side of her face was thickened and hyperpigmented , with a soft and loose hanging overgrowth . \n there were numerous small and large , sessile and pedunculated nodular growths localized on the right side of her neck , with dark - colored underlying skin . \n the skin over the right cheek and chin area showed coffee - colored pigmentation ( caf - au - lait spots ) [ figure 2 ] . \n nodular growths localized on the right side of the neck with dark colored underlying skin there was a soft , compressible , nontender growth on the lower lip . \n the right ear showed disfigurement and hypertrophy , with thickened cartilage and overlying hyperpigmented skin [ figure 3 ] . \n disfigurement of the ear and hypertrophy with thickened cartilage and overlying hyperpigmented skin intraorally there were numerous soft tissue growths with a sessile base seen on the right buccal mucosa [ figure 4 ] and tongue [ figure 5 ] . \n soft tissue growths with sessile bases on right buccal mucosa soft tissue growths with sessile bases on the tongue laboratory findings revealed a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) ( 70 mm in the first hour ) , a decreased hemoglobin level ( 7.5 gm% ) , and the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) was found to be nonreactive . a panoramic radiograph disclosed asymmetric enlargement of the right side of the mandible , with loss of cortication of the lower border in the midline area , expansion of the body of the mandible causing displacement of the teeth , seen on right side , expansion of the right inferior alveolar nerve canal , enlarged mental foramen , resorption of the roots of the mandibular right teeth , and loss of the right antegonial notch . \n a deficiency was seen on the right side of the maxilla , with crowding of the posterior teeth [ figure 6 ] . \n a panoramic radiograph the right lateral oblique radiograph revealed a deep sigmoid notch , loss of the antegonial notch , an enlarged and rounded coronoid process , with resorption of the mandibular right teeth [ figure 7 ] . \n a right lateral oblique radiograph subsequently , biopsy of one of the nodules was taken and sent for histopathological examination . \n the histopathological slide revealed a non - encapsulated tumor of the dermis with a normal overlying epidermis . \n the tumor consisted of loosely spaced spindle cells and wavy collagenous strands in a clear matrix [ figure 8 ] . a non - encapsulated tumor of the dermis , with a normal overlying epidermis \n these tumors are composed of schwann cells , fibroblasts , mast cells , and vascular components . \n the caf au lait spots are irregularly - shaped , evenly pigmented , brown macules . \n most individuals with neurofibromatosis have six or more spots that are 1.5 cm or greater in diameter . in young children , \n five or more caf au lait macules , greater than 0.5 cm in diameter , are suggestive of neurofibromatosis . \n less than 1% of the healthy children have three or more such spots , although one or two caf au lait macules are commonly encountered in healthy individuals without disease . \n bone involvement includes pseudoarthrosis of the tibia , bowing of the long bones , and orbital defects . \n treatment of neurofibromatosis is predominantly surgical . when neurofibromas increase in size or cause pain , malignant transformation must be suspected , and excision or biopsy must be performed . \n acoustic neuromas and tumors that cause tinnitus and vertigo must be excised with great caution . \n plastic surgeons may be included in the correction of deformities , especially those of the face . considering the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of neurofibromatosis , genetic counseling",
         "segmental neurofibromatosis is a rare disorder , characterized by neurofibromas or caf-au - lait macules limited to one region of the body . \n its occurrence on the face is extremely rare and only few cases of segmental neurofibromatosis over the face have been described so far . \n we present a case of segmental neurofibromatosis involving the buccal mucosa , tongue , cheek , ear , and neck on the right side of the face .",

         "small non - coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells . \n they include sirna ( small interfering rna ) , mirna ( microrna ) , pirna ( piwi - interacting rna ) and snorna ( small nucleolar rna ) . \n mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled - stranded small rna which are ~20  nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base - pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ] . although over 1,000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species , as many as 1,000 to 10,000 mirnas per genome have been predicted [ 3 , 4 ] . \n mirnas regulate a broad range of biological processes including timing of development , cell cycle progression , stem cell self - renewal , differentiation , cancer initiation , cancer cell proliferation , metastasis and apoptosis [ 511 ] . \n cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells . \n many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation . \n mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis . \n emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis , functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . \n although the current treatment of radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth , prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life , metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur . \n as small non - coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis , they may represent a novel cancer therapy . \n unlike mrna , mirnas are transcribed but never translated . some mirnas are transcribed from non - coding regions between genes , deriving from independent transcription unit . \n other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome , deriving from the introns of gene transcripts [ 13 , 14 ] . \n mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna . \n the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al . , \n in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines . \n zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array - based comparative genomic hybridization . \n the results demonstrated a high frequency ( ~72.8% ) of gene copy number abnormality in mirna - containing regions in human breast cancer . \n wang et al . collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues . \n mir-21 , mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over - expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir-126 , mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples . \n our studies of the mir-17 - 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient . \n subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling . \n although the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression . \n many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis . \n mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway . \n the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] . \n le et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 - 92 cluster . \n adams et al . reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer . \n the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary . \n herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation ( fig . \n 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in ~50% of breast cancer . \n the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate - limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition [ 23 , 24 ] . \n in addition , cyclin d1 is a critical downstream target of erbb2- , ras- and -catenin- induced breast cancers , and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice . \n antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut - transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice . \n conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 , mir-15/16 , mir-23 and let-7 . \n mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr , inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 , resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation [ 18 , 26 ] . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 - 92 , as well as mir-15/16 , was confirmed by deshpande et al . . \n the let-7 family functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers including lung , colon , ovarian   and breast cancer . \n schultz et al . demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis , and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( nrf-1 ) to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . \n furthermore , cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration , and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis . \n the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle , cell growth and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in breast cancer . \n mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1-s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ] . \n moreover , mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal - like breast cancers . \n the breast cancer basal - like subtype - specific mirnas , mir-221 and mir-222 , promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 ( trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ) which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression . \n mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance . \n the onco - mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . \n mir-21 induced cellular proliferation , migration , invasion , emt , cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer [ 42 , 43 ] . \n high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis , advanced stage , positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer . \n mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of a tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) . in colon cancer , \n mir-21 participates in a dna damage - induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a . \n a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells . with a potential anti - cancer chemical 3,3-diindolylmethane treatment , \n mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines . in mda - mb-231 cells , \n mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 , thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation . \n mir-27a suppressed myt-1 , increased cdc2/cyclin b activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda - mb-231 cells . thus , distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell - cycle checkpoints including cyclins , cdks , cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus . \n in addition to cell - cycle control , breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas . \n cancer stem cells ( cscs ) are characterized by their self - renewal capacity , an ability to differentiate into non - tumorigenic cell progeny , and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts . \n cell surface markers such as cd44 , cd24 , cd133 , epithelial - specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs . \n the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor - initiating cells ( t - ic ) has been widely investigated . \n let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells ( es cells ) and increases with differentiation . \n a comparison of mirna expression between breast t - ic and non - t - ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in t - ic and increased abundance with differentiation . \n transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells , inhibited cell proliferation , mammosphere formation , and tumor formation in vivo . \n clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs ( cd44cd24lineage ) and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells . \n the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem / progenitor cells . \n expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro , and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo . \n ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast t - ics self - renewal , inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 . \n zhu et al . found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast t - ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression , and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival . \n enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin - induced apoptosis and dna damage . \n emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation , cancer metastasis and drug resistance . \n cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer . \n the discovery that non - coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs , and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy . \n deletion of chromosome 6q , including region 6q14-q16 , is frequently observed in breast cancer . \n the small non - coding snorna u50 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 - 16 region , playing a role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer . \n genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines . \n re - expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 t and mda - mb-231 . \n pirnas are small non - coding rna that form rna - protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins . \n pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells , and considered as germ line - specific small rnas . \n emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells [ 57 , 58 ] and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells . \n high - throughput deep sequencing identified a group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines . \n the study of these non - coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting . \n the identification of the expression signature of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes , and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression , tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer . \n small non - coding rna - based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future . although tumor - targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer , mirna - based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models . \n synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro . chemically modified lna anti - sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells . \n kim et al . recently reported significant anti - tumor effect of virus - mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer . \n intranasal delivery of let-7   and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics   for non - small - cell lung cancer treatment and a virus - mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model   demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer . \n dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non - coding genome as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors of breast cancer . \n experimental evidence has shown specific mirnas regulating the initiation , progression , metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer via control of the cell cycle , altering cellular proliferation , altering cellular apoptosis and/or controlling the population of tumor stem cells . dysregulated \n mirna expression has also been observed in cancer associated fibroblasts ( caf ) and in the systemic circulation [ 65 , 66 ] . \n the circulating mirnas have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer . \n a specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients .",
         "small non - coding rnas include sirna , mirna , pirna and snorna . \n the involvement of mirnas in the regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis has been widely studied while the role for other small non - coding rnas remains unclear . here \n we summarize the involvement of mirna in breast cancer onset and progression through regulating the cell cycle and cellular proliferation . \n the regulation of breast cancer stem cells and tumor regeneration by mirna is reviewed . \n in addition , the emerging evidence demonstrating the involvement of pirna and snorna in breast cancer is briefly described .",

         "the family is the cornerstone of human social support network and its presence is essential in everyone s life . changes inevitably occur in families with illness and hospitalization of a family member . in other words , among the sources of stress for families are accidents leading to hospitalization particularly intensive care unit ( icu ) . \n statistics show that 8% of hospital beds in the united states are occupied by the intensive care units . \n stress in the family while the patient is in the icu can disrupt the harmony power of the family members and finally , it may causes disturbances in the support of the patient . \n in addition to the various sources of stress in intensive care units such as the patient s fear of death , financial problems , lack of awareness about the environment and etc . , their satisfaction level is another important source of stress for the patient s family . \n today , the family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu are summarized in five sections . \n these factors may include receiving assurance , staying close to the patient , receiving information , feeling comfortable and receiving support . \n however , in many cases , the patient s family needs and their expectations in the icu will not be fulfilled which will cause dissatisfaction . since , how families deal with mental stress is the most important components of comprehensive care , it should be known that attention to the family needs of the patients hospitalized in intensive care units could increase their satisfaction and thus a reduction in stress disorders . \n studies showed that the nurses in particular sections focus primarily on the patient and the disease . \n therefore , attention to the families should be considered as an important part in patient management . \n effective interventions targeted at the needs and expectations of family members should help to reduce the stress and improve their satisfaction . \n fox et al . stated that the needs of the family members were not often overlooked by the nurses . \n however , the nurses spend a lot of time with the patients and their families and are in a good position to assess their needs and plan for meeting these needs with appropriate interventions . \n the reason of investigating the satisfaction of the families of the patients in the icu is that the patients are facing life - threatening illness experiences and complex treatments , different technologies and different equipment are used for them . \n these cases could potentially lead to the dissatisfaction of their families . in the meantime , \n the families of trauma and neurosurgical patients are more vulnerable than the other groups of patients . \n they need supports that are more emotional and should be accepted by the icu staff . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit , \n the aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients . \n the tool of society of critical care medicine s family needs assessment ( sccmfna ) ( which has been validated in 1998 by johnson ) was used in that study . \n the results showed that most of the family satisfaction was related to the communication and patient care and the lowest level of satisfaction was about the ability of staff to patients family comfort . \n bailey et al . have conducted a study in 2009 with the purpose of investigating the relationship between informational support to families of special care patients and their anxiety and satisfaction . \n they showed that there is a direct link between the informational support and their satisfaction . \n the study of fumis et al . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient s family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient s condition to them will increase the patient s family satisfaction . \n this clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction of the patients in the special care units and their families in iran . \n the purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital in 2010 . \n the statistical research community was the families of hospitalized patients in neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra ( sa ) hospital , isfahan , iran from may to september 2010 . \n with respect to inclusion criteria , the families of 64 patients were selected with simple sampling . after obtaining the informed consents from the hospitalized patients , by using the envelopes , which were prepaid by using a table of random numbers , they were divided into two groups ( intervention and control ) . \n the inclusion criteria was included as the following cases : to be a first - degree member of the family , to be older than 18 years , willing to participate in the study , having the power to speak and write in farsi , to be hospitalized one day before the study , lack of physical or mental problem in the family member , no responsibility for the care of another patient , introduced as the first person responsible for the patient care . \n obtaining the written informed consent , completion of the questionnaires about demographic information and the families satisfaction were performed in the second day of hospitalization of the patients in icu in both groups . \n johnson questionnaire for the satisfaction of the family of icu patients was used to measure the family satisfaction . \n the rating of the questionnaire was performed by using the likert scale with four options of 0 to 4 as follows : almost all the time ( 3 scores ) , often ( 2 scores ) , only occasionally ( 1 score ) and never ( zero score ) . \n johnson s questionnaire was the modified type of multer patient s family needs , which was evaluated in various scientific researches and there are extensive evidences for its validity . \n the interventions were performed in the second and the third day of hospitalization of the patient in the neurosurgery icu by the researcher in the morning shift for the intervention group . \n thus , the researcher provided understandable explanations about the disease to the patient s family and answered honestly to the questions about the patient and the disease . \n the researcher ensured them for providing the best care in the section and spoke about the prognosis of the disease . \n the researcher took the family member to the patient s room and gave the necessary information about the room space , equipment , personnel departments and the actions that were done for the patient . \n the patient family member was contacted if there was a change in the patient condition . \n they let the family help the patient in some cases of the public health ( such as hand and foot massage and giving food ) . \n locations of rest , nutrition , prayer room , bathroom and buffet of the hospital were introduced to them . \n the telephone numbers of hospitals and wards ( and if necessary , the social worker and supervisor ) were given . \n various departments and personnel of the hospital were taught to accept the families and communicate with them . the hospital social worker was introduced and if necessary , the patient s family was allowed to express their feelings . \n these interventions were performed in the evening shift of the second and the third day of the patient reception . \n the actions were carried out by the fellow researcher . while , for the control group , only the routine work was done . on the fourth day , the satisfaction survey was completed by the selected family member in both of the intervention and control groups . \n statistical methods used in this study were 2 test , man - whitney , independent student s t - test and paired t - tests . \n the findings did not show statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups , such as : age ( p < 0.99 ) , gender ( p < 0.79 ) , marital status ( p < 0.41 ) , educational level ( p < 0.12 ) and relation with patient ( p < 0.54 ) . as shown in table 1 \n , there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score before the intervention in the intervention and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) . \n the mean satisfaction score after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly more than the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . \n the mean satisfaction score in the intervention group after the intervention was significantly higher than before the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . \n there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score in the control group before and after the intervention ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . \n comparison of mean satisfaction score ( 100 * ) of participants in the intervention and control groups the mean of satisfaction score changes of the studied subjects in the intervention and control groups after intervention \n the results of the present study showed that the nursing interventions based on the family needs increased the patient s family satisfaction in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital . \n due to the differences in the study design , study population , the number of samples and methods of intervention , it would be difficult to compare the results . in chien et al . \n study , the results showed that performing the training based on the patients family needs in the icu , decreased the anxiety and increased their satisfaction . in the study of myhren et al . indicated that effective communication of the staff with the families of icu patients would increase their satisfaction . \n in the study by rosher and robinson , it showed that involving the families in patient care led to increase their satisfaction than before the intervention . \n the mentioned results were consistent with the results of this study , because all of these interventions were some parts of the interventions performed in this study . \n however , the study of steele et al . indicated that clinical training had no impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in the icu \n . therefore , there was no statistically significant difference in the satisfaction level in the control and intervention group . \n in this study , it was shown that the use of nursing interventions based on family needs ( confidence , support , information , proximity and convenience ) had significant impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in intensive care unit . \n they should be based on the family investigation and recognition and their priority needs should be determined in order to cause the greatest satisfaction . \n the icu nurses must also accept their role in the care of patient s family members . \n the findings of this study could be a basis for performing further studies about family needs of the patients in the icu especially with the different forms of culture and economy . \n consequently , the increase in family satisfaction of patients can reduce the stress disorders and improve their mental state and ultimately better support of the patient by the family . \n this study only examined the effect of nursing interventions in the first days of hospitalization on the satisfaction of the families but the effects on the patient s entire hospitalization period has not been assessed . by performing other researches in this field \n , it would be possible to compare the differences in the effects of nursing interventions based on the needs of families in the early days and the whole period of the patient s hospitalization .",
         "background : since the family is a social system , the impairment in each of its component members may disrupt the entire family system . \n one of the stress sources for families is accidents leading to hospitalization particularly in the intensive care unit ( icu ) . in many cases , \n the families needs in patient care are not met that cause dissatisfaction . since the nurses spend a lot of time with patients and their families , they are in a good position to assess their needs and perform appropriate interventions . \n therefore , this study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery icu.materials and methods : this clinical trial was conducted in the neurosurgery icu of al - zahra hospital , isfahan , iran in 2010 . \n sixty four families were selected by simple sampling method and were randomly placed in two groups ( test and control ) using envelopes . in the test group , \n some interventions were performed to meet their needs . in the control group , \n the routine actions were only carried out . \n the satisfaction questionnaire was completed by both groups two days after admission and again on the fourth day.findings:both of the intervention and control groups were compared in terms of the mean satisfaction scores before and after intervention . \n there was no significant difference in mean satisfaction scores between test and control groups before the intervention . \n the mean satisfaction score significantly increased after the intervention compared to the control group.conclusions:nursing interventions based on family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu increase their satisfaction . \n attention to family nursing should be planned especially in the icus .",

binding sites , i.e. , the s189n change within antibody - binding site b ( 4,5 ) and the v226i and s227p changes residing in antibody - binding site d ( 4,5 ) . because of rotational restrictions , a proline substitution at position 227 ( s227p ) would typically give rise to considerable conformation change ; however , this particular substitution is located within a  barrel motif and therefore has little effect on regional protein conformation . cumulatively , field isolates characterized subsequent to this outbreak continue to exhibit these 4 changes , and they appear to constitute a distinct branch in the phylogeny of ha sequences when compared with h3n2 isolates from the 20032004 season . \n . this change may affect protein - protein interactions since it is immediately adjacent to antibody - binding site a , where neutralizing antibodies have been shown to bind ( 4,5 ) . \n furthermore , since the k145n substitution is located within a glycosylation site , the charge alteration may affect glycosyl transferase activity , which results in altered glycosylation . \n differences in glycosylation have been shown to contribute to antigenic variation by preventing antibody binding to antigenic sites ( 15 ) . \n additionally , 3-dimensional analysis suggests this amino acid substitution may also promote enhanced receptor binding since the asparagine r group is shorter , which may make binding requirements less stringent and the receptor cleft more accessible . \n the 3-dimensional depiction provides a unique regional residue perspective , demonstrating how the rapidly evolving ha surface antigens in the vaccine strain differ at the molecular level . \n collectively , the clinical isolates obtained from this outbreak in nepal can not be considered antigenically distinct from the a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain because only 4 of 9 isolates evaluated exhibited 4-fold lower titers by hi ( table 1 ) . \n furthermore , the varying reactivity noted in several isolates from this outbreak having identical ha1 sequences is suggestive that other viral antigens aside from the ha1 protein may have contributed to the antigenic variability observed in the hi panel . with the exception of a / nepal/1670/2004 and a / nepal/1672/2004 , all isolates evaluated by hi ( table 1 ) exhibited identical ha1 amino acid sequences and varying antigenicity profiles to a / wyoming/03/2003 reference antisera . \n one explanation for this observation is that genetic differences in other influenza surface proteins contribute to the observed immunoreactivity . \n alternative viral surface protein candidates include the neuraminidase , ha2 , and m2 glycoproteins , which have been shown to exhibit antigenic properties ( 1619 ) . in this report \n , we describe the genetic analysis of the ha proteins from viruses obtained from an early season outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains . \n three amino acids changes ( s189n , i226v , and s227p ) were noted in known ( 4,5 ) antibody - binding sites ( table 2 ) . the fourth change ( k145n ) , which was located within a glycosylation site , may enhance viral binding since the smaller asparagine r group is located close to the ha receptor - binding cleft ( figure 3 ) . \n phylogenetic analyses show that the nepal isolates make up a distinct branch in the evolution of h3n2 viruses when they are compared with vaccine and reference strains ( figure 2 ) . however , antigenic data appear more ambiguous , suggesting a multigenic effect that can not solely be attributed to properties of the influenza ha ( table 1 ) . \n studies are in progress to characterize the neuraminidase , m2 , and ha2 proteins to determine the molecular basis responsible for antigenicity differences observed within isolates from this outbreak . \n the k145n substitution change has become a marker for an increasingly large subset of the fujian - like viruses . \n cdc and the us department of defense have recently characterized viruses with the k145n change in singapore , taiwan , china , australia , canada , and the united states . in february 2005 , who reported the emergence of a new influenza h3n2 strain in the united states . \n the a / california/7/2004 strain , which was first identified in the united states in september 2004 , contains all 4 changes observed in isolates from this nepalese outbreak . \n the a / california/7/2004 strain differs by only 1 amino acid in ha1 ( which is of no immunologic importance ) from most isolates from the outbreak in nepal . \n all viruses characterized ( 150 globally isolated strains ) subsequent to the preparation of this report ( march 2005 ) by the us department of defense are genetically similar in amino acid sequence to these nepalese strains ( and the a / california strain ) . \n most of the isolates ( 80% ) analyzed by cdc since october 2004 are antigenically related to a / california ( 20 ) , which indicates that this strain has emerged as the dominant influenza a h3n2 strain . \n these data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant strain at the onset of the 20052006 influenza season . in february 2005 , who recommended inclusion of an a / california/7/2004-like strain in the 20052006 trivalent influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from this variant h3n2 virus . \n our findings emphasize the importance of continued molecular surveillance for characterizing emerging influenza drift variants .",

         "medical tourism is illustrated as occurrence in which individuals travel abroad to receive healthcare services ( 1 ) . \n it is a multi - billion dollar industry and countries like india , thailand , singapore , malaysia , belgium , costa rica , cuba , dubai , hungary , israel , jordan , south africa and many others are being benefited in their economy by this recent phenomenon ( 2 , 3 ) . \n the prime driving factors in medical tourism are increased medical costs , increased insurance premiums , increasing number of uninsured or partially insured individuals in developed countries , long waiting lists for procedures in countries having public healthcare system , availability of high quality services at affordable price , and cheaper airfare . increased communication and internet access in developing countries \n are other supporting factors , which help patients to develop awareness about international travel for medical care ( 47 ) . \n estimations can vary but still some of reliable sources claim ; gross medical tourism revenue worldwide was more than us$ 40 billion in year 2004 and reached up to us$ 100 billion by year 2012 ( 8) . in year 2007 \n , it was estimated that around 750,000 us residents traveled abroad . accordingly , the base case estimated form 2007 to 2010 for the annual growth rate for outbound patients was 100 per cent in us ( 9 ) . \n forbes business estimated around 1.25 million americans were expected to travel outside for medical treatment in year 2014 ( 10 ) . \n after thorough review it was found that there is huge gap in literature available in medical tourism . \n accounts detailing size and market of the industry are large in number yet there is scarcity of literature detailing about role and significance of different variables and linking them to form conceptual and theoretical framework which reflects decision making of international patients for taking part in medical tourism . \n available literature explore various factors related to patients travel such as source of information , perceived risks , benefits of medical tourism and attributes of medical tourism destinations in sufficient amount but almost all of these related accounts are exploratory in nature and do not provide conceptual frameworks for testing . \n many researchers ( 2 , 6 , 11 , 12 ) made calls to explore more about the decision making process based on conceptual models and test them empirically , so managers in medical tourism industry will be more acquainted about the needs and requirements of patients and design their future strategies accordingly and at the same time patients will also be benefited by receiving more quality services from the providers . \n this article will draw a conceptual model based on patients source of information , perceived benefits , perceived risks , and medical tourism destination image with available literature that will be helpful to mangers to draw their future course of action for competitive advantage and at the same time fulfill the gap in available literature . \n image formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place . \n various studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain destinations as possible alternatives ( 1317 ) . \n consumer behavior studies have already established the effects of source of information on purchase behavior ( 18 ) . \n amount and type of different information sources directly influence in development of cognitive image formation of destination ( 19 ) . \n source of information is a vital antecedent of destination image formation and destination choice intention ( 20 ) . \n there are four ( i ) professional advice ( tour operators , travel agents , airlines ) ( ii ) word of mouth ( friends , relatives , social media ) ( iii ) advertisement , and ( iv ) news / books / movies , different categories of type of information sources usually consider responsible for destination image formation ( 13 ) , this article use these four categories of source of information for medical tourism destinations image formation . \n medical tourism facilitators are specialized in promotion of medical services abroad and offer supportive services such as assisting in selection of country and hospital , correspondence with doctors , travel arrangements , and arrangements of required paper work ( 21 , 22 ) . \n judgment of agent related to travel of their clients has high influence on decisions of clients ( 23 ) . \n these facilitators serve as motivators also due to providing much - needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own . \n many hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) . \n literature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra - structure , unavailability of specialized manpower , and unavailability of medication ( 2730 ) . \n word of mouth and recommendation also has high influence in decision making of international patients in selection of destinations , hospitals , and doctors . \n studies revealed large numbers of patients visit different countries for medical services were received recommendations from family members , friends , relatives , and colleagues ( 3134 ) . \n websites and online forums created by experienced international patients to share their experiences with medical tourism are also considered as decisive source of information for those planning to take medical services abroad ( 35 , 36 ) . \n printed materials are also used to promote the services by hospitals and clinics , for example air mauritius in - flight magazine provides details about procedures and services provided by the hair grafting clinics in mauritius ( 2 ) . \n major medium of promotion of services by destination countries are trade fairs , travel markets / travel fairs , exhibitions , seminars and conferences to make potential patients informed about products and services offered by destinations . \n some of these fairs and exhibitions are organized in collaboration with government agencies like tat , ministry of foreign affairs and department of export promotion but some providers organized these events by their own in cooperation with local institutes , medical schools and universities ( 37 ) . \n print media play an important role in promotion and advertising medical tourism in major source countries , publish attractive and evidence based stories in their different segments related to health and travel . \n los angeles time first examined about the growth of medical tourism and marked it as trend . later on new york times and los angeles times published stories of satisfied patients . \n fox , cbs s  60 minutes  and cnn aired their segments on patients traveling to medical services . \n magazines like forbes and wall street journal analyzed the business aspect of medical tourism as  brokers assertively marketed medical tourism to consumers , employers , and insurers ( 38 ) . \n literature revealed that not every physical attribute of a destination has influence on image formation process . \n there is substantial inequality between descriptive dimensions of image and the attributes which are considered important for decision making within individuals ( 39 ) . \n it is generally presumed in marketing that products with similar characteristics will be equally preferred by the consumers , however , attributes , which make the product similar to other products , will not be necessarily same at the time of actual purchase . the importance of attributes will be change according to the need of consumer ( 40 ) . wish ( 1971 ) cited in ( 40 ) found that despite have many similarities individual like one country and dislike another one . \n this is due to dimensions of liking may not be agree with the dimensions of similarity . \n literature revealed that many researchers made distinction between physical and beneficial aspect of a product . \n few researchers explained it as  characteristic and  benefits to the physical and beneficial aspect of product respectively ( 41 ) . \n the typology of different attributes of product has been proven fruitful because by this a product s features can be segments into three groups as characteristic , beneficial , and imagery . \n there are three components of vacation destination image formation ; ( i ) based on awareness : rely on the information sources , tourist believes about what a destination possesses , ( ii ) based on attitude : feelings and beliefs about destination , and ( iii ) based on expectations : expected benefits obtain from a tourist product ( 43 ) . \n the above mention discussion clearly indicates that process of image formation is not just emphasis on physical attributes of destination but also depends on benefits or consumption values of product or service consumers hold in their minds . \n benefits offered by a product or service are considered as consumption value of the same ( 44 ) . \n sheth , newman and gross ( 1991 ) developed a theory known as theory of consumption values , which focuses on consumption values of products and services ( 45 ) . \n conditional value. the decision making of consumer choice behaviour can be based on all five or any of the five consumption values . \n consumption value model define the characteristics of  functional value as price , credibility , and durability . \n medical tourism destinations offer very low price for medical services to international patients in comparison to developed countries , and most of the time price of a procedure in india and other asian destination is equal to 1/10 of price in us or european countries ( 4 , 4648 ) . \n quality of medical services is one of the aspects which drive medical tourism high towards success . \n most of the hospitals in india provide medical care services to international patients are certified by jci which has reputation for hospital safety and regulatory management and recognized worldwide ( 49 ) . \n high procedure success rate also forms image as quality medical tourism destination of various destinations at south asian , african and latin america ( 48 , 49 ) . \n although availability of literature explain  social value in medical tourism is less , little available literature clearly define the \n social value aspect has been clearly observed in yemeni patients travel abroad for treatment ( 27 , 50 ) . \n senior male members of the household consider it as opportunity to increase their reputation in society . availing expensive and prestigious medical care service in foreign countries and the associated sacrifices with it would make stories full of pride to tell to others ( 51 ) . \n most of the citizens of yemen do not obtain resources to go for leisure travel at different parts of the world therefore traveling to foreign country for medical services provide chance to explore new territory , meet new people , and experience different social culture ( 27 , 50 ) . \n however , the concept of social value and epistemic value may not be associated with patients from developed regions . \n many researchers found in their studies that patients were highly motivated to travel to a particular destination due to emotional attachment with doctor , hospitals or destination ( 6 , 50 ) . \n such as , many omani patients visit shiraz in iran for treatment due to religious and cultural familiarity ( 52 ) . \n conditional value can be considered as major factor pushes patients to travel abroad because medical needs are crucial and considered as unavoidable so have great conditional value . \n perceived risks is defined as perception of an individual about the probability that a particular action will lead them to a situation exposed with danger more than acceptable limit , and will lead to influence travel decision - making ( 53 ) . security and safety at the destination is major issue of concern by the potential travelers . in travel decision , \n making perception of risks has utmost importance due to its tendency to alter destination selection ( 54 ) . \n researchers argued in favor of conducting study on perceived risks and destination image together ( 55 ) . in tourism literature , authors considered safety and security at destination as one of the pull factors caused destination image formation ( 13 , 14 , 56 ) . \n however , in general cognitive image of destination does not engage with varied range of travel specific risks at destination and consider safety and risks as one of the many other attributes associated with destination ( 54 ) . \n in addition , at the same time perceived risks are considered as potential inhibitors of travel ( 57 ) . \n researchers argued that using cognitive image to understand the dimensions of travel risks will be a conceptual mistake ( 58 ) . \n hence , perceived risks and cognitive image should consider individual variables for image related studies in travel . \n credence goods as the quality of these good can not be assessed accurately even after consumption . \n patients may vulnerable to many risks if consider to take medical services at medical tourism destinations . \n researchers described six dimension of risks associated with health travelers visited israel as  human - induced risks , \n financial risks ,  service quality risks ,  socio - psychological risk ,  natural disasters and car accident risk , and \n after thorough literature review , authors categorized medical tourism destination perceived risks into three categories , as  physical - health related risks ,  service related risks , and  destination related risks. physical risks are considered as possibility of physical danger or injury detrimental to health where as health risks are considered as possibility to becoming sick while traveling or at destination ( 54 ) . \n in medical tourism , international patients can be exposed with different diseases , so risk of contracting with a different kind of disease is even higher such as blood borne infection and infection due to improper screening and storage of blood , deep - vein thrombosis ( dvt ) to those patients returning home after surgery , language related risks and lose of money can also be a matter of concern while involved in medical tourism . \n health risks for patients travel for organ transplant is even higher due to ignorance of standard protocol in donor selection ( 12 , 6062 ) . \n literature revealed few american patients came in contact with non - tuberculous mycobecterial infection while taking treatment in hospitals abroad ( 63 , 64 ) . \n researchers consider terrorism and kidnapping of rich patients and unstable economy of the destination as other risks associated with medical related travel . \n apart from physical - health and service related risks , every destination have its own associated risks ; risks of terrorism , crime , and personal safety are associated with medical tourism destination due to falling in middle and lower middle - income countries in development status ( 63 ) . according to researchers , destination image is the total of ideas , beliefs , and impressions individuals possess about the attributes of destination and or activities available at a destination after processing information from various sources over a period of time ( 39 , 65 ) . \n destination image as overall imagery picture individual obtains in his mind ( 66 ) . in the early studies on travel \n , researchers used the concept of stereotypic image of a travel destination ( 67 , 68 ) . later on , to understand the destination image formation process researchers developed an alternative framework and argued destination image consist of two components i.e. attribute based and holistic ( 66 ) . \n attribute based component refers to the perception of individual based on destination features and holistic component refers to imaginary mental image of destination . \n later on , a bi - dimensional model was presented by researchers to represent destination image , consist of cognitive and affective image component ( 13 , 69 ) . \n the cognitive component of destination image develops on knowledge and beliefs of destination based on tangible attributes , whereas affective component of image develops on emotions and feelings about the destination ( 70 , 71 ) . \n researchers further studied affective image of destination and illustrate a four semantic differential scale to evaluate the affective component of destination image based on arousing \n furthermore , cognitive component of destination image is an antecedent of affective component ( 72 ) . \n thus , a distinctive image of a destination forms in tourists mind based on strength and weakness of attributes of cognitive and affective components . image of destination formed in consumer s mind is defined as aggregate of attributes and beliefs ( 73 ) . \n it means if tourist has enough level of positive beliefs about attributes of destination it is expected that s / he has developed favorable attitude towards destination . \n the process of destination image formation is described as mental construct of representation of destination based on information cues transmitted by image inducing agents chosen by individual ( 19 ) . \n after thorough literature review authors identified four dimension of cognitive medical tourism destination image based of different attributes projected by different medical tourism destinations , as ;  medical amenities ,  general infra - structure ,  tourism attractions , and \n social environment. most of the hospitals websites are dominated with images stressing on sophistication , advanced technology , cleanliness and efficiency . \n majority of these sites are in english highlight the variety of procedures , price , accreditation of hospitals , and affiliation of doctors , qualified and smart staff , lavishly furnished accommodations , and testimonials of past patients , and efficiency with different languages of staff . \n command on technology is rarely missed in any form of marketing ( 12 , 46 , 74 , 75 ) . \n based on mentioned qualities , medical tourism destinations project themselves as most suited destination for potential travelers ( 28 , 32 , 76 ) . to nullify the quality related concerns of international patients hospitals and medical tourism facilitators / brokers emphasis on the markers of quality services . \n physicians trainings in world reputed institutes like national institute for health , johns hopkins university , university of birmingham , and other reputed universities are highlighted in the profiles of physicians . \n prominent display of training and expertise of doctors achieve two goals ; established trustworthiness and mitigate concerns related to risk . \n the accreditation awarded by jci is promoted by hospitals as mark of offering medical care of american standards ( 2 , 28 , 77 ) . \n collaboration with prestigious hospitals in us and europe in also indicate seriousness towards providing quality services to patients by medical tourism hospitals at different destination ( 21 , 78 ) . distinguishing that major market drivers such as lack of health insurance and unaffordability are influencing patients to take procedures abroad , websites of brokerages predominantly display the comparative cost charts and price schedules . \n most of the destinations claim providing significant cost services through different sources of promotion ( 5 , 79 , 80 ) . \n most the promotions and advertisements show smiling , well - dressed and empathetic medical staff taking care of international patients . \n many hospitals focus on multi - lingual staff providing services to patients speaking different major languages of the world . \n language is also an influencing factor in decision making in selection of destination ( 11 , 37 ) . \n facilities and quality of accommodation to international patients and their companions play important role in attracting the foreign patients . \n essential supportive services like local transportation services , food , communication , and others are also important in attracting the patients to a destination . \n thailand for example attracts more patients from developed countries because of already established quality tourism infrastructure offer excellent accommodation and hospitality services to international patients ( 81 ) . despite offering excellent medical care to international patients by hospitals in india most of the international patients visit india worry about accommodation quality , food hygiene , and personal safety ( 82 , 83 ) . \n potential tourists prefer to receive medical services to the places where they are also interested for holidaying ( 75 , 84 ) . after focusing on cost and reliability \n image formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place . \n various studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain

physicians trainings in world reputed institutes like national institute for health , johns hopkins university , university of birmingham , and other reputed universities are highlighted in the profiles of physicians . \n prominent display of training and expertise of doctors achieve two goals ; established trustworthiness and mitigate concerns related to risk . \n the accreditation awarded by jci is promoted by hospitals as mark of offering medical care of american standards ( 2 , 28 , 77 ) . \n collaboration with prestigious hospitals in us and europe in also indicate seriousness towards providing quality services to patients by medical tourism hospitals at different destination ( 21 , 78 ) . distinguishing that major market drivers such as lack of health insurance and unaffordability are influencing patients to take procedures abroad , websites of brokerages predominantly display the comparative cost charts and price schedules . \n most of the destinations claim providing significant cost services through different sources of promotion ( 5 , 79 , 80 ) . \n most the promotions and advertisements show smiling , well - dressed and empathetic medical staff taking care of international patients . \n many hospitals focus on multi - lingual staff providing services to patients speaking different major languages of the world . \n language is also an influencing factor in decision making in selection of destination ( 11 , 37 ) . \n facilities and quality of accommodation to international patients and their companions play important role in attracting the foreign patients . \n essential supportive services like local transportation services , food , communication , and others are also important in attracting the patients to a destination . \n thailand for example attracts more patients from developed countries because of already established quality tourism infrastructure offer excellent accommodation and hospitality services to international patients ( 81 ) . despite offering excellent medical care to international patients by hospitals in india most of the international patients visit india worry about accommodation quality , food hygiene , and personal safety ( 82 , 83 ) . \n potential tourists prefer to receive medical services to the places where they are also interested for holidaying ( 75 , 84 ) . after focusing on cost and reliability \n prominent databases ( 2013 , 2014 , 2015 ) have been searched to obtain desire literature related to medical tourism including science direct , utmj.org , nih.gov , nchu.edu.tw , palgrave - journals , medretreat , biomedcentral and so on and the keywords used are medical tourism , information sources , medical travel , health travel and so on . \n google search was performed to get latest data related to medical tourism . to know in detail about the variables used in the framework scientific research databases \n the key words used to find out research variables as well as relationship between researches variables were destination image , destination information sources , beneficial image , perceived travel risks , cognitive image , affective image , consumption values and so on . to obtain data about medical tourism various types of available literature were reviewed such as industry reports , market research reports , media reports and internet sources , however for identification and explanation of variables scientific literature published in reputed journals only were included . \n the theory of planned ( tpb ) is an established and comprehensively tested model details the relationship between beliefs , attitude , intention , and actual behavior of consumers ( 85 ) . the model is perfectly applied in a variety of studies including leisure and tourism travel , and hospitality ( 36 , 8688 ) . \n these research studies emphases on the factors such as motivations , information sources , attitudes , and visit intentions , thus authors argue that attitudinal theory provides a sound foundation to understand travel intentions of international patients and underpin the conceptual model discussed in this article . \n studies explained that consumers access more information in case of high association of risks or benefits or both in a particular act ( 89 , 90 ) and perform rigorous information search in case of planning first time trip ( 91 ) because first time trip is associated with unknown risks as well as unknown leisure activities . \n in general consumer behaviour practices risk - handling activity increases in case of high level of perceived risks . \n importance of risk handling activity also determines by associated benefits gained after engaging with risk taking activity ( 92 ) . \n the benefits of information search includes possibility of finding superior alternative to those already considered and the reduction in risk achieved from eliminating inferior , but a priori uncertain , alternatives ( 93 ) . with the discussion of above literature related to tourism \n it could be assumed that medical tourism information sources will have positive influence on perceived travel benefits of international patients . whereas , information sources of medical tourism will negatively influence perceived travel risks of international patients . \n destination image is considered as perceptions or impressions of destination held by tourists with respect to the expected benefit or consumption values . \n the benefits sought by the travelers are highly associated with the image of destination and the affective image of destination is largely highly influenced by the motivations / benefits sought by individuals ( 13 , 44 ) . \n the affective image of a destination is more positive in individual s mind when emotions evoked by the place coincide with the benefits sought ( 95 ) . \n risks and constraints associated with travel have significant impact on destination image formation at the time of early decision - making process ( 96 ) . according to researchers , \n two dimensions significantly influence cognitive and affective image of destination ( 58 ) . on the basis of previous studies in tourism literature \n it can be assumed that perceived travel benefits of international patients will positively influence the destination image , whereas perceived travel risks of international patients will negatively influence the destination image . \n intention of visit related to travel is considered as tourists perceived likelihood to visit particular destination within a specific time period ( 97 ) . \n thus , to be closely correlated to the travel behaviour intention of visit believes as an important outcome variable in tourism research ( 16 , 97 ) . \n intention to visit a destination is highly influenced by cognitive / perceptual and affective evaluation ( 98 ) . \n destination image is a direct antecedent of perceived quality , satisfaction and revisit intention and recommendation ( 99 ) . according to researchers \n , there is significant theoretical and empirical link between cognitive destination image and behavioral intention ( 100 ) . \n based on above discussion it could be assumed that image of medical tourism destination will positively influence visit intention of international patients . conceptual framework  international patients travel decision making \n the article is a sincere effort by authors to establish conceptual framework which explains decision - making process of international patients . \n though , there has been advance in explaining different factors play important roles in international patients travel , however , there is scarcity of literature conceptualizing these factors into a framework and test it empirically . \n literature reveals about associated benefits and risks related to travel abroad for medical purposes but do not conceptualize it in the process of decision - making . \n sources of information in medical tourism play significant role in development of attitude as well as intention , has already been established in consumer behavior . \n however , need is to test its significance in medical tourism decision - making process . \n the proposed framework will encourage future researchers to test different variables empirically and establish the model of international patients travel behavior . \n ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc . ) have been completely observed by the authors .",
         "background : role of information source , perceived benefits and risks , and destination image has significantly been examined in travel and tourism literature ; however , in medical tourism it is yet to be examined thoroughly . \n the concept discussed in this article is drawn form well established models in tourism literature.methods:the purpose of this research was to identify the source of information , travel benefits and perceived risks related to movement of international patients and develop a conceptual model based on well - established theory . \n thorough database search ( science direct , utmj.org , nih.gov , nchu.edu.tw , palgrave - journals , medretreat , biomedcentral ) was performed to fulfill the objectives of the study.results:international patients always concern about benefits and risks related to travel . \n these benefits and risks form images of destination in the minds of international patients . \n different sources of information make international patients acquaint about the associated benefits and risks , which later leads to development of intention to visit . \n this conceptual paper helps in establishing model for decision - making process of international patients in developing visit intention.conclusion:ample amount of literature is available detailing different factors involved in travel decision making of international patients ; however literature explaining relationship between these factors is scarce .",

         "squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( hnscc ) is a heterogeneous disease that includes tumors arising from the mucosal epithelial surface of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , and larynx . although these tumors originate within different anatomic sites within the upper aerodigestive tract , they are histologically identical ( 95% of hnscc are squamous cell carcinomas ) , share common etiologic risk factors and overlapping metastatic target site profiles ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) . \n recent genetic analysis of human head and neck tumors has revealed common molecular alterations including p53 mutation , p14arf , and p16 methylation , as well as cyclin d and egfr amplification [ 36 ] . despite these similarities , \n the distinct anatomic subsites are associated with differing rates of regional metastasis  for example , vocal cord lesions tend to metastasize less frequently than oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal lesions . this variation may be attributed to differing densities of lymph draining vessels within each of the relevant subsites . \n patients who exhibit metastases into the regional nodal basin exhibit a 50% decrease in survival irrespective of treatment [ 715 ] . \n currently , it is the 5th leading cause of cancer by incidence and the 6th leading cause of cancer mortality in the world [ 16 , 17 ] . \n recurrent and/or metastatic hnscc patients have a poor prognosis , with a median survival of less than 1 - 2 years [ 18 , 19 ] . \n several lines of evidence indicate that cancer is a disease resulting from dynamic changes in the genome that promote the progressive transformation of normal human cells into highly malignant derivatives [ 20 , 21 ] . during this process , \n cancer cells acquire several unique capabilities including self - sufficiency in response to growth signals , insensitivity to antigrowth signals , evasion of programmed death ( apoptosis ) , limitless replicative potential , sustained angiogenesis as well as invasion and metastasis , reprogramming of energy metabolism , and avoiding immune destruction [ 21 , 22 ] . \n detailed global genomic analyses of several human tumors has revealed that certain classes of signaling proteins appear to be targeted more frequently by oncogenic mutations . \n receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) are a good example . of the 59 transmembrane rtks identified to date , \n dysregulation of ~30 rtks are associated with neoplastic transformation and cancer progression [ 2325 ] . \n interestingly , ninety percent of primary head and neck squamous cell cancers , irrespective of subsite , have alterations in members of the epidermal growth factor ( egf ) family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( erbbs ) , in particular erbb1/egfr . \n ten to fifteen percent of tumors will also have an alteration in another egfr family member , the erbb2/her2/neu receptor [ 27 , 28 ] . \n these findings suggest a strong etiologic role for rtk dysregulation in this type of tumors . given this association , patients with head and neck squamous cell cancers are well positioned to benefit from existing and future molecular targeted agents directed against oncogenic rtks such as egfr ( reviewed in ) . \n rtks are a family of transmembrane proteins that mediate many important physiological processes in both normal and cancerous cells . \n ligand binding to the extracellular domain of rtks induces receptor dimerization and activation of rtk activity . \n subsequent autophosphorylation of the receptor at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain generates binding sites for proteins that relay downstream biological signals to regulate protein function , protein - protein interactions , and gene expression . under physiological conditions , \n rtk dysregulation can occur through several mechanisms including gene amplification or rtk overexpression , chromosomal translocation to produce constitutively active rtks , gain of function mutations or deletions that promote ligand - independent rtk activity , escape from negative regulatory mechanisms or local environmental changes , all of which lead to potent oncogenic signaling and hence neoplastic growth . \n these complex signaling networks use multiple factors to drive the outcome of rtk signaling . although often depicted as linear pathways , they actually represent an integrated network with various modes of cross - talk , overlapping and distinct functions . \n known signaling pathways involved in head and neck tumorigenesis include the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( pi3k)-akt - mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stats ) and raf kinase - mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( mek)-p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling pathways [ 1 , 30 ] . \n this review highlights three rtk signaling pathways involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ; egfr , the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) and the hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) receptor ( met ) . \n this short review will explore the relative contribution of each signaling axis to disease progression , potential modes of cross - talk , and targeted clinical approaches under investigation for disease management . \n the egfr family of rtks is comprised of four different receptors known as erbb1 ( also referred to as egfr ) , erbb2 ( her2/neu in rodents ) , erbb3 ( her3 ) , and erbb4 ( her4 ) ( reviewed in [ 3133 ] ) . each receptor , with the exception of erbb3 , contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated by binding to extracellular egf - like ligands , which result in receptor dimerization and hence activation of downstream signaling cascades including mapk , pi3k / akt and stat signaling . \n eleven egf - like ligands have been identified to date that can be categorized into four groups  those that bind egfr only ( egf , transforming growth factor alpha ( tgf ) , and amphiregulin ) , those that bind to egfr and her4 ( heparin binding - egf , betacellulin and epiregulin ) , those binding directly to either her3 and her4 ( neuregulin 1 and neuregulin 2 ) and her4 binding only ( neuregulin 3 and neuregulin 4 ) ( reviewed in ) . \n epigen , the most recently discovered member of the egf - like ligand family appears to be a low affinity and broad specificity ligand that effectively activates egfr . \n erbb2 is considered a ligand - less coreceptor as it does not have any known ligands that bind directly with high affinity , despite its established role as a potent oncogene in several cancer types including breast , colorectal , nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc ) and hnscc [ 36 , 37 ] . \n aberrant egfr activity has been strongly linked to the etiology of 5890% of hnscc [ 26 , 38 ] . \n these rates can vary due to the inclusion of cancers from different subsites within the head and neck , methods used to assess gene amplification and tumor scoring methods . in contrast to lung adenocarcinomas in which activating egfr mutations result in ligand - independent signaling [ 3943 ] , such activating egfr mutations are infrequent in hnscc [ 44 , 45 ] . \n egfr gene amplification resulting in upwards of 12 copies per cell has been reported in hnscc patients compared to copy numbers detected in normal mucosa from noncancer patients . \n this and other pathways of ligand - independent receptor activation that do not require egfr overexpression have been characterized as the likely drivers of egfr activity in hnscc . \n egfr gene amplification remains a strong indicator for poor patient survival , radioresistance , and locoregional failure [ 4749 ] . \n egfr overexpression is detected in healthy mucosa in cancer patients ( field cancerization ) that will increase in proportion to observed histological abnormalities such as hyperplasia , carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma , indicating that it is an early event in hnscc . \n accordingly , significant effort has focused on egfr signaling as a therapeutic target for treating hnscc patients . \n cetuximab , matuzumab and nimotuzumab represent humanized antiegfr antibodies , whereas gefitinib and erlotinib are small tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) ( figure 1 ) . \n cetuximab ( erbitux ) competitively inhibits endogenous ligand - binding to egfr and thereby inhibits subsequent receptor activation [ 5053 ] . \n cetuximab is a valuable treatment option in head and neck patients as it synergizes with current treatment modalities . \n cetuximab enhances the effects of many standard cytotoxic agents , including cisplatin ( the conventional platinum - fluorouracil chemotherapeutic ) , and in combination with chemotherapy it can elicit antitumor responses in tumors that previously failed to respond to that chemotherapy . \n notably , cetuximab did not dramatically exacerbate the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy of the head and neck , including mucositis , xerostomia , dysphagia , pain , weight loss , and performance status deterioration . \n cetuximab has been approved for use in combination with radiation for treating patients with locally advanced hnscc   and as monotherapy for patients with recurrent hnscc . \n matuzumab ( formerly emd 72000 ) binds to egfr with high specificity and affinity to block receptor signaling , and also modulates antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( adcc ) when combined with cetuximab [ 5860 ] . \n phase i clinical trials report excellent antitumor activity of matuzumab against several human tumor types including head and neck cancers . \n a randomized phase iib , four - arm , open - label study recently assessed the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination with radiation therapy ( rt ) or chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) in patients with advanced ( stage iii or iva ) hnscc . \n the addition of nimotuzumab to both the radiation and chemoradiation regimens was reported to improve the overall response rate , survival rate at 30 months , median progression - free survival and median overall survival . \n a combined group analysis of the nimotuzumab arms versus the non - nimotuzumab arms demonstrated a significant difference in overall survival favoring nimotuzumab . \n this study is compelling as patient response rates compare favorably with studies combining cetuximab with radiotherapy , but with fewer side effects . \n gefitinib ( iressa ) is a small molecule tki - targeted to the intracellular active site for phosphorylation that has been tested in clinical trials involving hnscc patients , as a single agent or in combination with radiation treatment . \n unfortunately , gefitinib has shown limited clinical efficacy with response rates of 1015% [ 63 , 64 ] . \n erlotinib is a selective inhibitor of the egfr that also shows antitumor activity in hnscc comparable to standard combination chemotherapy . \n another promising rtk under preclinical and clinical evaluation for head and neck cancers includes the igf-1r ( reviewed in [ 66 , 67 ] ) . \n two ligands , insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf1 ) and igf2 bind to igf-1r . \n ligand binding to the igf-1r stimulates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , activating downstream signaling networks including ras - raf , mapk and erk , and pi3k ( figure 1 ) to drive cellular functions such as cell growth , survival and differentiation . \n it is widely accepted that the igf - axis activates antiapoptotic signaling , which in turn upregulates the pi3k - akt and mapk pathways in cancer cells . \n additionally , igf - ir also regulates vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) production , suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis . \n several studies indicate that igf-1r is overexpressed and functional in 94% of hnscc patient samples [ 70 , 71 ] . \n consistent with this , igf - ir signaling significantly enhances the proliferation , motility and tumorigenicity of human head and neck cancer cell lines . igf-1r \n down regulation in a hnscc cell line using antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a dose - dependent decrease in cellular proliferation , induction of apoptosis , caspase activation and reduced expression of proangiogenic cytokines such as vegf . \n interest in targeting the igf-1r in hnscc was bolstered by the observation that treatment of head and neck cancer cells with either igf or egf resulted in igf - ir and egfr heterodimerization [ 71 , 72 ] . \n however , only igf resulted in the phosphorylation of both receptors . using a mouse xenograft model for hnscc , treatment with antibodies against igf-1r , egfr or \n it remains to be determined whether cellular cross - talk between igf-1r and egfr has an important role in determining the biological aggressiveness of hnscc or resistance to egfr - targeted therapies . \n several monoclonal antibodies and tkis for igf-1r have been tested in preclinical studies and early phase clinical studies . \n however , the efficacy of igf-1r - targeted therapy for treating patients with hnscc , particularly cross - talk with egfr , warrants further investigation . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer cell lines [ 7375 ] . \n treatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] . targeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) . similarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) . \n these studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of anti - igf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc . \n the met receptor is a single pass transmembrane protein that upon binding its ligand hgf  also known as scatter factor - promotes increased cell proliferation , survival and motility ( reviewed in [ 78 , 79 ] ) . \n hgf is the only physiological ligand for met and is secreted as an inactive precursor polypeptide chain by mesenchymal cells . \n hgf is proteolytically cleaved to form an active / heterodimer by a number of serine proteases including urokinase plasminogen activator ( upa ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tpa ) , coagulation factors x. xi and xii . \n met is a disulphide - linked / heterodimer derived from the proteolytic cleavage of a 170  kda precursor . \n the  chain and n - terminal region of the -chain form  sema domain , a seven -propeller structure in which blades 2 and 3 bind to hgf . \n the sema domain is flanked by a cysteine - rich region followed by four immunoglobulin repeats . \n it is proposed that the cysteine - rich region and immunoglobulin repeat domains undergo a conformational change following hgf binding allowing for met dimerization [ 80 , 81 ] . \n binding of hgf to met results in receptor autophosphorylation at key catalytic residues and subsequent recruitment of several cytosolic signaling molecules that are shared with the egfr and igf-1r signaling pathways , including the grb2/sos complex , the p85 regulatory subunit of pi3k , gab1 and jak / stat3 ( figure 1 ) . \n subsequent activation of the mapk and jun - n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) pathways is responsible for the mitogenic and motogenic properties of met / hgf signaling resulting in  invasive growth  , depending on the physiological setting . \n increased met signaling in human cancers can be the result of enhanced ligand - binding ( autocrine and paracrine ) , met overexpression or missense mutations that often induce constitutive kinase activity , failure of met down regulation and interactions with other cell surface receptors such as egfr ( reviewed in [ 8284 ] ) . met is overexpressed in 84% of hnscc patient samples . \n interestingly , amplification of the met gene ( > 10 copies per cell ) is present only in 3 of 23 ( 13% ) tumor tissues . \n hgf overexpression is detected in 45% of hnsccs , suggesting that hgf functions predominantly in a paracrine manner to drive met signaling in these cancers . \n moreover , high levels of hgf are detected in hnscc patient plasma samples   supporting the idea that ligand availability is not a limiting factor for met activation . \n mutations in the met ligand - binding domain ( t230m / e168d ) , transmembrane or jm domain ( r988c , t1010i ) and the tyrosine kinase domain ( t1275i , v14333i ) have also been identified in hnscc tumor samples , although their relative contribution to hnscc progression remains to be determined . \n two somatic met mutations have been detected in hnscc that result in constitutively active receptor signaling that confers an invasive phenotype when ectopically expressed in cell lines . \n the y1230c mutation confers anchorage - independent growth and an invasive phenotype in transfected cells , whereas the y1235d met mutation stimulates epithelial cells to invade reconstituted basement membrane in the absence of hgf . in the case of the mety1235d mutation \n , genomic analyses of hnscc patient samples detected the presence of this mutant allele in 50% of metastatic tumors versus 26% in primary tumors , raising the possibility that this could be a critical genetic lesion for the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype . \n alternatively , increased met signaling could afford hnscc a selective advantage for growth and/or survival in metastatic sites , such as the lymph node and lung . \n indeed several studies indicate that met overexpression correlates highly with lymph node metastasis , pathologic stage , and disease reoccurrence [ 8891 ] . \n moreover , patient survival was significantly reduced in biopsy samples with positive met expression relative to negative met expression , suggesting the association of met with hnscc disease progression . \n consistent with these findings , treatment with the tki pf-2341066 caused a significant reduction in tumor growth , a high level of apoptosis and cellular debris within the tumor using a xenograft animal model for hnscc . \n selective inhibitors of met / hgf signaling include humanized monoclonal antibodies for hgf and met , and small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against met ( figure 1 ) . \n although their efficacy for treating a variety of solid tumors is increasingly recognized , we await results of preclinical and clinical trials for head and neck cancer that are ongoing . \n the humanized antibody amg 102 shows high potency towards the mature and processed form of hgf with no detected effects on proteolytic activation of prohgf . \n amg 102 interferes with met signaling , by competing with hgf for binding to the  chain of the met receptor . in phase \n i clinical studies in patients with advanced solid tumors , 70% of patients had a best response in terms of achieving stable disease [ 93 , 94 ] . \n importantly , no antiamg 102 antibodies were detected and circulating hgf levels were dose dependent . \n another promising clinical therapeutic is the one - armed 5d5 humanized antibody ( oa5d5/metmab ) directed against met . \n metmab binds met with high affinity , preventing hgf binding , met phosphorylation , receptor internalization and downstream signaling events and has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in animal models by more than 95% [ 95 , 96 ] . \n metmab is currently in phase i / ii human clinical trials in comparison with erlotinib in patients with nsclc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00854308 ) . \n future clinical trials will be required to determine the suitability of amg102 and metmab as either single agents or combinatorial therapeutics for treating hnscc patients . \n foretinib ( formerly xl880 ) is a tki whose primary targets include met and vegf , and to a lesser extent the platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) receptor , ron , kit and tie2 rtks . \n foretinib recently completed phase ii clinical trials in head and neck patients ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00725764 ) . \n interim results suggest that after 12 months , 12 of 18 patients had stable disease . \n a phase i dose - escalation study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of xl184 administered orally to patients with advanced malignancies ( showed that , on average , patients survived for more than 3 months with several up to 6 months while on treatment ) ( reviewed in ) . due to \n encouraging data from this study , a randomized phase iii trial of xl184 in hnscc patients was initiated to investigate xl184 as a first - line treatment ( compared with placebo ) for survival benefit to patients with hnscc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00704730 ) . \n arq197 ( arqule ) is a nonatp - site competitive , selective small molecule inhibitor of the met intracellular region . \n although the mechanism of arq197 is presently unknown , the results of phase i trials suggest potential antiinvasive activity for this compound . \n overall , met , and hgf - targeted therapies have been well tolerated in clinical trials with negligible toxicities . \n however , it remains to be determined whether met is a better therapeutic target than hgf . \n clearly , in patients where met is activated by autocrine hgf secretion , both hgf and met targeted therapies may prove to be more efficacious treatment options . \n acquired resistance is likely the result of several mechanisms including ( 1 ) egfr mutations initially present as well as those acquired during therapy , ( 2 ) receptor independent activation of downstream signaling cascades , ( 3 ) cross - talk with other rtks and converging signaling pathways and ( 4 ) environmental factors including inflammatory agents and viral infection . \n resistance to cetuximab has been associated with the coexpression of the truncated egfr mutant , egfrviii with wild - type egfr . \n egfrviii is the result of an in frame deletion of exons 27 spanning the extracellular ligand - binding domain . \n the deletion results in a truncated egfr receptor that signals in a ligand - independent manner . \n egfrviii expression has been detected in 42% of hnscc patient samples , and closely correlates with increased hnscc cell proliferation in vitro and increased tumor growth using in vivo xenograft models . \n egfrviii preferentially activates the pi3k pathway instead of the ras / raf / mek pathway , which is activated by wild - type egfr . of particular interest to the therapeutic treatment of hnscc , \n egfrviii expression decreases the proliferative response of egfr expressing tumor cells to cetuximab treatment relative to vector control cells . in a recent study , \n egfrviii cells were shown to be resistant to the antiinvasive effects of cetuximab due to an increase in phosphorylation of stat3 rather than increased pi3k signaling . \n egf - induced expression of the stat3 target gene hif1 was abolished by cetuximab in hnscc cells expressing wild - type egfr under hypoxic conditions , but not in egfrviii - expressing hnscc cells [ 102 , 103 ] . \n these data suggest a role for egfrviii in mediating hnscc resistance to cetuximab .   despite egfrs critical role in the development of hnscc \n , clinical data indicate modest clinical benefits for locoregional control and survival of head and neck cancer patients treated with egfr - targeted therapies . \n hnscc patients resistant to cetuximab , often succumb to local tumor recurrence as well as regional and distant metastasis . \n the addition of cetuximab to radiation therapy was reported to show improved locoregional disease control , progression - free survival , and overall survival in patients with locally advanced hnscc . \n however the data revealed a disproportionate benefit of cetuximab with radiotherapy to oropharyngeal cancer patients when compared to patients treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy . \n accumulating evidence suggests that human papilloma virus ( hpv ) 16 status ( hpv+ ) is an important prognostic factor associated with a favorable outcome in a subset of head and neck cancers , including oropharyngeal and tonsilar cancers . \n hpv+ tumors tend to have unique genetic aberrations including decreased egfr expression , whereas increased igf-1r levels characteristic of hnscc appear to be independent of hpv status . \n clinically , hpv+ tumors are characterized by more favorable patient prognosis regarding disease - free survival as well as overall survival [ 104 , 105 ] , possibly as a result of increased genomic stability associated with global gene hypermethylation in hpv+ tumors . \n thus it will be interesting to determine whether hpv+ status explains some of the benefits derived from the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy in this subset of hnscc patients . at present \n , there are few clinical indicators of which hnscc patients will most likely respond to egfr - targeted therapies . \n accordingly , strategies to optimize egfr - targeted therapy remain an active area of research . \n additional mechanisms that result in egfr activation include activating mutations in downstream signaling components or cross - talk between different rtk pathways . activating mutations in the pi3ka oncogene \n occurs in 10% of hnscc tumors   whereas elevated levels of phosphorylated stat3 correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor patient prognosis [ 108110 ] . \n conversely , h - ras mutations are infrequent in hnscc cases ( less than 5% ) , although a higher incidence has been detected in asian populations and correlates with areca nut chewing [ 111 , 112 ] . \n met signaling has been shown to contribute to resistance in cell lines derived from multiple tumor types including breast , gastric and lung . \n in one key study , nsclc with activating mutations in the egfr acquire resistance to the tki gefitinib and erlotinib , by amplification of the met gene to maintain akt and her3 signaling . \n these studies underscore the role of cross - talk between rtks to preferentially signal through the pi3k - akt survival pathway as a mechanism for acquired drug resistance . \n the relevance of met as a mechanism for escape from egfr - targeted therapy in head and neck cancers remains to be determined . \n hypoxia results in the transcriptional upregulation of met gene expression via hif1 in a number of tumors including head and neck , often downstream of egfr signaling . in normoxia \n , hydroxylation of 2 prolines in hif1 enables its binding to the von hippel - lindau tumor suppressor protein ( pvhl ) linking hif1 to a ubiquitin ligase complex . during hypoxia , minimal or no hydroxylation occurs enabling hif1 to avoid proteasomal degradation and \n dimerize to other hif family members such as hif1   and coactivators , to form an active transcriptional hif complex on the hypoxia response element ( hre ) of target genes such as met . \n the ubiquitin ligase catalyzes polyubiquitination of hif1 targeting it for proteasomal degradation . under hypoxic conditions , \n increased met signaling directs the invasive growth program , enabling cells to invade more oxygenated tissues . \n since met has been reported to promote invasive and angiogenic effects in the tumor microenvironment , the use of hgf / met inhibitors may afford a means of impairing tissue colonization as well as tumor vascularization in head and neck cancer patients . \n studies on other solid tumor types , most notably glioblastoma , indicate a role for igf-1r upregulation in resistance to egfr - targeted therapies . \n igf-1r mediates resistance to anti - egfr therapy in primary glioblastoma through the continued activation of the pi3k / akt survival pathway . \n the apparent cooperation between igf-1r and egfr in promoting hnscc pathogenesis as well as resistance to egfr - targeted therapy , suggests an advantage to cotargeting these signaling axes for the treatment of head and neck cancers . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer lines . \n treatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] . \n targeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) . \n similarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) . \n these studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of antiigf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc . \n targeted therapies that block egfr , met , and igf-1r signaling in head and neck cancers continue to show promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials . \n however , it is difficult to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapeutics and potential side effects during long - term in vivo use . given the interplay between these rtk signaling pathways and the mediocre results obtained with monotherapy regimens thus far , clinical trials will be required to determine how egfr- , met- , and igf-1r - targeted therapies can be used in combination in order to definitively abrogate their common downstream oncogenic signaling networks . \n although gaps in our knowledge concerning the role of met and igf-1r in head and neck tumorigenesis , as well as acquired resistance to antiegfr therapies remain to be addressed , efforts to translate current information towards clinical applications continue to be impressive .",
         "molecular therapeutics for treating epidermal growth factor receptor-(egfr- ) expressing cancers are a specific method for treating cancers compared to general cell loss with standard cytotoxic therapeutics . \n however , the finding that resistance to such therapy is common in clinical trials now dampens the initial enthusiasm over this targeted treatment . \n yet an improved molecular understanding of other receptor tyrosine kinases known to be active in cancer has revealed a rich network of cross - talk between receptor pathways with a key finding of common downstream signaling pathways . \n such cross talk may represent a key mechanism for resistance to egfr - directed therapy . \n here we review the interplay between egfr and met and the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) tyrosine kinases , as well as their contribution to anti - egfr therapeutic resistance in the context of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck , a tumor known to be primarily driven by egfr - related oncogenic signals .",

induced cell death through activation of enzymatic degradation , preservation of mitochondrial function , and inhibition of apoptotic cell death . \n clearly , mpp was found to significantly decrease the survival of dopaminergic neurons and increase the release of ldh into the culture medium . \n the mpp toxicity involves its selective uptake by dopaminergic neurons through the dopamine transporter and inhibition of mitochondrial complex i activity with subsequent mitochondrial depolarization.14 in parallel , the use of jc-1 fluorescence dye in our current study showed that mpp significantly decreased the m of cultured cells as indicated by the decreasing red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 . \n similar mpp - induced reduction of m was reported in other in vitro disease models.15,16 mitochondrial damage has long been implicated in the death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both pd patients and experimental models.17,18 staining of primary dopaminergic cultures with blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain showed that a significant number of the cells displayed features of apoptosis , most notably chromatin condensation , and fragmentation . \n previously , tang et al19 and xu et al16 demonstrated that mpp caused apoptotic cell death in pc12 and sh - sy5y cells . \n the mpp - induced apoptosis was reported to occur as the result of disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and opening of the permeability transition pore.20 similar to our previous report,9 co - treatment of primary mesencephalic cell cultures with tq and mpp was found to protect dopaminergic neurons and decreased the release of ldh into the culture medium . since that time , no evidence in the literature has shown how tq protected dopaminergic neurons in the primary mesencephalic cell culture . \n staining of cultures with lysotracker deep red showed that tq significantly increased the red fluorescence of the dye compared with mpp - treated cultures , indicating enhancement of the formation of many autophagolysosomes , the sites of lysosomal degradation , by tq . \n this is supported by the findings of he and klionsky21 who correlated the fluorescent signals of lysotracker deep red to the upregulation of autophagy in zebrafish . increased red fluorescence of lysotracker deep red \n is attributed to the formation of many autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes that retain much dye as the result of increasing their acidification . using jc-1 fluorescent dye showed that tq significantly enhanced m as it increased the red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 compared with mpp - treated cultures . \n the tq was similarly found to protect rat cortical neurons against ethanol- and a1 - 42-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of mitochondrial membrane depolarization.22,23 counting of apoptotic nuclei using blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain indicated that tq decreased mpp - induced apoptotic cell death in primary mesencephalic cell cultures . in accordance , \n ullah et al22 reported that tq inhibited apoptotic cell death in ethanol - treated rat cortical neurons and attributed this effect of tq to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity . \n zhang et al24 reported that mitochondrial clearance protected cultured cortical neurons against ischemia - reperfusion - induced cell damage . in conclusion , correlating such results would therefore suggest that tq might activate a lysosomal degradative process in dopaminergic neurons , where clearance of damaged mitochondria results in reduced mitochondria - mediated apoptotic cell death . \n this might raise the possibility of using tq as a potentially therapeutic intervention in pd patients . \n whenever a manuscript contains material ( tables , figures , etc . ) which is protected by copyright ( previously published ) , it is the obligation of the author to obtain written permission from the holder of the copyright ( usually the publisher ) to reproduce the material in neurosciences . \n please submit copies of the material from the source in which it was first published .",

         "the femoral head often leads to healing complications , while the more predictable prosthetic replacements are associated with poorer function and significant complications . \n the treatment of these fractures depends on the age of the patient , fracture displacement , bone quality , timing of surgery and activity level of the patient . \n displaced fractures in healthy , active patients are best treated by reduction and internal fixation . \n there are however , complications unique to femoral neck fractures which are almost impossible to predict . non - union and avascular necrosis \n non - union usually can definitely diagnosed within a year of fracture fixation with the same being achieved within 3  months at times . after non - union has been established , intervention is inevitable . \n the decision to proceed in the management of failed fixation is based on the careful consideration of various factors . in young patients \n revision internal fixation with cancellous or muscle pedicle bone grafting ( vascularised bone graft ) or an osteotomy results in useful outcome . \n we report a case of non - union of the fracture of the neck of the femur , who refused additional procedures after his non - union had been established . \n the study conforms to the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethical board . \n a 38-year old male businessman reported to the out door department of our hospital with a history of a fall from height . \n clinical and radiological examination revealed a displaced fracture of the neck of the femur which was graded as garden type 4 ( fig . \n the patient was operated within 24  h. intraoperatively the garden alignment index was used as a yardstick of acceptable reduction . \n the fracture was fixed with 3 ao 6.5  mm cannulated screws in an inverted triangle . \n onward the patient complained of persistent but mild groin pain on ambulation which was assisted . \n the patients conservative line was continued till 1  year when his symptoms continued and radiologically there was no progress . at this point \n twenty - six  months into the post operative followup the patients pain subsided and radiographs started showing signs of union . a radiograph taken 32  months after the fixation showed full union . \n non - union after femoral neck fracture can be defined as a lack of radiographic evidence of union 6  months after the fracture . \n delayed or non - union often manifests as continued pain with weight bearing beyond 3  months post fixation . \n incidence of non - union of femoral neck fractures has been reported to be between 2 and 22% and generally becomes apparent within 1  year [ 69 ] . \n 3radiograph at 32  months depicting union garden 4 type fracture of the neck of the femur showing persistent non - union at 2  years radiograph at 32  months depicting union anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation are the two important surgeon controlled factors that may contribute to outcome . \n the preferred treatment for symptomatic non - unions in the elderly is prosthetic replacement . in the young active patients , \n if failure is due to technical errors , revision open reduction and internal fixation may be adequate . \n our case demonstrates that as long as the implant is holding and the patient is regularly followed up good results might be expected in cases as far as 32  months into the post fixation period .",
         "fracture of the femoral neck continues to be a vexing clinical and therapeutic challenge for the orthopedic surgeon . \n the fracture has a propensity for non - union and avascular necrosis . \n it is a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon to decide when to intervene in a case with non - union where the implant continues to be in place . \n we present a case with persistent clinical and radiological non - union signs where the fracture eventually united after 32  months . \n the case bolsters the view that a continued conservative regime might entail good results in such situations .",

gamma and il-5 production and release , induced by the down - regulation of the t - cell activity , primarily involving the calcineurin binding and inactivation . \n however , we did observe eosinophils in skin biopsy in our case , probably since the biopsy was taken after one year of oral dapsone . \n our patient experienced a relevant improvement within 3 months of treatment with tacrolimus ointment after no response with intra lesional steroids , dapsone and cryo therapy . in conclusion \n , the previous reports and our observation suggest that topical tacrolimus may be a well -

         "in a recent issue of critical care , we presented a series of 13 patients undergoing post - cardiotomy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) with bivalirudin - based anticoagulation . \n after this series , we satisfactorily continued this experience , reaching about 20 patients treated . \n however , we think that a word of caution should be added to our recently published experience . owing to its pharmacological profile \n , bivalirudin is rapidly cleaved by proteolytic enzymes , and its half - life is about 25 minutes when the renal function is normal . \n the use of bivalirudin for cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb )   and ecmo   is a feasible option . \n however , it is recommended that , during cpb , blood stagnation in the circuit be avoided because the rapid cleavage of bivalirudin may result in thrombosis . \n the ecmo circuit is devoid of a reservoir , and therefore blood stagnation is usually not a circuit- related problem . \n conversely , under some circumstances , the cardiac chambers may act as a ' natural reservoir ' , which entails blood stagnation and the risk for spontaneous intracardiac thrombosis . \n this is particularly true in the case of a very large right or left atrium with insufficient venous drainage or the case of very poor ventricular systolic function with intraventricular blood stagnation . to avoid this condition \n , we think that maintaining a partial ecmo support , leaving a minimal degree of intracardiac blood flow , may be a reasonable choice . \n this may be checked by echocardiographic view of heart valve movement or simply by the observation of some degree of pulsatile arterial blood pressure . \n we think that , in the event of echocardiographic evidence of a ' smoke effect ' within one or more cardiac chambers , bivalirudin should be replaced by standard heparin anticoagulation . \n intracardiac thrombus formation during ecmo with heparin anticoagulation has been described as well , but the pharmacokinetic properties of heparin may limit the risk of thrombus formation due to blood stagnation . \n  \n ",
         "bivalirudin has been proposed as the sole anticoagulant in patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) or cardiopulmonary bypass . \n owing to the pharmacodynamic properties of bivalirudin , areas of blood stagnation should be carefully avoided in order to limit the risk of thrombosis . \n the ecmo circuit has no reservoir and is usually devoid of blood stagnation areas . \n conversely , under some circumstances , intracardiac blood stagnation areas may exist . in this case \n , there is a potential risk for the spontaneous formation of an intracardiac thrombus . \n we suggest that , under bivalirudin anticoagulation , a minimal degree of intracardiac blood flow with left heart valve movement is allowed .",

         "moraxella catarrhalis is a gram - negative , aerobic diplococcus human mucosal pathogen which causes middle ear infections in infants and children [ 13 ] , and it is one of the three major causes of otitis media along with streptococcus pneumonia and haemophilus influenzae . although moraxella catarrhalis is frequently found as a commensal of the upper respiratory tract , recently it has emerged as a genuine pathogen and is now considered an important cause of upper respiratory tract infections in healthy children and elderly people , lower respiratory tract infections in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 1 , 5 ] , and hospital - acquired pneumonia . \n amikacin , cefixime , fosfomycin , cefuroxime , cotrimoxazole , doxycycline , and erythromycin resistant strains of moraxella catarrhalis were isolated and the widespread production of a -1actamase enzyme renders the bacterium resistant to the penicillin [ 79 ] . \n this has led to the search for new and effective therapeutic alternatives among natural compounds . \n plants remain an important source of diverse chemical entities which have been used as drugs or provide scaffolds from which new drugs have been derived . \n the selection of a suitable candidate species for investigations can be done on the basis of long - term use by humans . \n this approach is based on an assumption that the active compounds isolated from such plants are likely to be safer than those derived from plant species with no history of human use . \n aristolochia is an important genus in the family of aristolochiaceae and is widespread across tropical asia , africa , and south america . \n it is used in traditional medicine as a gastric stimulant and in the treatment of cancer , lung inflammation , dysentery , and snakebites . \n it is also used in the treatment of tumors and malaria and for fevers , but its usage as an antimalarial is not recommended in its crude form . \n aristolochia bracteolata showed a definite positive effect on wound healing , with significant increase in the level of powerful antioxidant enzymes . \n the whole plant was used as a purgative , antipyretic , and anti - inflammatory . \n organic solvent extracts of the plant showed antibacterial activities while the water extract showed antifungal activity . \n although aristolochia has been used for thousands of years in many cultures for many indications due to its various pharmacological activities , it was later discovered that consuming these plants can certainly be dangerous . \n the genus of aristolochia contains a naturally carcinogenic compound aa which has been shown to be the cause of so - called chinese herb nephropathy or aa nephropathy [ 19 , 20 ] , and mutations in the cells of people who consume it , causes more mutations than two of the best - known environmental carcinogens : tobacco smoke and uv light [ 21 , 22 ] . \n there are many cases of nephropathy reported in the literature caused by the systemic and long term application of chinese snakeroot ( aristolochia fangchi ) ; this highlighted the risk of using preparations which contain aristolochic acids . \n although aristolochia is being known in many countries that is containing a toxic compound aa , but this has not stopped it from being a popular herbal remedy for thousands of years . \n it is still extensively used in india and in traditional chinese medicine for slimming , menstrual symptoms , and rheumatism . \n it is also widespread used in sudan and other african countries as one of the most effective herbal remedies for infectious diseases . \n therefore , it was our objective to assess the potential antimicrobial activity of aristolochia bracteolata using a bioassay - guided fractionation , in order to produce pure compound that can act as the lead compound in developing new , safe , and effective drug to replace the use of the harmful crude plant material . \n sephadex lh-20 ( pharmacia fine chemical co. ltd ) was used for column chromatography . precoated silica gel plates ( merck , kieselgel 60 f254 , 0.25  mm ) and precoated rp-18 f254s plates ( merck ) were used for thin -

free plates . \n initial steps in new drug discovery involve identification of new chemical entities , which can be either sourced through chemical synthesis or can be isolated from natural products through biological activity guided fractionation . \n bioassay - guided fractionation of the identified plant may lead to standardized extract or isolated bioactive lead compounds as the new drug . \n the whole plant of aristolochia bracteolata was extracted successively with meoh and subjected to liquid - liquid fractionation with n - hexane , chloroform , ethyl acetate , and n - butanol . \n the resulting fractions were tested for antibacterial and antifungal activities . the crude extract and chloroform fraction were significantly active against sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . and both standard strain and clinical isolates of moraxella catarrhalis and were moderately active against s. aureus , b. subtilis , and ps . \n the n - hexane fraction had moderate activity against s. aureus and b. subtilis while ethyl acetate fraction showed moderate activity against ps . \n the crude extract failed to inhibit the growth of all test fungi in addition to the following bacterial strains : klebsiella pneumoniae , escherichia coli , salmonella typhimurium , streptococcus pyogenes , streptococcus agalactiae , staphylococcus epidermidis , neisseria lactamicus , enterobacter cloacae , bacillus cereus , aeromonas hydrophila , salmonella typhi , vibrio cholerae , and yersinia enterocolitica . \n the chloroform soluble fraction was therefore selected for further chromatographic separations and resulted in the isolation of known compound aa-1 ( figure 1 ) . \n aa-1 showed strong activity against moraxella catarrhalis ( standard strain and clinical isolates ) and sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . \n ( table 2 ) , with equal mic and mbc values of 25 and 50  g / ml . both the piperonylic acid moiety of aa-1 ( figure 1 ) and aa-1-methyl ester showed no activity against bacteria ( table 2 ) , which suggests that the coexistence of phenanthrene ring and free carboxylic acid is essential for aa-1 antibacterial activity . \n bioguided fractionation of methanolic extract of aristolochia bracteolata led to isolation of aa-1 and its structure was elucidated by interpretation of its nmr and ms data and by comparison with those reported in the literature . \n electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( esims ) showed pseudomolecular ion signal at m / z 364.03 [ m + na ] and high resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry ( hr - fabms ) afforded m+1 ion signal at m / z 342.0620 which was corresponding to the molecular formula c17h12no7 ( calculated for 342.06138 ) . \n h nmr and c - nmr spectra were matched with those of aa-1 which were previously reported . \n two weak signals which did not show any correlation with proton in hsqc and hmbc spectroscopy were considered as quaternary carbons at positions 5 (  124.3  ppm ) and 6 (  143.5  ppm ) , respectively . \n laboratories of the world have found literally thousands of phytochemicals which have inhibitory effects on all types of microorganisms in vitro . \n more of these compounds should be subjected to animal and human studies to determine their effectiveness in whole - organism systems , including in particular toxicity studies and an examination of their effects on beneficial normal microbiota . in spite of \n the fact that herbal remedy is a mixture of many chemicals in unknown doses and might result in unpleasant side effects , many people believe that treatments that are natural are somehow magically safe and effective . \n aristolochia is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases [ 13 , 15 ] , including those associated with bacteria . \n this study showed clearly that the excellent effect of aristolochia in treating such diseases is due to the toxic compound aa-1 . \n although aa-1 is highly effective in killing m. catarrhalis , it is ineffective against the other microorganisms tested . \n this highlights the importance of m. catarrhalis in discovering the cellular target of aa-1 and the mechanism of aa-1 toxicity . \n the widespread use of aristolochia is not sufficient to ensure that it is effective or even that it is safe . \n therefore , hit - to - lead exploration is necessary to identify related compounds with low toxicity , low cost , and improved potency that can replace the use of the harmful crude plant material . \n it is impossible to ban the use of these remedies , especially in the rural areas in sudan and other african countries ; therefore , we strongly recommend educating the public of the risks versus the benefits of aristolochia and gradually replacing them with either economical new drugs or standardized extracts and homogenous batches of other plant material with known levels of safe active constituents . \n using bioassay - guided fractionation technique , the present study directly linked the antibacterial activity of aristolochia bracteolata to the aa-1 . \n although aa-1 had strong activity against m. catarrhalis , it had a narrow spectrum of activity than expected based on the activity of the crude extract from which it was isolated or from its traditional usage . \n this may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or may be due to placebo effect .",
         "a bioassay - guided fractionation of methanol extract of aristolochia bracteolata whole plant was carried out in order to evaluate its antimicrobial activity and to identify the active compounds in this extract . \n antibacterial and antifungal activities of methanol extract against gram - positive , gram - negative , and fungal strains were investigated by the agar disk diffusion method . among the strains tested , moraxella catarrhalis and sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . \n showed the highest sensitivity towards the methanol extract and hence they are used as test organisms for the bioassay - guided fractionation . from this \n extract , aristolochic acid 1 ( aa-1 ) has been isolated and has showed the greatest antibacterial activity against both standard strain and clinical isolates of moraxella catarrhalis with equal minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) and minimum bactericidal concentration ( mbc ) values of 25 and 50  g / ml . modification of the aa-1 to aa-1 methyl ester completely abolished the antibacterial activity of the compound and the piperonylic acid moiety of aa-1 which suggested that the coexistence of phenanthrene ring and free carboxylic acid is essential for aa-1 antibacterial activity .",

         "anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ancas ) correlate well with a wide spectrum of vasculitis manifestations , including wegener 's granulomatosis , microscopic polyangiitis , and churg - strauss syndrome , all of which are commonly referred to as anca - associated vasculitis ( 1 ) . \n several infections , particularly infective endocarditis , have been reported to show positive findings on anca tests ; furthermore , their clinical features have been acknowledged to mimic anca - associated vasculitis , which may lead to a misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment ( 2,3 ) . \n however , to our knowledge , infected aortic aneurysms have not been reported to show positive findings on anca tests . \n we herein report a patient with an infected thoracic aortic aneurysm mimicking anti - proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( pr3-anca)-associated vasculitis . \n vegetations in the descending aorta , which were detected using transesophageal echocardiography , contributed to the diagnosis in this case . \n a woman in her 60s was admitted to the nagoya city university hospital complaining of a fever , which had persisted for three weeks , along with a loss of appetite , proteinuria , hematuria , and renal dysfunction . \n her renal function test values had been in the normal range three months prior to the admission . \n she also had a history of orbital mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma , which was in remission after treatment with only radiation therapy . \n a physical examination at the time of admission revealed a body temperature of 38.1 , pulse rate 109 beats / min , and blood pressure 104/53 mmhg . \n the laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 18,900/mm , hemoglobin 6.6 g / dl , blood urea nitrogen 30.8 mg / dl , serum creatinine 2.24 mg / dl , and c - reactive protein ( crp ) 9.44 mg / dl ( table ) . \n the pr3-anca titer was 47.4 iu / ml ( normal range < 10 iu / ml ) , although her myeloperoxidase - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( mpo - anca ) titer was not elevated . \n a urinalysis gave results of 2 + for protein and 3 + for occult blood in a dipstick examination , and a microscopic examination detected more than 100 red blood cells per high - power field . \n alt : alanine aminotransferase , ana : antinuclear antibodies , ast : aspartate transaminase , c3 : compliment 3 , c4 : compliment 4 , ch50 : 50% hemolytic unit of complement , crp : c - reactive protein , dna : deoxyribonucleic acid , ldh : lactate dehydrogenase , mpo - anca : myeloperoxidase - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody , rf : rheumatic factor , pr3-anca : anti - proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody she was initially diagnosed with pr3-anca - associated vasculitis and was thereafter treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy ( 500 mg / day ) for three days ( fig . \n however , streptococcus sanguis was serially detected in blood cultures ; therefore , the administration of steroids was stopped . \n transesophageal echocardiography also revealed no vegetation in the heart ; however , it showed many oscillating masses attached to the intima in the descending aorta ( fig . \n 2 ) . contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) revealed a new descending aortic aneurysm ( fig . \n effects of antibiotics on fever and c - reactive protein during hospitalization . the patient finally became afebrile and has c - reactive protein levels within the normal range after receiving antibiotics . \n crp : c - reactive protein , dap : daptomycin , pcg : penicillin g , taz / pipc : tazobactam / piperacillin , tx : therapy transesophageal echocardiographic images of the descending aorta , with sectioning planes at 90 ( a ) and 0 ( b ) . \n many oscillating masses attached to the intima were seen in the lumen of the descending aorta . \n contrast - enhanced computed tomographic images in the axial ( a ) and frontal ( b ) sections . \n these images show a descending aortic pseudoaneurysm and a contrast defect ( arrow ) beside the aneurysm that is compatible with echo - documented vegetation . \n based on the results of microbiological testing , antibiotic treatment with intravenous penicillin g ( 24,000,000 unit / day ) was started , after which she became afebrile . \n we added intravenous daptomycin ( 300 mg every 24 hours ) and tazobactam / piperacillin ( 2.25 g every 6 hours ) to the penicillin g because recurrent fever was observed two weeks later . \n this additional antibiotic treatment made her afebrile again , and her renal function was recovered ( fig . \n , she developed a janeway lesion , which was confirmed by the pathological finding of a skin biopsy specimen ( fig . \n 4 ) . transesophageal echocardiography finally demonstrated that the vegetation had disappeared after the antibiotic treatment ( fig . \n 5 ) , but contrast - enhanced ct revealed that the aneurysm remained unchanged in form . a nontender hemorrhagic macular on the sole of the foot ( a ) . \n photomicrograph of the macular lesion shows microembolization with fibrin and infiltration of neutrophilic cells hematoxylin and eosin staining ( b , c ) . \n a transesophageal echocardiographic image of the descending aorta after the antibiotic treatment , with the sectioning plane at 90. many oscillating masses have disappeared . on the 54th hospital day , she underwent endovascular aortic repair ( evar ) of the aneurysm ( fig . \n 6 ) after confirmation that her crp level was in the normal range and once blood cultures were consistently negative . \n one year after the procedure , she continues to take oral antibiotics ; no complications related to stent - graft deployment or recurrent infections have been encountered . \n her pr3-anca titer has normalized . a contrast - enhanced computed tomographic image after endovascular stent graft repair . \n in this case , an infected aortic aneurysm exhibited elevated the patient 's pr3-anca level , and its clinical course mimicked pr3-anca - associated vasculitis . \n the detection of ancas is highly specific for a diagnosis of anca - associated vasculitis ( 4 ) ; however , a number of infections can result in a positive anca test . \n there are several reports of infective endocarditis with the presence of ancas that mimic the clinical manifestations of an anca - associated vasculitis such as glomerulonephritis ( 2,3 ) . in the present case , based on the finding of positive blood cultures \n , we suspected that the patient was experiencing not anca - associated vasculitis but infective endocarditis . \n however , no vegetations were detected in the cardiac chambers using transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography . \n instead , contrast - enhanced ct revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the descending aorta , which suggested that the patient had an infected aneurysm . \n her renal dysfunction and elevated pr3-anca levels normalized with clinical resolution of the infected aneurysm after the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and evar . \n the patient has remained free of any evidence of systemic vasculitis during follow - up . \n the presence of pr3-anca may have been falsely positive in the present patient . to our knowledge , this is the first report of an infected aortic aneurysm with a positive pr3-anca test and clinical features mimicking anca - associated vasculitis . \n the presence of vegetations in the heart is one of the most characteristic findings of infective endocarditis . \n these vegetations are composed of bacteria , platelets , and inflammatory cells interspersed with fibrin mesh , either on damaged endocardium , including native cardiac valves , or prosthetic valves ( 5 ) . in the present case , \n because these masses disappeared after antibiotic treatment , they were considered to be vegetations . a pathological examination of the macular hemorrhages on the patient 's sole indicated not a cholesterol embolization but rather a janeway lesion , which was the consequence of septic embolic events . \n we therefore suspected that these masses were not mobile plaques but bacterial vegetations . to our knowledge , \n few cases of infected native aortic aneurysm manifesting vegetations in the aneurysm have been reported ( 6 - 8 ) . \n several mechanisms have been proposed regarding how ancas are formed during the course of infection , such as autoantigen complementarity , molecular mimicry , epigenetics , neutrophil extracellular traps , and microbial - sensing proteins called toll - like receptors ( 9 ) . there may be a great degree of overlap in the clinical and laboratory manifestations between anca - associated vasculitis and anca - positive infected aortic aneurysm , potentially leading to a misdiagnosis . \n it is important to correctly diagnose these cases in order to avoid administering inappropriate therapy , such as immunosuppressive treatment , which might have life - threatening consequences in a patient with an infected aortic aneurysm . \n positive blood cultures and imaging findings , such as a pseudoaneurysm and/or vegetations in the aorta , suggest the presence of an infected aortic aneurysm . a combination of conventional surgical treatment with resection of the aneurysm , extensive local debridement , and revascularization by in situ reconstruction or extra - anatomic bypass may be the gold standard , but such a treatment strategy is accompanied by a high mortality and morbidity . in the present case , \n it was recently reported that evar of an infected aortic aneurysm is feasible and , for most patients , a durable treatment option ( 10 ) . \n given that the continuous administration of antibiotics for the infected aneurysm should prevent a recurrence of local infection , we continued using antibiotics until the infection was controlled and carefully monitored the shape of the pseudoaneurysm on contrast - enhanced ct . \n we were ready to perform an emergency surgical correction at any point during this patient 's treatment course . in conclusion \n , we herein reported an unusual case of infected descending aortic pseudoaneurysm with luminal pathognomonic oscillating vegetation and with serological findings and clinical features mimicking pr3-anca - associated vasculitis . \n ",

         "endometriosis is a prevalent cause of infertility , pelvic pain , dysmenorrhea , and dyspareunia in reproductive - age women . \n its diagnosis is by inspection of the pelvis during laparoscopy . in women with pelvic pain and infertility , \n endometriosis mimics some autoimmune and malignant diseases , including familial occurrence and immunological abnormalities in b and t cells , increased angiogenesis , invasion of endometrial cells to adjacent organs ( e.g. , bladder and bowels ) , and need for repeat surgeries due to recurrence [ 1,57 ] . \n multiple mechanisms for etiology and improvement of endometriosis are suggested and the treatments are based on these unclear mechanisms . therefore , progestin , gnrh agonists and antagonists , and drugs related to lipid metabolism ( e.g. , simvastatin ) are used for treatment . \n it has been shown that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of endometriosis , so endometriosis treatment should not be different from that of other inflammatory disorders \n . there may be a correlation between vitamin d levels and the risk of polycystic ovarian disease , endometriosis , breast and ovarian cancer , increased arterial stiffness in older patients , and myasthenia gravis [ 1218 ] . \n it has been found that vitamin d has a role in normal cellular growth regulation . \n vitamin d increases anti - inflammatory cytokines production and decreases pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 1922 ] . \n vitamin d induces apoptosis and suppression of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo [ 2528 ] . \n although an indirect relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been reported in multiple studies , here has been no published randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women . \n we explored the relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis in a double - blind , randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of vitamin d supplementation on cessation of pain in proven endometriosis after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment . \n this randomized , double - blind clinical trial was performed in a single tertiary university hospital from nov 2014 to feb 2016 . to find patients with endometriosis , we did laparoscopy for various indications , including ovarian cyst , infertility , pelvic pain , and dysmenorrhea . \n using laparoscopy , the surgeons diagnosed patients with endometriosis and tried to excise or ablate all diseased tissue . the day before laparoscopy \n , a data collection form was completed by a physician , including the reason for laparoscopy , and the severity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea were estimated using a visual analogue scale test ( vas test ) , with a score of 0 being no pain and a score 10 being the worst pain ever experienced . \n the laparoscopies were done by 2 gynecologic laparoscopic surgeons ; both were involved in each operation and they recorded the severity of endometriosis according to the revised american society for reproductive medicine ( asrm ) classification . in the patients with endometriosis in the second menses after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment , the vas test was repeated . \n patients with vas scores of at least 3 for dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain were invited to participate in this clinical trial , and after consultation we asked them to sign the informed consent . \n the dyspareunia score was not a criterion for entering the study because some of the patients were not married and had not had intercourse . \n women aged 1540 years with proven endometriosis by laparoscopy and a vas test score of 3 or more for dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain at second menses after operative laparoscopy . \n patients with vitamin d treatment in the last 6 months prior to surgery ; patients with known systemic diseases ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes , coronary , renal , and hepatic diseases ) ; patients with known malignancy ; patients with hormonal treatment , including oral contraceptive pills , in the last 6 months . after authorization by the university ethics committee , \n eligible patients were assigned by simple randomization to receive either vitamin d or placebo . in the vitamin d group ( d group ) , we prescribed oral vitamin d 50 000 iu / weekly for 12 weeks ( capsule d - vigel , vitamin d3 50 000 iu , daana pharma co. tabriz - iran ) and in the placebo group ( p group ) we prescribed 1 capsule of placebo ( daana pharma co. tabriz - iran ) weekly for 12 weeks . \n four weeks after the end of the intervention ( 24 weeks after surgical treatment ) , the vas test was repeated for the 2 groups . \n we used the ks test ( one -

up and continued their treatment until the end of the study . \n in this double - blind , randomized clinical trial , at 24 weeks after laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis there was no significant difference between effect of vitamin d3 ( cholecalciferol ) and placebo on severity of dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain . \n this is the first clinical trial on women with endometriosis to explore the possible relationship between vitamin d treatment and relief of endometriosis - related pain . \n our literature search found only studies that were indirectly related to vitamin d and endometriosis [ 2743 ] . \n the etiology of endometriosis is poorly understood , and many etiologic factors have been suggested , including the serum level of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 . \n 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 is a fat - soluble vitamin with an unclear role in endometriosis . \n it is suggested that nuclear vitamin d receptors can have a regulatory role in inflammation and can be used as an index of cellular metabolic health . a study on vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism in endometriosis compared 132 infertile women with endometriosis with 132 fertile women , reporting no significant difference and suggesting that vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis . in some studies , \n higher plasma levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 and higher intake of dairy foods was associated with lower risk of endometriosis . \n conversely , another study compared serum vitamin d levels of 87 women with endometriosis with 53 women without endometriosis ; the mean serum levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 in women with and without endometriosis were 24.914.8 ng / ml and 20.411.8 , respectively ( p=0.05 ) and the study concluded that endometriosis is associated with higher serum levels of vitamin d . \n a systematic review of 10 case - control studies and 1 cohort study on women s diet found that women with endometriosis had lower consumption of vegetables and omega-3 , and reported a significant association between diet and endometriosis . \n vitamin d binding protein ( dbp ) is a plasma glycoprotein that modulates immune and inflammatory responses and also controls transport of vitamin d metabolites and bone development . in a study \n comparing 13 ectopic endometrial tissues and 6 normal endometrial tissues , vitamin d binding protein was significantly higher in the ectopic endometrial tissues ( p<0.05 ) . \n a systematic review of research from 1946 to 2013 on vitamin d and endometriosis reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of vitamin d binding protein . \n another study compared serum and peritoneal levels of dbp in 26 women with endometriosis and 17 women with other benign gynecological conditions and reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of dbp than in the control group . \n a study comparing urinary levels of dbp in 57 women with endometriosis with levels in 38 controls found that the urinary level of dbp was significantly higher in patients with endometriosis . \n a study using a rat model of endometriosis reported that treatment with vitamin d3 produced fibrosis and apoptosis in the stroma of tissues with endometriosis . a study on induced endometriosis in adult balb female mice reported that administration of 100 g / kg / day elocalcitol ( a vitamin d receptor agonist ) for 3 weeks reduced total lesion weight . because a relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been suggested by multiple studies , and since there has been no randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women , we decided to explore this relationship . in the present study on endometriosis - related pain \n , we found no significant difference in results of vitamin d treatment vs. placebo at 24 weeks after surgical diagnosis and treatment . \n vitamin d is a fat - soluble vitamin mainly produced in the body from food and supplements and cutaneous sun exposure . \n vitamin d deficiency is defined as serum 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 levels under 20 ng / ml . \n it is reported in 52% of black and hispanic adolescents in boston and in 48% of girls in maine , and it is seen in 40100% of elderly men and women in the usa and europe . a study in germany found that 57% of people \n 1879 years old were vitamin d deficient . the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency was reported to be 90% in healthy subjects in delhi , india . in a systematic review of 195 studies in 44 countries found that 37.3% of studies found that the mean serum vitamin d levels were less than 20 ng / ml . \n the prevalence in pregnant turkish women was 81.4% . in a study of high school students in iran , \n the serum mean vitamin d level was 14.79.4 ng / ml . in another study in university students in shiraz , iran , 51.2% of female students had low serum levels of vitamin d . because the incidence of vitamin d deficiency in iran is high and we did not check the serum vitamin d levels in samples before intervention , it is possible that this dose and duration of vitamin d prescription was beneficial only for treatment of vitamin d deficiency and not endometriosis . in 1072 women attending an infertility center , \n an in vitro study compared the effect of vitamin d3 on 25 human endometriosis stromal cell cultures ( ovarian endometrioma ) with the effect of vitamin d3 on culture of 20 endometrial samples of non - endometriosis women ; vitamin d3 inhibited proliferation , invasion , and pro - inflammatory cytokine production in endometriosis and reduced production of interleukin 6 and other inflammatory cytokines that stimulate adhesion of endometrial cells to the peritoneal cavity . a study on in vitro effects of vitamin d3 on human endometriosis stromal cells found that vitamin d3 significantly reduced interleukin 1 and tumor necrotizing factor- inflammatory responses , and also reported fewer endometrial stromal cells and reduced dna synthesis . \n the study found significantly lower serum vitamin d3 levels in severe endometriosis compared to normal controls and patients with mild endometriosis . a study in italy investigated the effect of vitamin d on primary dysmenorrhea . \n the samples were 40 women aged 1840 years old with 4 consecutive painful periods in the past 6 months . \n they measured the serum levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d with high - performance liquid chromatography . \n then the women were randomized into a group of 20 women who received a single oral dose of 300 000 iu vitamin d ( cholecalciferol ) at 5 days before their next menstrual cycle and another group of 20 women received placebo . \n there was a negative correlation between the baseline dysmenorrhea pain score and the level of 25 hydroxy vitamin d3 ( r=0.36 , p=0.2 ) . \n the researchers found a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in the vitamin d group in comparison with the placebo group in the next 2 menstruations ( p<0.01 ) . \n they suggested this significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in vitamin d prescription group was due to decreased levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and decreased the biological activity of prostaglandins . \n the samples were not assessed for existing endometriosis . because low levels of serum vitamin d are common in healthy italian pre - menopausal women , these results only show that vitamin d was effective in relieving dysmenorrhea at least for 2 months after treatment in women with or without endometriosis and also in women with or without vitamin d deficiency . \n there may be a relationship between vitamin d and pathogenesis of endometriosis , but in our study vitamin d was not effective in treatment of endometriosis - related pain . \n larger clinical trials are needed to determine the possible effects of vitamin d supplementation in endometriosis treatment . \n the first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our country and worldwide , meaning that a high percentage of our samples may have had vitamin d deficiency , which may have affected the results of our research . \n further clinical trials are needed on the role of vitamin d treatment for endometriosis -

         "it is generally accepted that microleakage between the filling materials and root canal \n walls might adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment . \n therefore , it is critical the complete \n sealing of the root canal system after cleaning and shaping in order to avoid the \n bacterial penetration and re - infection of the root and periapical tissues . \n the association of gutta - percha cones \n and root canal sealer has been traditionally used for this purpose . however , in the last \n decade , the dentin adhesive technology has been incorporated into the root canal filling \n techniques to reduce apical and coronal leakage by bonding to root canal walls . \n etch - and - rinse adhesives have been \n tested with resin cements and the \n combination of a dentin - bonding agent and an epoxy resin - based root canal sealer \n significantly reduced apical leakage . in restorative dentistry , the self - etch adhesive systems have shown less technique \n sensitivity , with reliable long - term performance of a two - step mild self - etch \n adhesive . following this trend , \n pentron clinical technologies \n ( wallingford , ct , usa ) has developed the epiphany system , which contains a self - etch \n primer , a dual - cured composite resin sealer and a polyester - based thermoplastic \n root - filling material ( resilon ; resilon research llc , madison , ct , usa ) . \n according to shipper , et al . \n ( 2004 ) \n this material has been shown to be more resistant to bacterial leakage than epoxy \n resin - based sealers for filling root canals . in endodontics , \n the controversy about the performance of adhesive systems inside the \n root canal remains . despite that , \n other possibility is combining epiphany primer with ah plus in an attempt to add the \n hybridization capacity to the gold standard endodontic sealer . \n the reason for this is \n that the removal of the smear layer with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ) does \n not provide the same etching pattern usually associated with the hybrid layer , which is \n considered an important factor for dentin bonding . \n the majority of studies have evaluated apical or coronal microleakage , and few have \n focused gap formation at the dentin / sealer interface . \n so far , no correlation between microleakage and gap \n formation has been established in the literature . \n thus , it is reasonable to believe that \n the association of both methods would provide a more precise evaluation of the adhesive \n interface . \n the aim of this study was to compare the apical sealing and gap formation of ah \n plus / gutta - percha with epiphany system . \n in addition , the opportunity was taken to assess \n the effect of the association of epiphany primer and ah plus / gutta - percha on apical \n sealing and gap formation . \n the null hypotheses tested were as follows : ( 1 ) there is no \n difference in apical microleakage or ( 2 ) apical gap formation among the experimental \n groups and ( 3 ) there is no correspondence between apical microleakage and the presence \n of gaps . \n thirty - nine lower single - rooted human premolars with straight root canals and fully \n developed apices ( local ethics committee approval 177/05 ) were cleaned and submitted \n to 18.5 kgy gamacell radiation ( nuclear energy research institute , so paulo , \n sp , brazil ) , and stored in saline solution at 4c . \n after endodontic access , \n the real working length ( rwl ) was established 1 mm short of the apical foramen . \n a \n crown - down technique was used ( up to k - file # 50 ) under constant irrigation with 0.5% \n naocl . \n the smear layer was removed with 17% edta ( 5 ml ) and 0.5% naocl ( 5 \n ml ) followed by saline \n solution ( 15 ml ) . \n three coats of nail polish were applied to \n external root surfaces except for the apical 2 mm . \n the teeth were randomly ( http://www.random.org ) divided into \n 3 experimental groups ( n=11 ) . \n the endodontic sealers were \n prepared according to the manufacturer 's instructions and the cold lateral \n condensation filling technique ( lc ) was used according with the following \n description : an iso # 50 master gutta -

values for pearson 's test ( p=0.900 ) and \n deviance ( p=0.852 ) . \n the adjusted model demonstrated that the effect of the type of gap \n on the logit of microleakage is significant when compared to the \n presence of types 1 and 2 ( figure 2b and 2c , respectively ) of gap with the absence of gap \n ( p=0.047 ) . \n the correspondence analysis also showed the association between microleakage \n and both types of apical gaps ( figure 3 ) . \n correspondence analysis of microleakage vs. type of gap : ( inf.0 ) - absence of \n leakage ; ( inf.1 ) - leakage up to the 1 millimeter ; ( inf.2 ) \n leakage \n up to the 2 mm ; ( inf.3 )  leakage up to the 3 \n millimeter ; ( inf.5 )  leakage up to the 5 millimeter ; ( f.0 )  absence \n of gaps ; ( f.1 )  gaps type 1 ; ( f.2 ) - gaps types 1 and 2 . \n the absence of leakage \n is associated with the absence of gap ; leakage up to the 1 millimeter \n is associated with type 1 ; and more extensive leakage is associated with types 1 \n and 2 frequency and type of gaps in the apical 5 mm of root canal fillings percentage of regions with gaps . \n type 0 : absence of gaps ; type 1 : gaps between \n dentin and sealer ; type 2 gaps between sealer and cone the generalized linear model with poisson distribution ( table 1 ) found no difference between ah plus and ah primer ( p=0.497 ) in \n distribution of each type of gap , but they presented more type 0 regions \n ( p<0.001 ) . \n there was a significant interaction between epiphany and the type of \n gap ( p<0.003 ) and for this group , there were more type 1 regions . \n based on the findings of this study , the first null hypothesis could not be rejected . \n recently some studies have shown similar results between ah plus and epiphany on apical \n sealing ability using the fluid filtration method . \n consistent with these \n studies , our results indicate that the epiphany system is as effective as ah \n plus / gutta - percha in preventing microleakage based on the chemical tracer penetration \n analysis by sem and the use of epiphany primer does not reduce the microleakage of ah \n plus . nevertheless , other researches pointed out that the epiphany system provided the \n greatest resistance to the movement of fluids or dye leakage \n test , when compared to epoxy \n resin - based root canal sealers , but others have just indicated the opposite . \n these apparent discrepancies can perhaps be explained by the \n methodology used and their variables . \n these results agree with those of previous studies in which , microleakage markers were \n used to evaluate apical sealing of the same endodontic sealers . \n the tracer \n selected was agno3 , which may penetrate into dentinal tubules due to their \n physical and chemical characteristics including : concentration , smaller molecular size , \n its neutral ph , diffusion coefficient and service life up to 168 h post - preparation time of \n solution . \n another reason for \n this choice is that metallic silver deposits may be observed by sem using back scattered \n electrons ( bse ) mode . on the other hand , \n the results of the current study disagree with the findings of \n shipper , et al . \n an \n explanation for this would be that their studies have evaluated coronal and not apical \n bacterial leakage . indeed , coronal seal might be favorably influenced by photoactivation \n of the material which is unlikely to occur in the apical third . \n furthermore , it is speculated that in in \n vivo studies ( dogs ) , the high release of calcium hydroxide ( 41.46 mg / l ) that \n would occur during the process of epiphany sealer solubilization , would make the medium \n alkaline , resulting in acceleration of the periapical tissue repair process . \n this study has shown that the presence of apical gaps at the sealer / dentin or \n sealer / cone interfaces had an effect on apical microleakage . \n the epiphany group \n presented more type 1 gaps than the other groups ( table \n 1 ) , rejecting the second null hypothesis . \n these results corroborate with \n previous observation of gaps in the apical 4 mm of epiphany or ah plus - filled root \n canals . \n stress generated \n during the polymerization shrinkage of epiphany sealer has probably influenced the \n integrity loss at the sealer / dentin interface . \n in addition , the cavity configuration factor ( c - factor ) is \n highly unfavorable for adhesion inside root canals . \n moreover , it is known that analysis of gap formation of \n vertically sectioned root filled teeth hides the risk of artifacts during sectioning . \n therefore , in this study , the sections were made at low speed under water cooling . \n the \n resin - epoxy replicas at the dentin / sealer and sealer / cone interfaces were made before \n the specimens had been prepared for sem examination in order to differentiate genuine \n gaps from artifactual gaps created after vacuum desiccation in conventional scanning \n electron microscopes . \n few studies have focused on apical sealing from two separate perspectives , such as \n microleakage and apical gap formation . \n sem was used to evaluate these perspectives , but it was restricted to a descriptive \n approach . \n a systematization of the observations , complemented by a statistical analysis , such as \n the one performed in this study , could provide greater methodological accuracy and \n impartiality for comparing the experimental groups . \n the correspondence of analysis \n between the types of gaps and linear extent of agno3 leakage ( fig . \n 3 ) confirms the effect of gaps on apical \n microleakage , expressed by the silver deposition into gaps that extended deeply inside \n dentinal tubules ( fig . \n regarding to statistical analysis , the ordinal logistic regression analysis model was \n used due to microleakage was considered categorized ordinal response variable ( ranging \n from 0 - no leakage to 5 - leakage up to the fifth millimeter ) . \n the correspondence \n analysis is a method that leads to visualize the association between two categorical \n variables , in this case microleakage and the type of gap . \n the generalized linear model \n with poisson which is an extension of usual regression model was performed to quantify \n the distribution of types of gaps . \n this result could be explained by two hypotheses : ( 1 ) \n the low degree of conversion of the epiphany sealer and ( 2 ) the formation of hydrogel at the bond interface resulting \n from the incomplete evaporation of the epiphany primer solvent . \n the second hypothesis could also explain the inefficacy \n of epiphany primer in improving the sealing capacity of ah plus . \n moreover , there is a \n chemical incompatibility between these two materials , since the epoxy resin sealers do \n not copolymerize with methacrylate resin - based adhesives . \n other studies should be carried out to clarify the \n sealing ability of the root - filled materials studied . \n it may be concluded that none of the tested materials completely sealed the apical 5 mm . \n the presence \n of gaps had an effect on apical microleakage for all materials . comparing the materials , \n epiphany system presented more regions containing gaps between the dentin and the sealer \n ( type 1 ) . in view of these findings , \n clinically , it can be suggested that ah plus would \n provide a better apical seal . \n this study was partially supported by capes ( coordenao de \n aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior)/institutional \n qualification program ( pqi n : 0090/03 -

these first adhesions are , however mechanically and biologically unstable . \n few minutes after this first , reversible phase , bacterial clusters attached to the surface starts to express biofilm related genes , produce glycocalyx and form mature biofilm , thus transforming the adhesion from reversible to irreversible 16 . \n full - formed biofilm can be found few hours after the first bacterial adhesion 17 . \n antimicrobial surface coatings can be based on an anti - adhesive principle that prevents bacteria to adhere and form biofilms 18 . \n in fact , some polymer coatings , like the hydrophilic polymethacrylic acid , polyethylene oxide or protein - resistant polyethylene glycol can be applied to the surface of titanium implants and result in significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion 19 - 22 . \n hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surface treatment technologies have also shown a great repellent antibacterial effect in preclinical studies 23 - 25 . \n however , clinical application of completely novel coating technologies and compounds , not otherwise previously tested in humans , appears particularly challenging 26 . \n bacterial colonization can also be blocked by an inhibitor interfering with ligand - receptor interaction for bacterial attachment . \n one of these inhibitors could be hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , a glycosaminoglycan made up of glucuronic acid and n - acetylglucosamine disaccharide units . \n it is a uniform , linear and unbranched molecule , with highly variable length and molecular weight ( up to 106 da ) . \n it is abundant in skin ( up to 56% ) and in connective tissues , with a turnover ranging from several hours to a few days depending on tissues . \n hyaluronic acid constitutes one of the main components of extracellular matrices . because of its biological properties , ha has several clinical applications ( aesthetic surgery , dermatology , dentistry , orthopedics and opthalmology ) 27 . \n extensive studies on the chemical and physicochemical properties of ha and its physiological role in humans , together with its versatile properties , such as its biocompatibility , non - immunogenicity , biodegradability , and viscoelasticity , have proved that it is an ideal biomaterial for medical and pharmaceutical applications 28 , 29 . among its various properties , \n several studies have recently shown the ability of ha to protect against various infectious agents 30 , depending on ha concentration and molecular weight 31 , 32 , while more recently ha interference on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has been extensively investigated 33 . \n given its high biocompatibility and well known safety profile and the anti - adhesive capabilities , ha and its composites represent an attractive , non - antibiotic , option to mitigate the impact of biofilm - related infections in various clinical settings including implant - related infections . aim of this review is to provide an update of the current evidence concerning ha ability to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation . \n nearly two decades ago , pavesio et al . 34 were probably the first to describe the ability of ha to resist bacterial adhesion , with particular reference to staphylococcus epidermidis , and its non - fouling properties 35 , proposing coated polymeric medical devices ( e.g. , intraocular lenses , stents and catheters ) to reduce implant - related infections . \n in particular , a hydrophilic ha overlayer , linked to the surface of polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses ( iols ) , was shown to be able to prevent fibroblasts adhesion and to greatly reduce staphyloccous epidermidis adhesion to the implant surface 36 . \n the impact of slime dispersants and anti - adhesives on in vitro biofilm formation on iols was further investigated by kadry and co - workers 37 , using a staphyloccous epidermidis wild strain , isolated from a patient with endophtalmitis ; the authors reported the ability of hyaluronan to reduce bacterial adhesion to iols to 30% , compared with untreated control cells . \n the authors suggested the use of adjuvant therapy such as dispersants or anti - adhesives , in addition to the antibiotics in irrigating solutions for bacterial ocular infections . \n more recently , the in vitro antiadhesive and antibiofilm activity of hyaluronic acid towards bacterial species commonly isolated from respiratory infections was investigated by drago et al . \n 33 . in this study , the interference exerted on bacterial adhesion was evaluated by using hep-2 cells , while the antibiofilm activity was assessed by means of spectrophotometry after incubation of biofilm with hyaluronic acid and staining with crystal violet . \n the experimental findings clearly demonstrated how hyaluronic acid is able to interfere with bacterial adhesion to a cellular substrate in a concentration - dependent manner . \n moreover , staphylococcus aureus biofilm was found to be more sensitive to the action of ha , compared to that produced by haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis . concerning more specifically the antimicrobial activity , ha \n has also been shown to exert varied bacteriostatic , but not bactericidal , dose - dependent effects on different microorganisms in the planktonic phase 31 , 38 . in this \n regard , radaeva et al . reported the inhibiting activity of ha with respect to some pseudomonas species 39 , while ardizzoni and co - workers 30 investigated the effects of ha on 15 atcc bacterial strains , representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species . \n their results showed that different microbial species and , sometimes , different strains belonging to the same species , are differently affected by ha . in particular , staphylococci , enterococci , streptococcus mutans , two escherichia coli strains , pseudomonas aeruginosa , candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose - dependent growth inhibition , while no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans and s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose . comparing the potential bacteriostatic effect of some of the most commonly used biomatrix materials ( collagen type i , hyaluronic acid , hydroxyapatite , polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid ) on the growth over the first 12h of exposure of some of the most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens ( staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus epidermidis , -hemolytic streptococcus , pseudomonas aeruginosa ) , carlson and co - workers 38 found that ha had the most significant bacteriostatic properties on the studied organisms . \n 31 investigated the potential bacteriostatic effect of hyaluronic acid in different concentrations and molecular weight on oral and non - oral microorganisms ( staphylococcus aureus , propionibacterium acnes , actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , pavotella oris and porphyromonas gingivalis ) with potential application in dentistry surgery ; the results showed that different hyaluronan solutions exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains . \n the authors concluded that the clinical application of hyaluronan in form of membranes , gels , or sponges during surgical therapy may reduce bacterial contamination of the surgical wound , thereby lessening the risk of postsurgical infection and promoting more predictable regeneration . \n concerning possible orthopaedic applications , in 2004 harris and richards 40 showed the visualization and quantification of s. aureus adhering to a variety of different treated / coated titanium surfaces . in their study , \n coating titanium with sodium hyaluronate significantly decreased the density of s. aureus adhering to the surfaces and its potential use in osteosynthesis , orthopaedics or dental applications was suggested out . in a very recent review on polysaccharide - based coatings , that have been proposed over the last ten years to impede biofilm formation on material surfaces exposed to bacterial contamination , \n hyaluronic acid was discussed as one of the most studied , with demonstrated non - fouling properties on glass surfaces 41 ; displaying hydrophilic characteristics ( contact angle of 22 ) , this coating was in fact reported to reduce adhesion of s. epidermidis and e. coli by several orders of magnitude compared to the unmodified glass slide . \n similarly , adhesion of s. aureus on ti foils functionalized with hyaluronic acid - catechol was lower than on pristine substrates . \n based on ha antiadhesive properties , a novel ha - based hydrogel has been recently proposed , in order to protect implanted biomaterials in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery from bacterial colonization 42 ; this fast - resorbable hydrogel coating , composed of covalently linked hyaluronan and poly - d , l - lactide (  defensive antibacterial coating  , dac , novagenit srl , mezzolombardo , italy ) , has been found to have a synergistic antibiofilm activity with various antibacterials and able to be effectively manually spread onto the surface of various biomaterials commonly used in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery 43 ( fig . \n 1 ) . the ability to completely cover even sand - blasted titanium surface and resist scraping has in fact been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) analysis ( cf . \n this is an important requirement in order to reduce the exposed surface of a biomaterial , thus creating a uniform coating of the surface and leaving no pores or cracks that could eventually be colonized by planktonic bacteria . in unpublished experiments ( novagenit srl , data on file ) , in order to evaluate dac ability to prevent bacterial adhesion , 200 mg of hydrogel were homogenously spread on the surface of sterile titanium discs . \n hydrogel - coated substrates and uncoated substrates ( controls ) were then placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells for 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes . \n the remaining adhered cells were detached by adding a solution of 0.1% w / v dithiothreitol ( dtt ) ( sigma - aldrich , milan , italy ) to each well and stirring for 15 minutes at room temperature . \n then , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tryptic soy agar ( tsa ; merck , darmstadt , germany ) and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts . \n the results showed that the adhesion density of s. aureus on titanium discs pre - treated with dac , was significantly lower than adhesion on untreated controls at each time point ( fig . \n 2 ) . in particular , reductions of adhered bacteria equal to 86.8% , 80.4% , \n 74.6% and 66.7% vs untreated discs were observed after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of incubation , respectively , while an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and pre - treated discs ( fig . \n further analyses were conducted to show the ability to dislodge previously adhered bacteria ; to this aim , titanium discs were placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells in order to allow the adhesion of bacterial cells . \n afterwards , 200 mg of hydrogel were spread on the surface of contaminated titanium discs in order to remove previously adhered bacteria . \n non - adherent bacteria were removed by rinsing with sterile saline , while the remaining adhered cells were detached by adding 0.1% dtt as previously described . \n then , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tsa and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts . \n the results showed that dac hydrogel treatment of discs reduced the amount of adhered bacteria in respect to control discs after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of 84.0% , 72.8% , 72.3% and 64.3% , respectively ( fig.4 ) . \n once again , an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and treated discs ( fig . \n dac hydrogel showed similar or superior in vitro activity , compared to various antibacterials and a synergistic activity when used in combination ( fig . \n were grown on chrome - cobalt devices in 6-wells polystyrene plates containing tsb for 24 hours at 37c . \n then , growth medium was removed together with non - adherent bacteria and new broth added . \n the plates were incubated at 37c in ambient air , until a visible biofilm was obtained . \n gentamycin and vancomycin were tested at a final concentration of 20 mg / ml . similarly , when mixed with the hydrogel , 60 mg of gel powder were reconstituted with 1 ml of water for injections containing gentamicin or vancomycin at 20 mg / ml concentration . \n amount of biofilm at each time was determined before hydrogel and antibiotic agents addition and after 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 and 48 hours of incubation by a spectrophotometric assay . \n in particular , at each time , broth was removed and biofilm stained with crystal violet . \n after elution of the stain from implants with absolute ethanol , the amount of biofilm was quantified by reading optical density ( o.d . ) at a wavelength of 595 nm against blank ( consisting of ethanol ) . \n amount of biofilm at each time was compared with that formed on the same type of implant before treatment . \n each assay was performed in duplicate and repeated for three times . at each time point , both for gentamycin and vancomycin showed only a partial inhibition of biofilm formation ( ca . \n 40 - 50% for vancomycin ) , with minor difference between the two studied microorganisms . on the other side , \n 50% in comparison to the untreated controls , while a combination of the hydrogel with either antibacterial resulted in a larger reduction of biofilm formation ( approximately 75 to 80% in comparison with untreated controls ) . \n both these experimental studies show the ability of the dac hydrogel to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of common bacterial pathogens , thus potentially providing an effective protection of the implant ; however , these data also point out how , in the clinical setting , in the absence of an adequate immune response from the host and/or of sufficient local levels of antibiotics , a passive antiadhesive coating 18 like ha can be overcome by the remaining bacteria in a time - dependent manner . \n for this reason , any passive antiadhesive coating of implants 44 should probably better be seen as a tool to reduce and delay bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation to a variable degree , also depending on the local environment , the contaminating bacterial species and initial bacterial load ; this may still provide an additional advantage to the host 's cells to first colonize the implanted biomaterial and win the competition with the microorganisms that may eventually be present , thus contributing to reduce the occurrence of implant - related infections . \n several clinical local applications of ha to reduce the impact of biofilm - related infections have been reported , in different clinical settings , with favourable results and no adverse events . \n 45 recently described topical administration of hyaluronic acid in children with recurrent or chronic middle ear inflammations and chronic adenoiditis . in this prospective , single - blind , randomised controlled study , otoscopy , tympanometry and pure - tone audiometry in children which received the daily topical administration of normal 0.9% sodium chloride saline solution ( control group ) or 9 mg of sodium hyaluronate in 3 ml of a 0.9% sodium saline solution was performed . \n the final analysis was based on 116 children ( 49.1% boys ; mean age , 62.9  17.9 months ) : 58 in the control group and 58 in the study group . at the end of follow - up , \n the prevalence of patients with impaired otoscopy was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.024 ) compared to baseline but not in the control group . in comparison with baseline , \n the prevalence of patients with impaired tympanometry at the end of the follow - up period was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.047 ) but not in the control group . \n the reduction in the prevalence of patients with conductive hearing loss ( chl ) ( p value = 0.008 ) and those with moderate chl ( p value = 0.048 ) was significant in the study group , but not in the control group . \n the mean auditory threshold had also significantly improved by the end of treatment in the study group ( p value = 0.004 ) but not in the control group . \n several studies have also reported the beneficial effect of topical ha in chronic urinary tract infections ( uti ) . \n in contrast to traditional antibiotic therapy , which aims at eradicating pathogens , treatment with ha targets bacterial adherence to the bladder mucosa with the presumption that a damaged glycosaminoglycan mucous layer facilitates bacterial adherence and therefore recurrent uti 46 . among others 47 , 48 , \n lipovac and colleagues evaluated the efficacy of nine ha bladder instillations over 6 months in 20 women with a history of recurrent uti . \n their status was assessed prospectively but compared with a retrospective review of patients ' charts . \n the number of infections per year per patient was significantly reduced ( from 4.990.92 to 0.560.82 , p>0.001 ) and the mean time to recurrence ( from 76.724.6 to 178.325.5 days , p>0.001 ) was prolonged significantly . \n nevertheless 65% of treated patients were free of recurrences until the end of study ( 47.6 weeks ) 49 . \n were able to provide a higher level of evidence by reporting a prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , in which a significant reduction of 77% ( p<0.0002 ) in the uti rate per patient per year versus placebo was observed at the end of the study . \n moreover , mean time to uti recurrence was significantly prolonged ( 185.278.7 versus 52.733.4 days , p<0.001 ) after treatment compared with placebo . \n overall urinary symptoms and quality of life measured by questionnaires significantly improved compared with placebo 50 . \n very recently a multicentre european study confirmed the efficacy of intravesical administration of combined hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate ( cs ) for the treatment of female recurrent urinary tract infections 51 . \n a total of 276 adult women received intravesical administration of ha+cs or standard of care ( antimicrobial/ immunoactive prophylaxis/ probiotics / cranberry ) . at follow - up , \n 181 patients treated with ha+cs and 95 patients treated with standard of care from 7 centres were available . \n the crude and adjusted ors ( 95% ci ) for bacteriologically confirmed recurrence within 12 months were 0.77 ( 0.46 to 1.28 ) and 0.51 ( 0.27 to 0.96 ) , respectively . \n studies were also undertaken to determine the effect on clinical variables , sub - gingival bacteria and local immune response brought about by application of hyaluronan - containing gels in early wound healing after scaling and root planing ( srp ) in dentistry 52 , 53 . in the study reported from eick et al . \n the exclusion criteria were : antibiotics intake in the 6 months before the study , periodontal treatment received during the previous year , pregnancy , nursing , smoking , chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis , and allergy to ingredients in the drug . in the test group ( n=17 ) , a 0.8% hyaluronan - containing gels ( ha ) was introduced into all periodontal pockets during srp and a 0.2% ha gel was applied by the patients onto the gingival margin twice daily during the following 2 weeks while the control group ( n=17 ) was treated with srp only ; no placebo was used . probing depth ( pd ) and clinical attachment level ( cal ) \n were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months , and subgingival plaque and sulcus fluid samples were taken for microbiologic and biochemical analysis . in both groups , pd and cal \n the changes in pd and the reduction of the number of pockets with pd5 mm were significantly higher in the test group after 3 ( p=0.014 and 0.021 ) and 6 ( p=0.046 and 0.045 ) months . \n six months after srp , the counts of treponema denticola were significantly reduced in both groups ( both p=0.043 ) , as were those of campylobacter rectus in the test group only ( p=0.028 ) . \n although to date no surface modification has been reported to be able to fully prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 55 , available data show that hyaluronic acid has a proven in vitro antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect against some of the most common pathogens and it has been used safely , alone or in combination with other polymers , with satisfactory results in different conditions associated with biofilm - related chronic infections . \n clinical data in various applications , including dentistry , urology , wound management , dermatology and orthopedics , allow to consider the potential use of ha as a protective coating barrier of implants particularly safe and feasible on a large scale basis . \n while antibacterial coatings to mitigate the occurrence of implant- and biofilm - related infections are regarded as one of the most needed technology , currently only few and insufficient options are available for clinical use in orthopedics and trauma surgery 18 . \n considering the pathogenesis of implant - related infections , any protection offered by a fully biocompatible antiadhesive barrier , like ha and some of its derivatives , could be extremely useful to reduce the tremendous burden of implant - related infections . \n on the other hand , it should be noted that hyaluronic acid as a passive protective barrier has some limits . among others , \n the antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect is limited and may vary , depending on the type of the microorganism , the bacterial load , the local environment , etc . \n ; moreover , ha protection may be neutralized by the possible ability of some bacteria to produce hyaluronidase , an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of hyaluronic acid 56 , while collagen and hyaluronan may even become possible ligands for microbial attachment in particular situations 57 , 58 . \n to overcome at least some of these limits , possible loading of hyaluronic - based hydrogels with antibiotics is technically feasible and has been proposed by different authors 59 - 62 , being a possible option for future developments and large scale clinical applications , provided that regulatory requirements can be met .",
         "living in biofilms is probably the most common condition for bacteria and fungi and biofilm - related infections account for the majority of bacterial infectious diseases worldwide.among others biofilm - related infections , those associated with implanted biomaterials have an enormous and still largely underestimated impact in orthopaedics and trauma , cardio - surgery and several other surgical disciplines.given the limited efficacy of existing antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of bacterial biofilms , new strategies are needed to protect implants and host tissues , overcoming the striking ability of the microorganisms to adhere on different surfaces and to immediately protect themselves by forming the biofilm matrix.adhesion is a necessary first step in microbial colonization and pathogenesis and provides a potential target for new preventive and treatment approach.among various polymers , tested as antibacterial coatings , hyaluronic acid and some of its composites do offer a well - established long - term safety profile and a proven ability to reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.aim of the present review is to summarize the available evidence concerning the antiadhesion / antibiofilm activity of hyaluronic acid and some of its derivatives to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in various experimental and clinical settings .",

         "in 2011 , who declared  combat drug resistance : no action today , no cure tomorrow .  . in recent years \n presently , antimicrobial resistance ( amr ) poses a major threat to patient 's treatment as it leads to increased morbidity and mortality , increased hospital stay , and severe economic loss to the patient and nation [ 3 , 4 ] . \n the clinical isolates such as pseudomonas aeruginosa , methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , enterococci especially vancomycin resistant enterococci ( vre ) , and members of family enterobacteriaceae , for example , klebsiella pneumoniae , e. coli , and proteus sp . \n in the last two decades , there were so much increase of infectious diseases that the standard of public health in many parts of the world is equivalent to preantibiotic era . \n as per standardized international terminology created by european centre for disease control ( ecdc ) and centre for disease control & prevention ( cdc ) , atlanta , the multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) , extensively drug - resistant ( xdr ) , and pandrug - resistant ( pdr ) bacteria have been well defined . \n multidrug resistant ( mdr ) was defined as acquired nonsusceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories . extensively drug \n resistant ( xdr ) was defined as nonsusceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories ( i.e. , bacterial isolates remain susceptible to only one or two antimicrobial categories ) . \n pandrug resistant ( pdr ) was defined as nonsusceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories . \n hence , this short term study was undertaken to detect the incidence of mdr , xdr , and pdr bacterial isolates in a tertiary care hospital of central india . \n this short term cross -

mdr strains isolated , \n the commonest mdr strains were detected from e. coli 79/250 ( 31.6% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 75/250 ( 30% ) . \n similarly , out of 90 gnb - xdr strains isolated , the commonest xdr strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa 29/90 ( 32.2% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 25/90 ( 27.8% ) . in the present study , 137 ( 18.4% ) \n others include wards like dermatology , pulmonary medicine , orthopedics , and cardiovascular and thoracic surgery ( cvts ) . \n the different icus include neonatal icu ( nicu ) , medicine icu ( micu ) , operation theatre icu ( ot icu ) , and paediatric icu ( picu ) . \n out of total 393 mdr strains detected , 127 ( 32.3% ) ( the highest number ) mdr strains were isolated from surgery wards followed by 72 ( 18.3% ) mdr strains from different icus . \n amongst total 146 xdr strains isolated , 41 ( 28.1% ) ( the highest number ) were isolated from surgery wards also . \n out of 72 mdr strains detected from different icus , 29 ( 40.3% ) ( the highest number ) mdr strains were isolated from nicu , followed by 20 ( 27.8% ) and 18 ( 25% ) from ot icu , and only 5 ( 6.9% ) from picu . even in the total 26 xdr strains isolated from different icus , 10 ( 38.5% ) ( the highest number ) \n the percentage of mdr and xdr strains isolated from different icus was 72/138 ( 52.2% ) and 26/138 ( 18.8% ) , respectively , which were again much more than mdr and xdr strains isolated from wards 321/742 ( 43.3% ) and 120/742 ( 16.2% ) , respectively . \n 275 patients were admitted to nicu , of whom 29 ( 10.5% ) were positive for mdr strains and 10 ( 3.6% ) were positive for xdr strains . out of total 1907 \n patients admitted to surgery ward , 127 ( 6.7% ) were positive for mdr strains whereas 41 ( 2.1% ) were positive for xdr strains . in micu , \n 545 patients were admitted and 20 ( 3.7% ) were positive for mdr strains and 8 ( 1.5% ) were positive for xdr strains . \n the clinical and financial burden to patients and health care providers for mdros is really challenging . \n barbara soule , joint commission resources practice leader , infection prevention and control services , has told , \n patients who are infected with mdros often have an increased risk of prolonged illness and mortality . \n the cost of care for these patients can be more than double as compared to those without mdro infection  . since the year 2000 , only 4 new classes of antibiotics have been approved by food and drug administration ( fda ) , us , for example , linezolid , streptogramins , daptomycin , and tigecycline . \n the problem is that the bacteria are developing resistance at a much faster pace than the new drug development . regarding public health attention , mdros are described as superbugs having very limited treatment options . for some mdros \n , only 1 or 2 antibiotics can be effective with toxic side effects . in 2009 , boucher et al . \n have reported eskape organisms as  bad bugs ,  where e stands for enterococcus faecium , s for staphylococcus aureus , k for klebsiella pneumoniae , a for acinetobacter baumannii , p for pseudomonas aeruginosa , and e for enterobacter species . in the year 2009 only \n , peterson has reported the escape group of organism , which was the same as the above list but k was replaced by c , that is , clostridium difficile , and the last e stands for enterobacteriaceae . in the present study , amongst 250 gnb - mdr strains isolated , the commonest mdr strains were detected from e. coli 79/250 ( 31.6% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 75/250 ( 30% ) . \n similarly , out of 90 gnb - xdr strains isolated , the commonest xdr strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa 29/90 ( 32.2% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 25/90 ( 27.8% ) . \n aly and balkhy reported that most prevalent mdro in their study was e. coli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae . in another study , carried out in a tertiary care hospital in riyadh \n , it has been reported that most frequent mdr pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by e. coli . \n the percentage of mdr e. coli strains was more than klebsiella pneumoniae and even pseudomonas aeruginosa in our study probably because a total number of e. coli strains isolated ( 261 ) were also higher . \n the slightly increased incidence of drug resistant strains observed in our study may be because our hospital is a tertiary care center in a rural setup and patients from adjoining districts and even villages are admitted for treatment . before attending the hospital , most of the patients get different antibiotics from general practitioners or due to over - the - counter sell of antibiotics often in improper dose . \n the limitation of this study is that this is a single center study for only three - month period in a tertiary care hospital in central india . to reflect the trend of infections caused by mdr and xdr strains of bacteria in the region , a multicenter study involving all types of healthcare setups for a minimum period of one year \n there is paucity of data regarding mdros in health care setup not only in india but also worldwide . \n unless and until multidrug resistant organisms are detected and their incidence is known , the strategies for their control can not be adopted properly in healthcare setup . hence , detection , prevention of transmission of mdros by following infection control practices , antimicrobial surveillance , and stewardship are need of the hour . \n misuse and overuse of antibiotics , over - the - counter selling of antibiotics without prescription to common people , must be stopped by strict implementations of rules and regulations . \n we hereby conclude that early detection and close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr bacterial strains must be started by all clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance which is now a global problem .",
         "background and objective . \n antimicrobial resistance is now a major challenge to clinicians for treating patients . \n hence , this short term study was undertaken to detect the incidence of multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) , extensively drug - resistant ( xdr ) , and pandrug - resistant ( pdr ) bacterial isolates in a tertiary care hospital . \n material and methods . \n the clinical samples were cultured and bacterial strains were identified in the department of microbiology . \n the antibiotic susceptibility profile of different bacterial isolates was studied to detect mdr , xdr , and pdr bacteria . \n results . the antibiotic susceptibility profile of 1060 bacterial strains was studied . \n 393 ( 37.1% ) bacterial strains were mdr , 146 ( 13.8% ) strains were xdr , and no pdr was isolated . \n all ( 100% ) gram negative bacterial strains were sensitive to colistin whereas all ( 100% ) gram positive bacterial strains were sensitive to vancomycin . \n conclusion . \n close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr must be done by all clinical microbiology laboratories to implement effective measures to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance .",

         "ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder . \n the abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection ( uti ) , which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney . \n this abnormality can be suspected in the fetus by antenatal ultrasonography ( usg ) and confirmed by other x - ray investigations after birth . \n the incidence of ureterocele is variable with the highest rate of 1:500 and it is generally found in females with duplex system association ( 95% ) . \n ureteroceles can have different clinical presentations , such as antenatal hydronephrosis , uti , vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) , bladder outlet obstruction , prolapsed urethral mass , etc . \n usg and voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) are essential initial procedures for a child suspected of having a ureteral anomaly . \n a 5-year - old female child was referred to our department for tc - diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ( dtpa ) scan . \n she was a follow - up case of right - sided hydroureteronephrosis with pyonephrosis with percutaneous tube ( pcn ) insertion done on the right side . \n patient 's blood urea and serum creatinine were 29 and 1.3 mg / dl , respectively . \n usg of the abdomen revealed left - sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and gross enlargement of the right kidney , reaching up to lower abdomen with dilated pelvis and ureter . \n the child was referred for evaluation of glomerular filtration rate and excretory function of kidneys . \n tc - dtpa scan was done in our department with right pcn tube in situ . \n pcn tube was clamped during the acquisition of dynamic and prevoid static image and clamp released thereafter . on tc - dtpa scan , left kidney showed good perfusion and adequate cortical radiotracer concentration followed by good drainage into dilated ureter . \n right ureter and right pelvicalyceal system ( pcs ) were visualized in the postvoid image ( indirect evidence of vur ) [ figure 2b , thin arrow ] . \n retention of radiotracer was noted in dilated pcs and dilated ureter in delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2c and d ] . \n faint visualization of radiotracer was noted through the pcn tube after removal of clamp [ figure 2b , bold arrow ] . \n a large photopenia was noted in the suprapubic region in the urinary bladder ( ub ) during dynamic [ figure 1 ] as well as delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2a  d ] . \n an usg of the abdomen was done in the radiology department of our hospital to find out the cause of this persistent photopenia in the ub . \n usg of the abdomen showed evidence of left - sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and grossly enlarged hydronephrotic right kidney with dilated right ureter and an intracystic ureterocele arising from the right side [ figure 3a and b ] . \n perfusion and dynamic images of 99mtc -

dimercapto succinic acid ( dmsa ) scan should be undertaken routinely to assess the distribution of function in the duplex kidney and for detecting and follow - up of scarred tissue and nonfunctioning upper poles in cases of ureterocele . \n did a study on pediatric ureteroceles in 19 patients , on the diagnosis , management and treatment options . \n vcug was able to detect vur in 13 out of 17 patients ( 33% ) . \n dmsa scintigraphy showed ipsilateral renal scarring and nonfunctioning upper pole images in 7 out of 13 patients . computed tomography and mag3 scintigraphy \n did a study on the management of 36 patients with varied presentation of complicated ureteroceles . \n usg , micturating cystourethrogram , isotope renogram were done preoperatively in all the babies . in one of the cases , \n initial usg was unable to detect ureterocele in most of the cases in this study . \n they said that unless the usg is done in well - hydrated , cooperative patient , ureterocele is likely to be missed on usg . \n hence , an intravenous pyelogram , radioisotope renogram , and micturating cystourethrogram are invaluable in the complete understanding of ureterocele . in our patient also , the diagnosis of ureterocele was missed on initial usg . \n photopenia was noted in the ub on our scan , and this prompted us to investigate the patient further . \n possible causes for photopenic defects in the ub on nuclear scintigraphic studies include bladder papilloma , bladder polyp , carcinoma bladder , bladder calculus , foreign body in ub , intravesical ureterocele , etc . \n repeat usg revealed the cause of photopenia in ub in our case to be an intravesical ureterocele . on reviewing the literature we found that tc -

         "the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality . \n dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation \n . however , the needs for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable . in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ] . \n inadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate . in our institution , the only sampling tool available to perform the outpatient sampling procedure is the uterine explora model i - mx120 ( http://www.coopersurgical.com/ ) ( figure 1 ) . \n in addition , the device is sterile and disposable ( one - time use ) . \n the advantages of using explora rather than d&c as a sampling device include a reduction in hospitalization costs , extra convenience for the patient and physician , and the minimal complications of the procedure . \n the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses . \n after obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) . \n two hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model \n i , the syringe provided with the instrument was used to create a negative pressure , and the explora was rotated as it was withdrawn . after withdrawal , the tip was cut off , and the tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin saline fixative and was sent for pathological examination . \n the pathologists who interpreted the endometrial samples were blinded to the instrument or method used to obtain the samples . \n an inadequate sample was defined as consisting of only blood , cervical mucus , endocervical epithelium , or blood with fragments of endometrial glands or stroma insufficient for histopathological assessment and diagnosis . \n the age , gravidity , parity , menstrual history , uterine size , hysteroscopy findings ( when available ) , and the presence or absence of any cervical abnormality were recorded on the request forms , which were reviewed by the investigators . for each of the two methods used ( explora model i and d&c ) , the numbers and percentages of inadequate samples and age group clustering were calculated and statistically analyzed . \n of the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples , \n the explora sampler was used to collect 224 samples ( 88.5% ) , whereas 29 samples ( 11.5% ) were obtained by d&c ( figure 2 ) . \n thus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 ) \n . age group clustering ( i.e. , numbers of premenopausal and postmenopausal women ) of inadequate sample results was also calculated ( figure 3 ) . of the 253 inadequate samples , \n 82.6% were from women 45 years of age and older ( i.e. , postmenopausal ) compared to 17.4% in premenopausal women ; the age difference was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . \n the detection rates of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using both methods were assessed and calculated . \n of the 73 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia , 50 ( 68.5% ) were diagnosed by d&c , and 23 ( 31.5% ) were diagnosed using the explora sampler . \n however , of the 18 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer , the rates of detection were similar between the two methods . \n endometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ] . in recent years \n , less hazardous and more inexpensive and convenient outpatient sampling methods have replaced the traditional , in - hospital , endometrial curettage . \n the advantages of outpatient endometrial biopsy include reduced cost and less risk for the patient , as no anesthesia is required . \n furthermore , the discomfort and pain produced by sampling have been reported to be minimal . \n however , it is essential to ensure that outpatient endometrial sampling is quantitatively adequate and comparably accurate to conventional dilatation and curettage . \n a sample is judged as adequate if a specific diagnosis can be given from the histological examination of the endometrial fragments obtained . \n adequacy can be measured by comparison of either outpatient biopsy with curettage histological evaluation or outpatient biopsy with the results of pathological examination of hysterectomy specimens [ 3 , 4 ] . \n many techniques for obtaining an endometrial sample without the need for curettage have been described in the literature . \n chicago , il , usa ) and the novak biopsy curette with a 10  ml syringe functioning as an aspiratory device , which have been shown to be equally effective compared to d&c in detecting an endometrial pathology [ 69 ] . \n however , the vabra aspirator and novak biopsy curette , although widely available and relatively inexpensive , have several disadvantages , including the need for an electric vacuum pump to perform the aspiration in the former technique and the pain caused by both methods . as a result of these drawbacks , smaller inexpensive and \n self - contained instruments have been developed and the prototype of this class of endometrial samplers is the pipelle . the pipelle has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of vabra aspiration and the novak curettage while causing less pain [ 911 ] . \n all of these instruments ( i.e. , the vabra aspirator , the novak biopsy curette , and the pipelle ) have low rates of false - negative and insufficient tissue results for the detection of endometrial abnormalities , as determined by comparison to hysterectomy specimens [ 1113 ] . \n it was found that pipelle biopsy had a sensitivity of 99.2% in pinpointing high grade cancer and a sensitivity of 93% in detecting low grade malignancies ; the sensitivities defined for d&c were 100% and 97% , respectively . while \n excellent agreement  was generally noted between preoperative histology and grade and the final pathology , pre - operative endometrial sampling more commonly provided underestimates of final grade ( low grade versus high grade ) than overestimates . \n the explora is somewhat similar in its design to the pipelle , but clinical studies on its effectiveness are scarce , with the effectiveness ranging between 14.6 and 15% according to various studies [ 6 , 15 ] . \n our own findings revealed that the rate of obtaining inadequate samples using the explora was much higher ( 17.6% ) than the rates reported in the literature . \n however , most of these cases ( 82.6% ) were obtained from postmenopausal women with atrophic endometrial status . \n this finding is in keeping with the rates reported by other investigators [ 58 , 16 ] . \n this retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique . \n this finding indicates that clinicians performing endometrial sampling would benefit from more experience and training using the explora technique . \n additional studies comparing the adequacy of samples obtained with different endometrial sampling techniques and devices are warranted . \n furthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma .",
         "aims . our aim is to compare the adequacy and diagnostic yield of samples obtained by the endometrial explora sampler i - mx120 with endometrial specimens obtained by conventional dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) \n . methods . a total of 1270 endometrial samples \n were received in the histopathology laboratories at the king khalid university hospital , riyadh , saudi arabia , between 2007 and 2010 . in the outpatient clinic , \n the uterine explora model i was used to obtain 996 samples . \n the remaining 274 samples were obtained by conventional d&c . \n sample adequacy and the clustering of inadequate specimens according to age groups by the two different techniques were compared and statistically analyzed . results . out of 1270 endometrial samples , 253 ( 19.9% ) were inadequate . \n the uterine explora was used in 88.5% of these inadequate samples ( 253 samples ) , and the remaining 11.5% were obtained by d&c . \n the insufficient tissue incidence was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with the d&c ( 2.2% ) and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . \n the ages of the patients , as well as the clinical indications for the procedures , were recorded . conclusion . \n this retrospective study demonstrated better specimen adequacy when d&c was used compared to the higher rate of sample insufficiency obtained with the explora .",

         "with increasing availability , widened indications , and technical refinements of computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , the number of incidentally discovered adrenal lesions , such as adrenal incidentalomas and incidental adrenal enlargement , is increasing . in a recent study by tang et al . \n , among a total of 564 eligible ct studies ( patients undergoing ct without prior known malignancy , trauma , or endocrine disease ) , adrenal hyperplasia was detected in 64 cases , giving a prevalence of 11.3% . \n this indicated that incidental adrenal enlargement had a significant prevalence and has become a common clinical problem . \n it should be emphasized that the term incidental adrenal enlargement represents the way the lesion was detected ( incidentally ) , rather than the etiology or diagnosis . \n it is a common term for a variety of adrenal disorders , but its cause must be properly assessed so that patients needing treatment , such as those with hormone hypersecretion or malignant disease , can receive appropriate care . however , there is a lack of literature on functional status and its follow - up to provide comprehensive insight to these findings . \n patients with incidental adrenal enlargement were evaluated in a tertiary referral hospital with endocrinological departments in china . \n this study aimed to determine the primary clinical presentation that most frequently leads to the discovery of adrenal enlargement , to evaluate clinical characteristics and functional status of these patients , and to analyze risk factors for functional lesions . \n this retrospective study included 578 patients with adrenal imaging features showing adrenal enlargement who were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology in pla general hospital ( beijing , china ) between january 1993 and july 2013 . \n data retrieved included patient demographics , final functional diagnosis , adrenal imaging features , and concomitant diseases . \n patients were classified as having incidental adrenal enlargement when abdominal imaging was performed for indications unrelated to adrenal disease . \n patients with diseases known to cause adrenal enlargement , such as known endocrine disorders which could affect adrenal size , trauma , and underlying malignancy , were excluded . among all enrolled patients , 78 presented with incidental adrenal enlargement . \n the ct imaging technique used was not standardized due to the various clinical indications . however , to be included in their entirety on a maximum of 5  mm section thickness , the upper limit of normal was set as 10  mm for the body of the gland and 5  mm for each limb as documented by vincent et al . . \n the type of enlargement , based on subjective evaluation of the adrenal glands , was recorded as either smooth or nodular . \n nodular enlargement was diagnosed if the adrenal gland had an irregular contour , contained nodules , and had normal adrenal tissue interspersed between the nodules . \n smooth enlargement was defined as enlargement of the gland with a smooth contour and no measureable or diffuse nodules . after obtaining patient history and physical examination , all patients underwent biochemical evaluation to assess their functional status . \n patients with elevated 24-hour urine - free cortisol level ( 2 times ) or those in whom plasma cortisol levels did not decrease after an overnight low - dose dexamethasone test ( 1  mg dst ; cutoff 50 \n patients with an aldosterone - rennin ratio ( arr ) > 20 underwent any 1 of 3 confirmatory tests ( saline infusion , captopril challenge , or postural stimulation ) to confirm or exclude definitively primary hyperaldosteronism ( pa ) . \n categorical data such as gender and clinical / radiologic features were compared using -test or fisher 's exact test . \n variables that resulted in a p < 0.05 in the univariate analyses were entered into logistic regression analysis to assess the risk factors of functional lesions . \n the hospital ethics committee approved this study , and written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents . \n of 578 patients with adrenal enlargement , 78 cases ( 13.49% ) were detected incidentally . \n every 2 years , the numbers of total cases were 17 , 11 , 14 , 24 , 33 , 31 , 54 , 55 , 114 , and 225 , respectively . \n the numbers of incidental adrenal enlargement cases were 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 4 , 16 , and 49 , respectively . \n in addition , the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement gradually increased ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 4.17% , 3.03% , 7.32% , 9.26% , 7.27% , 14.04% , and 21.33% ) . \n 39 cases had unilateral enlargement on the left side and 3 on the right side , and the remaining 36 were bilateral enlargement . \n as shown in table 1 , routine medical checkup was found to have the greatest chance ( 43.59% ) of revealing clinical onsets leading to the discovery of adrenal enlargement . \n predominant complaints included low back pain ( 10.26% ) and abdominal pain ( 3.85% ) . in addition , there were 30 ( 38.46% ) cases in which the lesions were incidentally detected during hospitalization for underlying diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and coronary heart disease , among others . biochemical and functional evaluation revealed that 54 ( 69.23% ) cases were nonfunctional and 12 ( 15.38% ) were subclinical cushing syndrome ( scs ) ; among these patients , 10 cases were diagnosed as aimah , the other 2 were diagnosed as adenomas , and they were all confirmed by pathology results . \n primary hyperaldosteronism 6 ( 7.69% ) , metastatic 1 ( 1.28% ) , the primary cancer was gastric cancer . \n there were 5 patients ( 6.41% ) whose functional status remained unclear because of failure to finish the functional evaluation ( figure 2 ) . \n nodular adrenal enlargement ( or 7.306 ; 95% ci , 1.72728.667 ; p = 0.006 ) was the risk factor for functional lesions . \n as outlined above , incidental adrenal enlargement is detected with increasing frequency , most likely due to widespread increase in cross - sectional imaging , and is gradually emerging as a common clinical problem . \n our study shows that the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement has gradually increased by year . \n mean age at diagnosis was 50.32 years , which is in line with other incidentally detected adrenal findings , namely , adrenal incidentaloma . \n the increasing age of the general population and a research trend towards more advanced investigations in the elderly population may be contributing to the high detection rate in this age group . \n our results indicate that , for the elderly patients , it is essential to place emphasis on these incidental findings . \n 's study   indicated that , of the total 64 patients , of which 40 ( 63% ) were men and 24 ( 37% ) were women , 43 ( 67% ) cases were bilateral enlargement and 21 ( 33% ) cases were unilateral . \n in addition , smooth enlargement was more common , in 53 ( 83% ) cases , and together these statistics reflect the likelihood that adrenal enlargement will be bilateral , smooth , and found in men . \n however , our study did not show this tendency , likely because the research goals and thus , study populations , differed between the 2 studies . \n 's study aimed to explore prevalence , while the present study aimed to evaluate functional status . \n in addition , patients enrolled in our study were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology . it should be noted that admitting was more or less selective , especially in tertiary referral hospitals , and that economic considerations in parts of china were still a problem . \n clinically , upon discovery of incidental adrenal enlargement , 2 issues arise : functionality and malignancy . in the relevant literature [ 48 ] , adrenal enlargement can result from endocrine disorders , such as adrenocorticotropic hormone- ( acth- ) dependent or independent cushing syndrome , pa , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men-1 ) , and congenital adrenal hyperplasia . \n other potential causes include nonfunctional lesions , defined as a radiographic adrenal enlargement without clinical or biochemical manifestations , inflammation , neoplastic processes , obesity , or depression . \n 12 patients were found to have subclinical cushing syndrome ( originated from the adrenal gland ) and 6 patients were diagnosed with pa . however , the variety of disease spectrum in the study was only moderate , perhaps due , in part , to the limited number of included cases . \n it is important to note that even though reported prevalence was up to 11.3% , patient referrals to endocrinologists are relatively rare . \n this is likely related to the poor radiological awareness of this issue and its potential clinical significance . \n the clinical significance of lesion location and patient gender is smaller . in the present study , \n acth - independent macronodular hyperplasia ( aimah ) and primary pigmented nodular adrenal hyperplasia often manifest as adrenal hyperplasia . the clinical features of aimah tended to be atypical . \n nodules usually distorted and completely obscured the normal adrenal glands and were characteristically  ginger - like  . \n as for pa , adrenal glands affected by idiopathic hyperaldosteronism ( iha ) may be normal on the ct scan or show nodular changes , and small aldosterone producing adenoma ( apas ) may be interpreted incorrectly by the radiologists as \n iha  on the basis of ct findings of bilateral nodularity or normal - appearing adrenal glands [ 1013 ] . \n thus , it is a simple matter to explain why nodular enlargement could be a predictive factor of functional lesions . \n meanwhile , this also suggests that if incidentally detected lesions were nodular enlargements , evaluating its functional status should be a priority . \n in addition , the present study suggests that lesions on the left side were likely to be nonfunctional . \n in addition , there was only one patient with malignant lesion in the present study , and thus we were unable to analyze incidence of malignancy . \n incidental adrenal enlargement is a frequent radiographic finding and it is accompanied by diverse clinical factors that require proper diagnostic evaluation and management . in functional evaluation ,",

         "septic arthritis of the shoulder is uncommon in adults . it is a surgical emergency as joint destruction occurs rapidly and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality . \n a 43 years old male came to our outpatient department with complaints of pain and stiffness of his left shoulder . on examination , his shoulder movements were severely restricted . \n further evaluation with mri revealed septic arthritis of left gleno - humeral joint for which emergency arthroscopic debridement was done . \n septic arthritis of shoulder may not present with classical clinical features . hence , a through clinical and radiological evaluation will help us prognosticate and treat accordingly thereby preventing complications like septic shock , osteomyelitis . \n patients with septic arthritis usually develop moderate to severe joint pain , warmth , tenderness , effusion , restricted active and passive motion , and sometimes redness . \n we report an unusual presentation of shoulder septic arthritis in a 43 years old man with no other clinical signs and symptoms of classical septic arthritis . \n a 43-year - old man presented to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic with 2 months history of pain and limited range of motion in his left shoulder . \n his pain was insidious in onset , mild to moderate in intensity , aggravated by activities and associated with moderate rest and night pain . \n patient was diagnosed as frozen shoulder at an outside facility and had been given intraarticular depomedrol 40 mg injection for the same 40 days ago with no improvement in his symptoms . \n he is diabetic and has liver cirrhosis and is on treatment . on physical examination , \n the skin colour and temperature of the left shoulder were normal , but the shoulder was tender to touch over the anterior joint line . \n mri was obtained [ fig 2 ] which showed extraosseous soft tissue enhancements around left shoulder with soft tissue abscess in inter muscular planes of supraspinatous , infraspinatous , subscapularis . \n blood test revealed normal white cell count with normal differential count , crp-13.4 mg / l ( normal<5.0 mg \n the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised , at 88 mm / hour ( normal range , 0 - 20 mm / hour ) aspiration of shoulder joint was performed and fluid was sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture , afb staining , mycobacterium culture , and mycobacterium genetic testing . \n arthroscopic lavage of the joint was done and articular fluid sent for repeat aerobic and anaerobic culture . \n joint visualization was markedly limited because of severe inflammation and fibrinous changes of the joint . \n the articular cartilages of glenoid and humeral head were completely eroded down to the bone . \n susceptibility of the isolate was determined with the disk diffusion method and it was susceptible only to colistin . \n 3 ) fibrocollagenous and fibrovascular inflammed connective tissue containing proliferated blood vessels and perivascular mixed inflammatory cells and lymphoplasmacytoid cells . \n based on preoperative and intraoperative culture report , a definitive diagnosis of polymicrobial septic arthritis of the shoulder was established and patient was treated with combination antimicrobial treatment . \n our patient had muted inflammatory response probably due to immunocompromised state ( cirrhosis and diabetes ) which is not uncommon . \n most often it is hematogenous seeding of shoulder joint , however it can also happen after intraarticular steroid injections . \n septic arthritis of the shoulder is more common in immunocompromised patients and intravenous drug abusers . in this case report , the patient had atypical clinical symptoms and is immunocompromised and his primary source of infection seems to be hematogenous . \n our experience with this patient highlights the importance of maintaining high index of suspicion for septic arthritis in immunocompromised patients presenting with atypical shoulder pain associated with stiffness . in the setting of suspected septic arthritis , \n our initial pre - investigation diagnosis was atypical shoulder pain and stiffness of non specific etiology in an immunocompromised patient and infection was part of the differential diagnosis not the only diagnosis . \n esenwein et al in his report highlighted the importance of early intervention to prevent chondral damage , osteomyelitis and also to prevent systemic spread . \n various authors have highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and management of septic arthritis failing which could lead to osteomyelitis and septic shock . in our patient \n , the diagnosis was delayed due to atypical presentation and over reliance on clinical findings at an outside center . \n we strongly recommend early imaging studies in immunocompromised patients presenting with shoulder pain and practitioners should avoid loosely diagnosing as shoulder pain with associated stiffness as frozen shoulders . \n klinger et al . did a retrospective study on 21 patients who underwent surgical treatment for septic arthritis of the shoulder joint between 2000 and 2007 , and he concluded that patients with symptoms for less than 2 weeks did well with arthroscopic approach and early infection can be managed arthroscopically . \n our reports show that arthroscopic washout can give good result even after 2 weeks of clinical symptoms if there is no evidence of osteomyelitis . \n septic arthritis of the shoulder is very often due to hematogenous spread and diagnosis is often clinical . \n laboratory investigations and imaging studies like mri and usg may be useful in establishing the diagnosis but confirmation is usually by joint aspiration . \n patients who are immunocompromised and have insidious onset of moderate to severe pain and which fails to respond to trial of conservative treatment should be subjected to either ultrasound or mri instead of x - ray because very often in these group of patients it is primarily a soft tissue pathology like impingement , rc tear , calcific tendinitis or rarely infections and malignancies . \n we recommend that moderate pain of more than 4 weeks duration with severe stiffness in immunocompromised patient ( liver cirrhosis , renal failure , steroid treatment ) should be further evaluated with mri or ultrasound in the setting of normal x - ray and should not be loosely diagnosed as frozen shoulder . \n goldenberg in his report emphasized the role of local as well as systemic factors that predispose patients with cirrhosis to gram - negative bacterial joint infections . \n malnick also reported a case of spontaneous septic arthritis in a cirhottic patient that was due to e.coli . \n our study as well as other studies by goldenberg and malnick highlight the importance of including broad spectrum antibiotics with gram negative cover whilst waiting for final culture sensitivity . \n septic arthritis of shoulder may not present with classic clinical features . a through clinical and radiological evaluation should be executed and treatment initiated promptly to prevent complications like septic shock and osteomyelitis . \n the case highlights the importance of establishing anatomical and pathological diagnosis using mri in patients with shoulder pain instead of loosely diagnosing them as impingement or frozen shoulder . \n the case also challenges the practice of routine shoulder depomedrol steroid injection , in the setting of secondary frozen shoulder , atleast in immunocompromised individuals . \n primary idiopathic frozen shoulder is a rare condition and secondary frozen shoulder cases are often due to underlying shoulder pathology .",

         "the study of long bones and the cells of the bone marrow is central to a myriad of research disciplines , including , but not limited to , bone biology , cancer biology , immunology , hematology , and biomechanics . \n the bone is a highly dynamic organ that together with the cartilage forms the skeleton to provide mechanical support against loading and protection of the internal organs . \n in addition , the mineral components of bone are a storage sink for the critical signaling molecules calcium and phosphorus , as well as other factors . \n finally , bones house the bone marrow and , together with metabolically active bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts , provide the stem cell niche necessary for the maintenance of hematopoietic and lymphoid cell populations . \n bone and bone marrow are affected in many disorders , often leading to bone marrow dysfunction , severe bone pain , and pathologic fracture . \n bone is a common site of metastasis in many solid tumors , most notably breast cancer and prostate cancer , where tumor cells directly engage the bone marrow niche to initiate the vicious cycle of bone metastasis and displace hematopoietic stem cells . \n hematopoietic malignancies including myeloma and leukemia are characterized by bone marrow dysfunction as well as deregulation of healthy bone remodeling . \n other non - malignant skeletal disorders are also active areas of research , such as osteoarthritis , osteoporosis , scoliosis , and rickets . even in an otherwise healthy individual , biomechanical failure in a bone \n all of these disorders represent active areas of research with the goal of identifying new preventative measures and treatment regimens to reduce morbidity and mortality . to research the plethora of roles of the bone and the bone marrow , both under physiologic and pathologic conditions \n , it is critical for researchers to have a simple and efficient standardized method for dissection of the mouse long bones for rapid processing of large in vivo experiments . \n the dissection protocol outlined here is suitable for all long bone analyses including ex vivo imaging , histology , histomorphometry , and strength testing , among others . \n similarly , a standardized bone marrow isolation method with high bone marrow cell recovery and low inter -

induced fracture or bone scoring that may influence downstream analyses . \n in addition , the centrifugation method for isolating bone marrow does not require cutting the bone to expose the bone marrow space or fluid to flush the bone marrow , reducing potential points of contamination . \n moreover , the centrifuge technique is relatively high - throughput with lower hands - on time than other methods , thus reducing processing time . \n high variation is inherent to in vivo mouse studies due to high mouse - to - mouse phenotypic variation . in order to maximize the research impact of expensive and labor - intensive mouse studies , it is critical to minimize technical experimental error . \n time from animal sacrifice to downstream analysis or tissue fixation introduces experimental variation that may overcome subtle changes and reduce large differences between groups . \n the long bone dissection and bone marrow isolation techniques described here are optimized for rapid processing of animals and samples to reduce technical variation . \n this protocol can be widely applied to many research fields , including investigation of the bone tissue itself or interrogation of the cells of the bone marrow . \n in addition , this straightforward approach to long bone dissection will enable researchers in related fields to directly interrogate bone contributions in order to expand our knowledge of bone marrow dysfunction in otherwise understudied pathologies . \n ",
         "investigation of the bone and the bone marrow is critical in many research fields including basic bone biology , immunology , hematology , cancer metastasis , biomechanics , and stem cell biology . despite the importance of the bone in healthy and pathologic states , however , it is a largely under - researched organ due to lack of specialized knowledge of bone dissection and bone marrow isolation . \n mice are a common model organism to study effects on bone and bone marrow , necessitating a standardized and efficient method for long bone dissection and bone marrow isolation for processing of large experimental cohorts . \n we describe a straightforward dissection procedure for the removal of the femur and tibia that is suitable for downstream applications , including but not limited to histomorphologic analysis and strength testing . \n in addition , we outline a rapid procedure for isolation of bone marrow from the long bones via centrifugation with limited handling time , ideal for cell sorting , primary cell culture , or dna , rna , and protein extraction . \n the protocol is streamlined for rapid processing of samples to limit experimental error , and is standardized to minimize user - to - user variability .",

         "tuberculosis ( tb ) is a major health issue in developing countries with over two billion people being infected with tuberculosis bacilli world wide ( 1 ) . although tb was recently regarded primarily as a disease of the developing countries it is now also on the increase in developed countries such as the united kingdom , mainly as a result of globalisation as well as an increase in immunosuppressed patients . \n figures by the health protection agency ( hpa ) show that the cases of tb in the uk increased by 5.5% in 2009 when compared to those in 2008 ( 2 ) . \n this caucasian patient presented to the emergency department with sudden pain localised to the ulnar aspect of her wrist . \n x - ray of the forearm was normal and she was treated conservatively but was lost to follow up . \n she presented again at the orthopaedic clinic 26 months later with continuing swelling and pain . \n ultrasound showed a synovial tumour on the dorso - medial aspect of the wrist ( figure 1 ) . \n ultrasound showing a synovial tumour on the dorsal medial aspect of the wrist however , special stains for fungi and acid fast bacilli were negative . \n subsequently the patient developed a sinus and continued to have a chronic discharge from her left wrist . \n x ray this time showed destruction of the ulnar styloid consistent with a bony infection ( figure 2 ) . \n mri showed destruction localised around the ulnar head with oedematous changes extending up the shaft of the ulna ( figure 3 ) . \n ap xray of the wrist showing destruction of the ulnar styloid consistent with a bony infection . \n soft tissue swelling can also be noted over the dorsum of the wrist mri showing localised destruction around the ulnar head . \n the mri also shows thickening around the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon in keeping with marked tenosynovitis at this site . \n the patient agreed to a repeat biopsy and excision of the necrotic bone ( figure 4 ) . \n microscopy of the specimen again showed a florid granulomatous inflammatory process with areas of fibrinoid necrosis . \n post - operative xray of the wrist showing excision of the ulnar styloid further enquiry revealed that our patient had been experiencing lethargy but no other features to suggest tuberculosis . \n following the diagnosis of tb , the patient recalled that in her former post as a nursing assistant , when she was much younger , she was exposed to patients with tb . \n although improvements in its management and treatment are continuously occurring an estimated 1.8 million people died of tb in 2008 ( 1 ) . \n extra - spinal tuberculous osteomyelitis is rare and comprises about 2 - 3% of all cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis , with the hip and knee joints being the most common following spinal involvement ( 3 ) . \n tuberculous involvement of the ulna is uncommon and tends to be more common in the diaphysis . \n a high index of suspicion of tb is important to obtain the correct diagnosis . in chronic soft tissue and bony infection \n the diagnosis of tb may not be evident from the history and examination and indeed no obvious risk factors may be present as in our case . in our patient \n the infection could have been contracted at a much younger age , when she was caring for patients infected with tuberculosis , and remained latent . \n however no other risk factors were evident that could explain why the disease was activated after such a long period of latency . \n it is also interesting to note that the actual distal radio - ulnar joint was not involved , most of the destruction being situated around the ulnar process . \n although localisation of the tuberculous infection in the bone without joint involvement can occur , this is rare ( 3 ) .",
         "tuberculosis ( tb ) is a major health issue in both developing and developed countries such as the uk . \n healthy individuals who contract the infection have only 5 - 10% chance of converting to the active disease over their lifetime . \n we present the clinical history of a 76 year old female who attended the emergency department complaining of wrist pain , and was only diagnosed with tb after three years . \n this case report emphasises the importance of including tb in the differential diagnosis when treating patients with an infection resistant to conventional antibiotics , even though risk factors for tb may not be evident or special stains for tb are negative .",

         "the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy , although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma . \n they seem to be different from those of regular antiepileptic medications ( aeds ) , and discovering what they are may lead to its use in clinical situations other than epilepsy as well . \n the kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction . \n although there is some debate about the last component , clinical practice has shown that stopping fluid restriction can lead to seizure recurrence much in the same way as when stopping glucose restriction . \n the most important result of observing the diet is the increased blood level of free fatty acids ( ffas ) . \n the ffas are transferred into the mitochondria , a process which requires the presence of an appropriate amount of carnitine , where they are degraded into ketone bodies through  oxidation . \n these ketone bodies include  hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , and acetone   ( figure 1 ) . \n the effect of the increased amount of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd . \n the degradation of the ketone bodies delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl - coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . unlike glucose , which requires a transporter to cross the blood brain barrier , \n the ketone bodies penetrate it easily . when this transporter is deficient , as in glut 1 deficiency , the kd is the preferred way of antiepileptic treatment , since it allows for bypassing the need for glucose . \n children in whom the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - coa is blocked , for instance , in pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) deficiency , will also benefit from bypassing this route . \n hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body measured in the blood , and it is used to monitor the degree of ketosis during therapy . \n the breath of a patient who is ketotic while on the diet will often even smell of acetone . \n acetone is one of the ketone bodies that have an anticonvulsant effect in several types of mouse seizure models . \n the mechanism of this effect is unknown , although an effect on k2p channels has been proposed .   by means of the tca cycle , \n acetyl - coa increases the level of the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) and the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in brain , respectively . \n another product of an elevated level of free fatty acids is polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) . \n the potential ability of pufas to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with some rather more complicated mechanisms , including ( 1 ) directly inhibiting voltage - gated sodium and calcium channels , ( 2 ) activating a lipid - sensitive potassium channel , ( 3 ) enhancing the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability , ( 4 ) activating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- ( ppar ) , and ( 5 ) inducing the expression and activity of brain - specific uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria , thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect . \n neuroprotection can contribute to the anticonvulsant effect , but it may have other effects as well , which can lead to other clinical uses of the kd . \n appleton and de vivo   reported that the kd increased the total quantity of bioenergetic substrates ( adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) ) and elevated the energy charge in rat brain . \n acetoacetate , a product of  hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenation , is transferred into acetyl - coa which enters the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle . \n the increased turnover of the tca cycle generates protons and electrons that are channeled to the electron transport chain . \n this , in turn , drives the formation of atp from adenosine phosphate ( adp ) by atp synthase . \n enhanced atp can either be converted to phosphocreatine for energy storage or broken into adenosine . \n enhanced atp levels provide energy reserves for a neuron to continue functioning under stress . increased extracellular adenosine offers a neuroprotective buffer against insults , reduces excitation , and averts excessive atp demands , thus providing local seizure control and neuroprotection . \n it was also suggested that the kd influences toward an upregulation of transcripts encoding energy metabolism enzymes and increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal process , leading to heightened energy reserves . \n an improved energetic status can support seizure prevention , for instance , by supporting gabaergic inhibition . \n it is suggested that adaptive processes to the metabolic changes induced by the diet lead to changes in gene expression which in turn result in some of the above - noted changes . \n other path of neuroprotection is modulated through decreased generation of ros which is considered to be related to pufas effect on uncoupling proteins . \n the fact that the kd is considered a proven therapy with relatively few adverse affects and wide clinical experience , particularly in children , led to recent studies investigating new potential uses for other neurological disorders . \n one of the most intriguing and active fields of research is the effect of a high - fat caloric - restricted diet on the survival of brain tumors cells . \n it is hypothesized that mitochondrial abnormalities impair the ability of brain tumors to generate energy from ketone bodies . unlike normal cells , \n malignant tumor cells have impaired genetic adaptability due to their genetic abnormalities and , therefore , increased susceptibility to environmental stress , such as fasting or caloric restriction . \n the same genomic defects that are involved in the creation of brain tumors can be exploited for their destruction [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] .   in 1995 , nebeling et al \n .   reported two young girls with unresectable advanced stage brain tumors who had poor response to radiation and chemotherapy . \n they were treated with a kd and their response was remarkable , both clinically and according to positron emission tomography follow - up scans . \n described a patient with glioblastoma multiforme whose tumor , which is very malignant , improved on the kd . surprisingly , despite the appealing efficacy of this treatment , no further human studies or clinical trials on the kd as a therapy for brain tumors have been conducted . \n several laboratory studies in mouse and rat models have recently confirmed that inhibition of brain tumor growth is directly related with reduced levels of glucose and elevated levels of ketone bodies . \n moreover , the kd was shown to reduce reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the brain . \n cancer cells need high levels of ros for the induction of angiogenesis and the production of tumor growth factors , thus , through this mechanism the kd can be protective . \n the clinical manifestations were mainly intractable seizures that necessitated repeated admissions to the intensive care unit , as well as severe cognitive and alertness decline . \n after the oncologists decided that antitumor treatment would be ineffective , she was started on the kd . \n after four weeks of trial , it did not have any effect on the tumor progression . \n however , it did have a notable improving effect on cognition , alertness , and mood of the girl , in spite of her devastating condition . \n the beneficial effect of the kd on cognition , alertness , and mood is well recognized , and clinical experience shows that in many times it is not less important than the anticonvulsant effect . \n the potential neuroprotective effect of the kd was what motivated investigations into its potential as a treatment option in other neurologic disorders . \n there are increasing numbers of reports that ketosis achieved by starvation or administration of a kd has a consistent neuroprotective effect after various brain injuries in animal models . \n one human pilot study and several animal model studies have shown improvement in autistic behavior parameters with kd treatment . \n it remains to be further clarified whether this improvement is related to reduced epileptic activity found in up to 30% of these patients or to a primary effect of the kd . \n a factor that can be crucial for the application of the kd in medical conditions other than intractable epilepsy is the inherent difficulties in its use . \n dietary restriction can pose a significant problem in a child with a progressive tumor that undergoes massive chemotherapy , who may already be cachectic . \n the kd may not be an option in a grown - up hyperactive autistic child . \n thus , the neurologist must evaluate the appropriate clinical , familial , and environmental situations very cautiously prior to the recommendation of the kd . in conclusion , \n the major metabolic effect of the kd is in supplying the brain with an increased amount of free fatty acids . \n their degradation into ketone bodies , together with the load of pufas , leads to major changes in the metabolic , bioenergetic , mitochondrial , and even genetic constellation . \n whether it may also be effective in other pathologies , especially in treating malignancies , awaits future research .",
         "although the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been widely accepted as a legitimate and successful therapy for epilepsy and other neurological disorders , its mechanism of action remains an enigma . \n the use of the kd causes major metabolic changes . \n the most significant of them seems to be the situation of chronic ketosis , but there are others as well , for instance , high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) . \n these  primary  influences lead to  secondary  , in part adaptive , effects , for instance changes in mitochondrial density and gene expression . \n clinically , the influences of the diet are considered as anticonvulsive and neuroprotective , although neuroprotection can also lead to prevention of seizures . \n potential clinical implications of these mechanisms are discussed .",

         "the endotracheal tube ( ett ) should be placed at the optimal level to avoid inadvertent complication . \n if the ett is too deep , it increases the risk of unintended single lung ventilation . \n on the other hand , if the ett is too shallow , it may cause vocal cord injury by the ett balloon or accidental extubation . \n there are many methods for determining the appropriate depth of ett in adults ; fixed insertion depth according to sex ( 23 and 21  cm from the upper incisors in adult males and females , respectively ) , the use of depth marks on the ett , suprasternal palpation of the ett tip or cuff , and bilateral auscultation . \n although chest radiography and bronchoscopy are considered an accurate method , they are not always feasible and the costs are considerable . considering the individual variation in the length of the trachea , using fixed depths or marks on the ett may result in inadequate placement of the ett . to reduce the risk of single lung ventilation or vocal cord injury , the segment between the proximal edge of the cuff and the ett tip should be placed at the mid - trachea level . if the length of the trachea can be predicted at bedside before intubation , the ett can be placed at a safe depth for each patient . \n the purpose of this study was to determine whether surface anatomical landmarks can be used to predict the mid - tracheal level in adult patients . \n neck computed tomography ( ct ) images of adults obtained between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed by a single reviewer after obtaining approval form seoul national university hospital institutional review board ( july 17 , 2015/no . \n patients with laryngeal , tracheal , or thoracic abnormalities , tracheostomy or significant tracheal deviation caused by mass lesions were excluded . \n in addition , poor ct image quality , absent sagittal ct images , ct images that did not cover the entire trachea , or ct images taken in neck hyperextension ( boidin angle > 130 on scout view ) or hyperflexion ( boidin angle < 110 on scout view ) position were also excluded . \n levels of subglottic and tracheal airway segments that include the vocal cords ( vc ) , the cricoid cartilage ( cc ) , and the carina were identified using the method described by sirisopana et al . \n the vocal cords were identified as the most cranial level of the upper airway , with a teardrop shape below the laryngeal ventricle . anatomic level of suprasternal notch ( ssn ) \n the level of manubriosternal junction ( msj ) was defined as the middle level between the manubrium and the body of the sternum where the second rib attaches to the sternum . \n the level of carina was defined as the bifurcation of right and left main bronchus and identified by the figure 8 shaped lumen . \n the external locations of the cc , ssn , and msj were defined on the skin surface . \n the distances between the external points of the cc and the ssn ( extcc -

ssn ) . compared with males , extcc - ssn more \n accurately predicts the mid - tracheal level in females . in clinical practice , physicians can use extcc - ssn to determine the depth of ett so that the segment between the proximal edge of the cuff and the ett tip lies at the mid - tracheal level . \n there are several studies that used the distance between the surface anatomical landmarks to estimate the airway length and the optimal insertion depth of endotracheal tube . \n lee et al showed that the distance between the upper incisor and the manubriosternal angle in the neck extension position correlates with the distance between the upper incisor and the carina in the neutral neck position . \n evron et al used the sum of the 2 distances from the mouth angle to the jaw angle and from the jaw angle to the sternal manubrium to determine the depth of ett \n . however , these methods are complicated than single measurement of extcc - ssn due to the difficulty in locating the sternal manubrium , more than 1 measurement , and the need for full neck extension . \n the physicians can easily apply our method with a simple measurement of the extcc - ssn to estimate the mid - tracheal level , and apply this depth during endotracheal intubation . \n however , according to previous studies in adults , flexion and extension of the neck from neutral position are associated with the inward and outward movements of the ett . \n conrardy et al showed that the orally intubated ett can move 1.5 ( range 0.52.0 ) cm toward the carina during flexion and 2.4 ( range 1.34.3 ) cm away from the carina during extension . \n kim et al showed that the ett can migrate 1.3 ( sd 0.6 ; range 0.52.5 ) cm toward the carina during flexion and 1.7 ( sd 0.8 ; range 0.43.1 ) cm during extension . \n therefore , the position of the neck should be considered when determining the optimal depth of the ett . \n first , this study was a retrospective analysis of ct images and the distances were measured in the neutral position . \n second , since the vc is used as a baseline of the depth of intubation in our method , it can be difficult to apply our method to patients with high cormack grades . \n lastly , the efficacy of this method is yet to be demonstrated in clinical practice . in conclusion , \n the mid - tracheal level , which is considered the optimal depth of ett , can be predicted by the surface distance between the cc and ssn in adults , especially in females .",

         "embryos generated through assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) are deemed surplus when , for some reason , they are not used for reproductive purposes ( svendsen and koch 2008 ; haimes and taylor 2011 ) ; instead , they are then disposed of or , where this is allowed by a country s art regulation , may be donated for a variety of research purposes . \n thus , the generation and subsequent fate of embryos that are designated surplus are determined as much by legislation as by embryo biology or technological constraints . \n for example , legislatures differ in whether cryopreservation of embryos is permitted , meaning that in some countries any ivf embryos not immediately transferred for pregnancy are surplus , while in others they may be frozen for later transfer . in some countries , the law considers surplus embryos as the primary source of material for human embryonic stem cell ( hesc ) research , while in others this use of embryos is expressly forbidden . \n although hesc research has been subjected to exhaustive ethical scrutiny , the lack of consensus on the ontological or ethical status of surplus embryos means that the uses to which they may then be put remain contested ( deckers 2007 ; guenin 2008 ; moller 2009 ) . \n even if using human embryos for stem cell research is deemed permissible , ethical issues continue to emerge as new social practices and roles develop around the act of embryo donation . \n the relative novelty of these practices and roles , complicated by the pace of change in technical possibility and regulation , mean that there is still uncertainty about how to conceptualise embryo donation , not just in terms of systematic ethics but as a sociomoral practice in everyday social life and morality ( banks , scully , and shakespeare 2006 ) . from a sociological perspective , and also to understand more generally how everyday morality deals with unprecedented ethical dilemmas , it is important to examine which conceptualisations emerge as salient and how they are stabilised and used . \n for example , one way of thinking about the donation of embryos to research is as a bodily gift relationship , one of the many established by modern biomedicine such as the donation of eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes , organs or tissues for transplantation , blood for transfusion , and other biological tissues for research . \n drawing analogies to existing practices in this way has proved helpful in other instances of bioethical novelty ( hofmann , solbakk , and holm 2006 ) . \n however , analogies can equally well be misleading , if there are morally relevant but unacknowledged differences between situations . \n the contexts in which different organs and tissues are donated vary significantly , and these differences influence the sociomoral understanding of donation in each case and make them noncomparable in ethical terms \n . reproductive tissue , for example , is generally distinguished from other types of donated tissue because eggs , sperm , and embryos have the potential to give rise to new individuals , not just to prolong the lives of existing individuals , or to be used for research . because embryos are generally considered to have a different moral status from other tissues , the use of surplus embryos in research raises moral unease about the instrumentalization of human life that is not raised in quite the same way by the donation of either ova or sperm . \n it is therefore unclear whether an embryo can meaningfully be treated as a  gift  (  donation  ) without blurring the morally relevant differences between embryos and other tissues . \n similarly ,  hesc research ,  to which the embryo may be given , is a domain of biomedical practices and not an entity . as such \n , hesc research is not a subject with which a gift relationship can be established ( unlike , for instance , an organ recipient ) . \n understanding the social and ethical meanings that are emerging for the practices associated with embryo donation calls for a detailed empirical examination of people s reasoning behind donation decisions . \n however , most empirical studies of embryo donation have not focused on people s donation rationales in depth ( with some exceptions ; for example , haimes et al . 2008 ; de lacey 2003 ) . \n the scarcity of data on donor rationales means there is a corresponding lack of information on contextual and other factors that influence donor decisions and how these can be related to the evaluations of theoretical ethics . \n the authors of this paper have been involved in a series of linked qualitative studies of practices of embryo donation , first in the united kingdom ( researcher haimes and colleagues ) , then switzerland ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz ) , and in a smaller pilot project in china ( mitzkat , rehmann - sutter , and haimes ) . \n all three studies shared an interest in understanding reasons for the donation or non - donation of embryos . while the studies in switzerland and china drew upon the original u.k . \n design , each study was conducted independently , and the details of each project , including interview design , differed in light of the varying regulatory , clinical , and cultural contexts . however , by looking across the three data sets , we hope to gain cross - cultural insights into donation and non - donation rationales and the moral understandings on which they are based . \n the three studies all used open - ended , semi - structured , one - off interviews between the researcher and people who had been in the position of deciding whether to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n interviews were designed to explore in depth not just the interviewees decision about donation but also the background to that decision , such as their ivf story , their family and other relationships , their relationship with the clinic and its staff , and so on . \n the interviews were transcribed , coded , and initially analysed to identify the reasons for donation decisions given by participants in each study , using an interpretative approach that all of us have previously found useful for identifying key themes around decision - making and implicit or explicit ethical judgements ( charmaz 2006 ; smith , flowers , and larkin 2009 ) . \n study ran for more than three years ; after some familiarisation and observation in the collaborating clinic , 44 in - depth interviews were conducted with couples who had been asked to donate their surplus fresh embryos , generated through ongoing ivf treatment , to hesc research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ) . in the united kingdom , it has been possible for some years to donate unused embryos to stem cell and other kinds of research and also to other couples . \n the swiss study was carried out shortly after a change in the law that permitted fresh or cryopreserved surplus ivf embryos , under strictly defined conditions , to be donated to stem cell research only . in this study , 17 individuals who had variously chosen to donate or not to donate were interviewed ; thus , the decision concerned the fate of cryopreserved embryos some time after the ivf treatment that had produced them ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . the chinese work involved a much smaller three - month pilot study carried out in a large art hospital . \n it was designed as a pilot to provide a comparison with the u.k . and swiss material and is , therefore , included here despite the low number of participants , but with no attempt to draw general conclusions from it . \n legislation in china does not allow the donation of embryos to other couples , but consent can be given for a surplus embryo to be used in stem cell research or for it to be discarded . \n the study included participant observation of the information and consent procedures and qualitative interviews with five ivf patients , three choosing to donate to stem cell research and two refusing ( mitzkat , haimes , and rehmann - sutter 2010 ) . \n for the purposes of this paper , the authors involved in the studies jointly compared the rationales for donation decisions given by their participants . \n we also independently reexamined interview transcripts for material relevant to the discussion of gratitude . in the rest of this paper , we first identify and compare the main reasons given by participants in these three studies for their decisions to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n we then look in more detail at the implications of our findings for one area of potential ethical concern : the possible role of gratitude in making embryo disposition decisions . in this way \n , we not only collect empirical data to help understand the emerging moral meaning of a new practice , but also give an example to show how empirical data can be used to question and then refine the conceptual basis of bioethical theory . \n participants who chose to donate their surplus embryos to research had a background premise that donation is fundamentally permissible because embryos do not have the sort of ontological or moral status that would forbid it . \n the swiss study discovered people stating this explicitly :  [ embryos ] are not , they are not yet people ; they are nt beings with souls as far as i m concerned ,  as one swiss participant said.1 but this did not mean that the surplus embryos were considered as morally equivalent to any other tissue , and participants in both the swiss and u.k . \n interviewees stopped themselves midway through sentences referring to the  left over embryos ,  which they clearly felt , on reflection , was an inappropriate phrase . \n so the embryos did not have the sort of moral status that would have made it wrong to donate them , but neither were they completely disposable . \n to some of our participants , embryos had a value ; they were a precious resource ( haimes et al . \n 2008 ) that made simply throwing them out an unjustifiable waste . as another u.k . \n [ i]t just really seemed a waste , really , not to have them used . \n it was not always clear , however , quite how interviewees were using this notion of  precious  : whether with reference to economic  bio - value  ( waldby 2000 ; waldby and mitchell 2006 ) or because they had been obtained at intense personal and emotional cost , or because they had high moral value , or possibly a combination of all these aspects \n . particularly in the swiss study , which involved cryopreserved embryos stored for some time , participants referred to embryos moral status in a nuanced way that was highly sensitive to the developmental stage of the embryo , its physical location ( whether inside or outside the body ) , and its state ( whether cryopreserved or not ) ( see scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . \n studies seemed less interested in explicitly defining  the  moral status of an abstract embryo than working out what their own particular embryos meant for them at defined points in their own story , and what this meaning then indicated it was morally permissible for them to do with that embryo . \n across all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research . \n such research was seen as a valuable endeavour by those like the swiss participant who said ,  i feel that , fundamentally , research has to go on , and i support that . \n donation of their spare embryos to research was therefore seen as a morally good act , based on a kind of ethical arithmetic in which simple disposal produced zero good from the surplus embryo , while donation had the potential to do good by supporting research . as one u.k . \n interviewee said ,  it was quite simply that  we ve been helped by the system , we should help the system back.  not because of some sort of martyrdom or heroics or anything like that , just quite simply that without such efforts things do nt progress .  in the u.k . \n study there was an added imperative to donate surplus embryos to research as there had been a lot of press coverage about the hoped - for curative outcomes of stem cell science : \n i think the research is very important , like it was in the news a while ago to say that [ the senior clinician ] was successful in stem cell research and that s what you need in order to provide medical assistance in the future , so i m all for it . \n this observation raises a separate ethical concern about the patients understanding of the information they were given about the research goals . here \n in the swiss study , the notification from the clinic storing the frozen embryos stated clearly that donation was to stem cell research , yet the majority of donors we interviewed who referred to research did so in terms that were directly relevant to infertility . \n a lot of preparatory work , research work , went on before medicine was advanced enough that it was possible for us to have children . \n [ t]his is now maybe a tiny tiny contribution , that we can give back , if we now donate a , er , fertilised egg , perhaps for further research . \n note that in the chinese pilot study none of the participants spoke in precise terms about the research involved ; however , they described it broadly as \n one chinese interviewee said she did not really know what the research was about , but trusted the doctors and hoped it would help other infertile women . in switzerland , \n the donors were former ivf patients donating cryopreserved embryos ; in china , they were current ivf patients donating either fresh or cryopreserved embryos . in neither of these studies \n were participants asked outright if they thought their donated embryo was being used in infertility research . \n however , the fact that they used phrases such as  helping others as we have been helped  ( italics added ) indicates a potential misunderstanding . \n it raises the possibility that if they had been fully aware that the research undertaken with their embryos did not concern infertility , participants might have chosen against donation . the u.k . \n participants had much clearer ideas about the research to which they were being asked to donate ; they knew that it was not for research on fertility issues . \n these participants , as in the chinese study , were current patients donating fresh embryos . \n the differences in comprehension are therefore unlikely to be due to the request context ( former vs. current patients or fresh vs. frozen embryos ) in itself . however , in the u.k . \n study participants were asked to decide whether or not to donate to a number of specific projects , for each of which the goal and methodology was explained in detail , orally and in writing . \n it is possible that this level of engagement with the detail of the research underlies the difference . \n it will be important to clarify this , and to identify best practices for maximising patient comprehension of the research goals , because if ( as our material indicates ) the type of research to which people donate is a relevant factor in their moral evaluation , then the question of whether they fully understand its nature is ethically crucial . as we have seen , some of our participants reasoned that if their embryo was not going to be used for pregnancy , then donating it to a good endeavour ( research ) would be more meaningful than simply discarding it . \n for example , one interviewee said :  if we ve created life that we , or i , do nt want any more , then maybe it s least sinful , or however you want to put it , if something meaningful happens to it . \n i feel a little bit guilty sometimes , not very much , but a little bit like  if we can at least give these embryos for a good reason , then it was nt completely in vain .  using similar wording , another said ,  if i ve already gone a bit astray , and in a sense we ve produced life , erm , then at the very least something meaningful should come out of it . \n our interpretation of their statements is that they felt they had ( inadvertently ) done something wrong in  creating life  but then not using that life as intended in pregnancy , and that donation to a good endeavour would in some way make up for this wrong . \n ( we want to be quite clear here that we are not arguing that failure to use an ivf embryo in pregnancy actually is a moral wrong , only that some of our participants said that in their case they felt so . ) \n they did not indicate that they felt their use of ivf in itself had been wrong , but articulated the sense that in ending up with surplus embryos they had done something less than ideal . \n for these swiss participants , then , their donation decision appears to have been driven in part by what we could call a reparative urge . \n no indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below . \n across all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research . \n such research was seen as a valuable

indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below . \n approximately half of the swiss participants who were interviewed turned out to have decided against donation and instead have their surplus cryopreserved embryo(s ) destroyed . \n none of these explicitly used the moral status of the embryo as the fundamental basis for rejecting donation to research . \n the scientists  would do with their embryo , which was articulated either as disapproval of specific types of research ( e.g. ,  not if it s for cloning  ) or as a more general unwillingness to relinquish responsibility of the embryo to unknown others . in both sets of reasoning , therefore , participants were expressing unease about the loss of control over what would happen to their embryo . \n the two chinese interviewees who had opted against donation also did so because of reservations about lack of knowledge of exactly what the embryos would be used for , explicitly mentioning the fear that they would be donated to ( i.e. , used to generate pregnancy in ) other women . \n in addition , two of the swiss participants gave financial reasons , that is , they expressed anger that they would not be compensated for giving up their embryo and that through donation researchers were  getting something for nothing . \n study , speculation about why some people might refuse to donate raised concerns about what might be done with the embryos and whether a baby would be developed through experimentation ; others wondered if  refusers  were worried that another infertile couple would receive their embryos and have a baby when they , the embryo providers , failed to do so . \n sample contained only two actual refusers , who objected on the grounds of possible use in animal research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ; hug 2008 ) . \n these observations provide material for an empirically grounded bioethics of the ivf  stem cell interface ( franklin 2006 ) . in the rest of this paper , we consider a single aspect in detail : the potential  problem  of gratitude influencing informed consent . \n empirically , the main reasons given by our participants for donation were : ( 1 ) to avoid the waste of a precious resource , ( 2 ) to give something back to research , and ( 3 ) to compensate for a perceived moral wrong . in none of the three countries \n did our participants indicate that their decision arose out of any sense of gratitude to the physician who had given them ivf treatment . \n this is an important observation , because the possible impact of gratitude on informed consent in embryo donation has previously been raised by bioethical commentators . \n it has been suggested that if there is any institutional or procedural link between ivf treatment and hesc research , the potential donors gratitude toward the clinicians who have helped them to conceive may steer them toward opting for donation ( haimes and luce 2006 ; parry 2006 ; mcleod and baylis 2007 ; also discussed in roberts and throsby 2008 ) . \n the bioethical concern is that parents who receive the  gift of a baby  will feel a sense of gratitude ; feeling grateful might then cause parents to feel that they should respond with a gift in return ; and if a request for donation of surplus embryos is made in that context , potential donors might inadvertently be encouraged to see donation as an appropriate form of return gift . in this way \n the moral emotion of gratitude could compromise the potential donor s freedom to weigh the pros and cons of the request , which in turn means compromising the capacity to give fully voluntary consent . \n even where the clinicians and researchers themselves are scrupulous about not using persuasion , gratitude might be persuading potential donors to do something they would not otherwise choose to do . to avoid this possibility , countries that allow embryo donation for research may attempt a strict separation of ivf treatment and the stem cell research domain . \n ( not all legislatures do this , however : china is one country that does not . ) in the united kingdom , for example , it is accepted good practice that requests for donation of spare embryos should not be made by the physician(s ) who delivered the original ivf treatment . in switzerland , \n a predominant interpretation of the current law on embryo donation is that a couple undergoing ivf treatment should not be told even of the theoretical possibility that a surplus embryo might be generated unless it actually is ( porz et al . \n regulators hope to rule out any conflict of interest on the part of the treating physician as well as the possibility of gratitude on the part of the patient . \n there are several theoretical questions that can be asked about a claim that the  risk  of gratitude affects potential donors decisions . \n for example , moral psychologists might want to examine the emotional exceptionalism in which gratitude is seen as potentially compromising , while other emotions , or even the absence of emotion , is not . \n there is also an obvious empirical question which does not seem to have been closely examined : whether potential embryo donors actually do experience a sense of personal gratitude to the physician  or one strong enough to sway their donation decision . \n however , they do indicate that participants rationales for donation indicate a desire to  give back  in a more complex way . \n first , our empirical results show the importance of distinguishing between the three moral emotions of gratitude , indebtedness , and solidarity . \n what we normally mean by gratitude is an emotion primarily associated with gifts or with help that is undeserved . \n gratitude has been defined as  a feeling of thankful appreciation for favours received  ( guralnik 1971 , 327 ) and is experienced as a positive emotion . \n ( 2006 ) provide a basis from experimental psychology for distinguishing between indebtedness and gratitude . \n one important distinction is that  indebtedness is an emotion of exchange , whereas gratitude is not  ( watkins et al . \n even if a debt of gratitude is felt ,  it does not appear to be analogous to an economic debt \n indebtedness , however , is , literally , a debt : a  state of obligation to repay another  ( mauss 2001 , 2 ) . \n a further feature associated with indebtedness but not with gratitude is the inherent imbalance of power , so that a hierarchy is created in which those who are indebted are rendered more vulnerable . the empirical social psychological work of watkins et al . \n indicates that , in experimental settings at least , a person s feelings of gratitude diminish as the expectation of return ( indebtedness ) increases . the more reciprocity is expected or demanded , \n importantly for considering the effects of these social emotions on donation decisions , watkins et al . found that the greater the expectation that something will be given back in return , the less motivated the participants were actually to comply with the norm of reciprocity ( watkins et al . \n these results suggest that if patients were to sense any expectation of return by an individual physician or researcher , it would if anything lessen any gratitude they might have felt . in the ivf context , what people have received ( the thing for which they might feel grateful ) is their baby or pregnancy , or at the very least , treatment . donors who achieve this have not received a gift , but a medical service , which will have been paid for in one way or another . in switzerland , where ivf is not covered by the mandatory health insurance \n , this will often be direct payment from the patients to the clinic , as it will also often be in china . in the united kingdom , \n patients who do not already have children commonly receive two  free  cycles of nhs treatment ( paid for through taxes on the population ) , and then they pay for future cycles directly through fees to the clinics . whatever the system of payment , however , the point is that the ivf physician or clinic has already been paid , directly or indirectly , for the treatment which produced the outcome . \n so in the case of embryo donation , it could be argued that neither gratitude nor indebtedness should be anticipated . \n gratitude would not be expected , because what patients have received was not a favour or unexpected gift ; and indebtedness would not be expected , because there is no debt if payment has already been made . in our three studies , although we found appreciation and high esteem were expressed for the work of the treating hospital or team , we found no evidence of gratitude being expressed toward an individual physician . \n this is despite the fact that in both the united kingdom and china mention was made of the well - known head physicians who led each clinic ; the mentions were in appreciation of their reputations , not as a debt of gratitude . \n participants wanted to do something with the surplus embryo that would be of benefit to research and medical treatment for infertility , but this was not directly associated with the physician who provided it originally . indeed , some of our interviewees were critical of aspects of their own ivf treatment , while still wanting to support the infertility research enterprise overall . in this context , it should be remembered that about half the swiss participants interviewed in fact chose not to donate , primarily out of anxiety about losing control over the fate of their embryos , but also in some cases because it meant researchers were  getting something for nothing . \n study , a few patients were suspicious that research was being prioritised over treatment and that embryos might have been kept back for the research rather than frozen . \n although only a small number of participants expressed this view , it has particular relevance here as it indicates clearly the absence of either gratitude or indebtedness : indeed , it suggests that these participants felt that , if anything , donation would mean the researchers were receiving something beyond their entitlement or were indebted to the patients rather than the reverse . \n social exchanges may entail giving back not to an individual , because the individual may be unknowable or because the benefit may not have come from a single identifiable person , but to  the pattern of social life \n ( becker 1986)for example , giving back to the institutional biomedical research that had helped the participants . in serial reciprocity , person a receives something from person b , but pays back not to person b but to some other third party ( moody 2008 ) . serial reciprocity accounts for the way that altruistic blood donors often do describe their action in terms of reciprocity , even though they have not received anything from the person to whom their blood eventually goes . \n what drives serial reciprocity is not gratitude or indebtedness to an individual or an organisation but a sense of solidarity with unknown others in the community . in the case of embryo donation , what appears to be a directly reciprocal act of gratitude  a surplus embryo in return for treatment  may thus be understood as something quite different . \n participants in our studies used a rationale for donation based not on reciprocal exchange between individuals , but on  giving back to  a research enterprise from which they had benefited and which they hoped would benefit unknown others in the future . for the swiss and chinese donors who choose to donate because they think they are supporting infertility research , these unknown others are not completely anonymous : they are  known  because of imaginatively shared experience .  giving something back  to the research that had helped them ( as they think they are doing ) \n was not considered an obligation but , rather , a form of return that was meaningful and seemed especially fitting to them because of the experiences they had gone through . in the u.k . \n study , although there was greater clarity about the purpose of the research being contributed to , there was still a sense among embryo providers that they were benefiting from the fact that others had participated in research in the past which had improved ivf ; they were clear in expressing solidarity with this imagined community of previous ivf research contributors by making their own contributions to research , albeit research in another domain . \n at least some of our participants , then , also see their donation to research as an indirect way of passing on the benefit they have received from research to someone else , whose situation in some way resembles their own . \n the social meaning of this indirect reciprocity is neither gratitude nor indebtedness , but solidarity with other present and future patients . \n to summarise : our interpretation of the material suggests that donors reasons for donating were not connected in any straightforward way to either gratitude or indebtedness . for some people \n the desire not to waste a valuable ( in more than one sense ) resource is foremost . \n a generally positive stance toward biomedical science means that donation is a good use of a valuable resource . with some of the swiss participants \n , we also identified a reparative urge coming from a sense of moral unease , and here donation seems to offer a route through which the urge to make reparation can be satisfied . \n all of this suggests that neither gratitude nor indebtedness per se are present in decision - making at the ivf  stem cell interface , at least not in terms of undue inducement or of compromising the capacity for informed consent . \n the reparative urge foregrounds a different set of ethical questions about the sociomoral meaning of the generation of spare embryos and the act of donation . \n for example , the perceived need for reparation that appears to drive some of the swiss participants donation choices arises because people felt some sense of wrongdoing at creating embryos that are not used for pregnancy . \n the spirit of the swiss legal framework strongly reinforces the sense that the occurrence of embryos not used for pregnancy is to be considered as wrong . from this point of view \n , one possible conclusion could be that the felt desire for reparation is in fact an ethically appropriate response : if the act of deliberately creating an embryo is a morally significant one , which needs to be justified by the good of its intended outcome ( pregnancy ) , then not using it for the purpose that justifies it does indeed present a genuine ethical difficulty . \n on the other hand , the novelty of surplus embryos in the swiss legal and social context ( scully and rehmann - sutter 2006 ) meant that many patients would have been unaware at the time of their ivf of the possibility of generating a surplus embryo . \n moreover , in most cases there were perfectly valid clinical or legal reasons why the embryos could not be transferred , which fully justified the failure to use them as originally intended . that these factors were not in the participants control \n the swiss participants were quite aware of the valid reasons why their embryos could not be transferred , and yet some of them still said that they had fallen short of some moral standard . \n we suggest that this persistent unease ( which does not appear so prevalent in the u.k . \n these are captured in swiss legislation s highly defensive attitude toward embryos in general and the generation of surplus embryos in particular . \n swiss law operates from the presumption that a surplus embryo is an exceptional event that will happen only through the failure of regulation and practice specifically set up to prevent it ( porz et al . \n in addition , as we discussed earlier , the generation of surplus embryos is still an unfamiliar social practice and the role of the embryo donor is one that lacks widespread cultural recognition . in the swiss context of legal exceptionalism , then , producing one of these culturally unfamiliar entities may more readily be understood as something \n wrong  for which reparation is in order . in the more permissive cultural and legislative context of the united kingdom , although some interviewees expressed guilt about other aspects of the process ( for example , inappropriate styles of speech about embryos ) , there was no sense that not using the embryos as intended in itself constituted a moral failing . \n if our interpretation is correct , as the creation of surplus embryos becomes normalised in swiss society and the role of embryo donor becomes normalised in both the u.k . and \n swiss ( and other ) societies , there will be a shift in ideas about the moral meaning of surplus embryos , and this should be empirically testable . for the majority of the participants in switzerland and the united kingdom who chose to donate their surplus embryos , donation decisions were not driven by a reparative urge but by the feeling that donation expressed solidarity with research and/or other patients . \n what our empirical work shows is that gratitude to an individual must be distinguished from a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research . \n however , this does not necessarily mean that solidarity - based reciprocity has no relevant impact on the capacity for voluntary consent . \n one possible consequence , for example , is that if potential donors feel solidarity with the research enterprise , or with present and future patients , then they might also experience an obligation to support it . \n however , in all three studies there were people who chose not to donate ( about half of the swiss interviewees did not donate , while in the united kingdom approximately 46 percent of those asked have been shown to opt against donation [ choudhary et al . \n 2004 ] ) , which suggests either that there is no sense of obligation , or that it is neither universal nor irresistible . \n there is a second problem if solidarity - based reciprocity is taken as something to be prevented . \n if there is a risk that gratitude felt by an individual could influence donation decisions , then the risk can be minimised by separating ivf and stem cell research physically and procedurally , as bioethicists have suggested and some clinics and guidelines have implemented . \n but if instead there is a desire to benefit research or to show solidarity with collective  others  rather than an individual , then what sort of physical or procedural barriers could be set up to prevent it having an influence \n ? there are further theoretical questions to be explored here about the assumption that contextual emotions such as gratitude or solidarity compromise the decision to donate . \n the situation in which donation of a surplus embryo is a possibility comes about as a result of a variety of social , cultural , political , legal , and emotional features that combine to make the situation what it is . \n it will be important to identify carefully the features that are constitutive of the situation of having a surplus embryo ( including a sense of solidarity to similar others , emotional bonds with the embryo that change over time , regret over the failure to use all embryos for pregnancy , and so on ) and to consider whether these constitutive features can or should also be treated as factors that compromise the responsible , autonomous decision - making capacity of the people involved . \n this introduces the question of the extent to which any decision to donate can be detached from its context and the contextual factors that shape how people respond to donation requests . \n finally , we should not forget that the possibility that some donors misunderstand the kind of research they are donating to raises some ethical difficulty . \n it means that donors may be deciding for donation out of a misplaced sense of solidarity  a different ethical problem . \n the deliberative processes of the donor participants in our three studies incorporated their appreciation of the particular moral value of their own embryos and of the value of biomedical research . \n these deliberations are complex , and the participants own dependency on pre - existing medical research and their affiliation with others in similar situations must be recognised , we suggest , in order to understand how they might configure donation as a means to cope with the moral ambivalence of the situation in which they find themselves . \n their decisions are not driven by some unacknowledged sense of debt , but rather are responsive to the emerging social and moral reality of embryo donation in the first decade of the 21st century .",
         "this paper is based on linked qualitative studies of the donation of human embryos to stem cell research carried out in the united kingdom , switzerland , and china . \n all three studies used semi - structured interview protocols to allow an in - depth examination of donors and non - donors rationales for their donation decisions , with the aim of gaining information on contextual and other factors that play a role in donor decisions and identifying how these relate to factors that are more usually included in evaluations made by theoretical ethics . \n our findings have implications for one factor that has previously been suggested as being of ethical concern : the role of gratitude . \n our empirical work shows no evidence that interpersonal gratitude is an important factor , but it does support the existence of a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research . \n thus , we use empirical data to expand and refine the conceptual basis of bioethically theorizing the ivf  stem cell interface .",

guided neurosurgery ( igns ) devices allow the use of coregistered and fused multimodality 3d images to guide the surgeon 's hand and help define preoperatively the boundaries of pathological and predefined functional structures . meanwhile \n , new modes of medical imaging have also improved the localization of pathological lesions and their characterization . \n medical imaging nowadays includes a wealth of different techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( smri and fmri ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) . \n although the overall accuracy of igns is estimated to be 12  mm , current neuronavigation systems can not , however , adapt to changing conditions over time . \n skull - opening brain shift , brain retraction , cerebrospinal fluid suction , lesion resection , perfusion , and pharmacological manipulation during surgery indeed all alter the 3d morphology of the structures [ 25 ] . \n these changes can lead to localization errors that are one order of magnitude larger that igns accuracy [ 1 , 2 , 6 ] and may result in incomplete resections or unexpected damage to normal brain . \n such inaccuracies could be reduced if one could acquire , throughout surgery , fresh images of the same modalities and quality as the preoperative ones \n intraoperative images such as intraoperative mr ( imr ) images are  with the exception of a handful surgical facilities  usually acquired using low - field mri scanners that provide lower resolution and contrast than their preoperative counterparts , and , to this date , several useful imaging modalities , such as pet and possibly meg , can not be acquired intraoperatively . \n one solution is to  bring over  the high - quality preoperative multimodality images into the intraoperative configuration of the brain using a nonrigid registration technique [ 710 ] . \n one category of nonrigid registration techniques uses physics - based models , where landmarks are tracked in successive reduced - quality intraoperative images , and their displacement fields drive the deformation of a biomechanical model . \n so far , most of the mechanical conditions of the brain can not be estimated in the operating room , such as the volume of cerebrospinal fluid flowing out of the skull cavity , intercellular fluid volume changes that result from mannitol injection , or changes in blood volume and vessel permeability . \n the fact that an intraoperative image can provide the knowledge of the current state of the brain after some deformation partly eliminates the need for a complete evaluation of these mechanical conditions . \n the nonrigid registration technique replaces them with the landmark displacements evaluated from successive intraoperative images . using a nonrigid registration technique based on a biomechanical model , three types of brain deformations \n have been identified that require specific modeling , although they depend on common parameters , such as csf suction , perfusion , or pharmacological manipulation . \n the first deformation is the brain shift , which appears at the beginning of surgery with the opening of the skull and dura . \n the suction or leakage of csf , as well as the release of intracranial pressure caused by tumor growth , generally cause such shift of the brain ( note that in this work , we name  brain shift  the specific shift of the brain that occurs after the opening of the skull and dura , before any other surgical act has happened ) . \n however , for these deformations , we will consider that the shift is a part of these two deformations . \n the second deformation is the retraction ; when target tissues are located deep inside the brain , the surgeon incises brain tissues and inserts a retractor to spread out the tissues , and to create a path towards the target . \n the third deformation is the resection , that is , the removal , of lesion tissues . \n three deformations can thus be defined in terms of the two elemental actions that change the topology of the brain : the introduction of a discontinuity and the removal of some tissues . \n most studies of brain deformation based on biomechanical models have focused on shifts ( the topology of the brain is not modified ) , that occurs just after the opening of the skull and dura [ 1125 ] . \n a good review of these different studies can be found in [ 24 , 2628 ] . \n resection and retraction are more complex to model than ( brain ) shift . until recently , \n their modeling for the specific application of preoperative image update has received much less attention . \n one of the difficulty for modeling resection and retraction is that both induce a topological change of the brain because some tissue are cut . \n a method of mesh adaptation [ 2931 ] or remeshing [ 3235 ] must be used in conjunction with fem if an accurate representation of the location of the cut , for example , the resection cavity or retraction path , is needed to deform the model . indeed , fem can not directly handle discontinuities that go through the fes , and requires to realign the discontinuity with fe boundaries . in the field of fracture mechanics , which studies the growth and propagation of cracks in mechanical parts \n , some methods were developed to avoid using fem in conjunction with mesh adaptation or remeshing . \n the extended finite element method ( xfem or x - fem ) appeared in 1999   and has been the object of considerable research since then . \n xfem works by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within some fes of the mesh . \n the mesh does not have to conform to the discontinuities , so that these can be arbitrarily located with respect to the underlying fe mesh . because xfem allows an accurate representation of the discontinuities \n while avoiding mesh adaption or remeshing , and because of the similarity between cracks in mechanical parts and cuts in tissue , we proposed the use of xfem for handling cut , resection , and retraction in the updating of preoperative images . \n this paper presents a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal preoperative images with respect to surgical brain deformations , due to brain shift and successive resections , followed and quantified using imr images . \n our approach is modular , and is applied iteratively each time a new intraoperative image is acquired . \n we take into account successive deformations based on a linear elastic biomechanical model which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the pair of imr images under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection . \n while some 3d results have already been presented for brain shift , and initial 3d results for resection   modelings , this paper is the first complete and detailed account of the generalization to 3d of our 2d previous work . \n we present the state - of - the - art of resection modeling for preoperative image update . in section 3 \n , we describe our basic strategy for updating preoperative images based on successive intraoperative images . in section 4 , we give detail about our methods and algorithms . in section 5 , \n we consider two patient cases that illustrate our approach for handling brain shift followed by successive resections . \n among studies that take into account resection for preoperative image update , one should distinguish two categories . \n the first category of studies models brain deformation using two time - point images , the first image being acquired before surgery has started , the second image being acquired after resection . in this category , \n the methods that existed for a second image showing some brain shift are adapted for a second image showing some resection . \n the second category of studies models brain deformation using more than two time - point images , and models at least two successive resections . among the first category of studies , \n hagemann et al .   developed a 2d method for modeling brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and a postoperative mr image , the postoperative image showing a complete resection . \n the 2d mesh of the biomechanical model corresponded to the underlying pixel grid of the 2d image . \n the biomechanical model included four different linear elastic laws for the skull / skin region , the whole - brain region , the csf region , and the image background . \n they computed the correspondence of the skull boundary , the whole - brain region boundary in the neighborhood of the tumor , and the posterior midline between the two images . \n they also computed the correspondence between the internal tumor region boundary visible in the preoperative image , and the resection cavity boundary visible in the postoperative image , both boundaries corresponding under the assumption that the resection is complete . \n the displacements fields of these landmarks drove the deformation of the biomechanical model . as a result , the biomechanical model presented high deformation in the tumor region , which is not physically plausible . \n however , the resection was complete , and , thus , they were not interested by the displacement field of the biomechanical model in the tumor region itself . \n clatz et al .   developed a 3d method for modeling the brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and an imr image , the latter showing partial or complete resection . \n the biomechanical model was deformed based on a sparse volume displacement field evaluated from the two images , using a block matching algorithm . in their algorithm , blocks of voxels that presented discriminant structures were selected in the preoperative image . \n the blocks were then matched to blocks in the imr image using a similarity criterion , for example , a coefficient of correlation . \n the value of the similarity criterion was used as a value of confidence in the displacement measured by the block matching algorithm . \n the biomechanical model was then deformed iteratively , driven by the sparse displacement field of the matched blocks , where a block rejection step was included for measured block displacements initially selected but considered as outliers . in the imr image , a part , or the totality , of the tumor tissues \n the blocks were thus selected and matched in only the healthy - brain region of the two images . \n they tested their algorithm on six patient cases , and used for validation nine landmarks picked up manually in each image . \n they found a mean and maximum error on displacements of 0.75  mm and 2.5  mm , respectively . \n they explained this phenomenon by the fact that a substantial number of block matchings were rejected in the tumor neighborhood . \n the deformation of the biomechanical model in the tumor neighborhood was thus essentially governed by the linear elastic law , and the result might show the limitation of this model . \n archip et al .   also tested the nonrigid registration method presented in   on eleven patient cases , and used the 95% hausdorff distance   for evaluating the alignment of the nonrigidly registered images . as a result \n , they obtained a mean error of 1.82  mm . among the second category of studies , miga et al . \n they built a linear poroelastic biomechanical model and preoperatively tagged the tetrahedron fes that were going to be removed to simulate the brain deformation due to successive resections . \n second , a boundary condition was applied to the new boundary of the resection cavity , in order to model the relaxation of strain energy , induced by preoperative tumor growth or surgery acts , stored in the resected tissues , and released after their removal . in this approach , \n the tissue discontinuity was represented as best as possible with a jagged topology defined by the fe facets defining the boundary of the resection cavity . \n [ 45 , 46 ] also modeled the removal of tetrahedra in order to model the action of an ultrasonic aspirator in the context of real - time surgery simulation . \n [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] modeled successive resections based on several time - point imr images . between two successive images \n , they deformed the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , to take into account the ( partial ) resections(s ) that took place between these two images . \n first , the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , was deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain boundary between the pair of images under consideration . \n second , the fes that fell into the resection cavity in the second image of the pair were removed , while the fes that laid across the resection - cavity boundary were cut . to ensure the link between the successive deformed configuration of the biomechanical model , their algorithm kept track of the topology modification between fes and nodes of the mesh before and after the removal of fes . \n they tested their algorithm on one patient case including five imr images ( the first two imr images being used for brain shift modeling ) , and used for validation thirty - two landmarks picked up manually in each image . \n they found a mean and maximum error on the displacements of 0.9  0.7  mm ( mean  standard deviation ) and 3.7  mm , respectively . \n they explained this phenomenon by the limited accuracy in the process of picking landmarks in that region , and because the retraction occurring between the second and third images was modeled as a resection , that is , a removal of tissues , even though the tissues were not removed but simply spread out . \n the methods described above have been all developed using an fem - based biomechanical model for intraoperative image registration . \n the objective of a surgical simulator is to provide an interactive manipulation with force feedback of the anatomical part to be operated using various surgical instruments . in order to model a large range surgical procedures , \n jebkov and kuhlen   have applied nonlinear xfem for simulating cut , and have shown that xfem is successfully efficient for such purpose . \n the block diagram of figure 1 shows our global approach for updating preoperative images using successive imr images acquired at different critical points during surgery . \n although the principles of the approach are quite general , they are tailored for use based on images acquired with a 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner , which guarantees that the full volume of brain tissues is included in the image field of view . in our present strategy , \n the preoperative images are updated incrementally . at the end of each update , the preoperative images should be in the best possible alignment with the last imr image acquired . \n prior to surgery , a patient - specific biomechanical model is built from the set of preoperative images . because the patient does not necessarily lie in the same position during the acquisition of each of the preoperative images \n , one may need to perform a rigid registration ( involving translations , rotations , and scales ) to bring these images into correspondence , assuming , in first approximation , there is no local , that is , nonuniform , brain deformation between preoperative images . \n once the 1st imr image has been acquired prior to the opening of the skull , the set of registered preoperative images and the biomechanical model are registered to the 1st imr image via a rigid transformation . in the present situation , it is assumed that the patient 's brain imaged in the 1st imr image has the same physical shape as the brain imaged in the preoperative images ( note that in the following , when an imr image is defined by a number , this number is the index of the imr image in the series for a specific patient case . \n the 1st imr image thus corresponds to the very first imr image of the series ) . as each imr image \n is acquired , this new image and the preceding imr image are used to estimate the deformation of the brain . \n the update of the preoperative images is done incrementally with each new pair of successive imr images . for each pair , we proceed as follows . a set of common anatomical landmarks \n the use of surface structures rather than volume structures   seems more appropriate given the reduced - quality of typical intraoperative images , and would be more easily adapted to intraoperative modalities other than imr , such as ius . \n the landmark surface displacement fields resulting from the matching are then applied to the biomechanical model , which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the acquisition times of the imr images in the pair under consideration , namely , brain shift , or resection . \n the resulting displacement field of the biomechanical model is finally used to warp the set of preoperative images in their current state of updating . \n note that , for each deformation modeling , the biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the landmark displacements tracked between the pair of successive imr images under consideration . because intraoperative deformation can follow a reverse direction , it is important to track the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images , rather than track the landmarks between the first and the last acquired imr images . for the patient cases treated in section 5 , we assume that the brain undergoes relatively small deformations ( small strains and small displacements ) , and we use a linear finite - element formulation in the biomechanical model . \n a consequence of using this linear formulation ( linear elasticity ) is that the equations of solid mechanics can be solved based on the initial configuration of the solid . \n actually , knowing the displacement field increment un = u  u at the anatomical landmarks between configuration n and increment n + 1 , one can apply this constrained displacement field increment un to the initial configuration , and the finite element analysis will lead to the deformation tensor increment n between the configuration n and n + 1 . \n the final deformation tensor or the body is thus simply obtained from  = k=0k . \n remark that rigorously , the increment of constrained displacement field at the landmark should be applied to the balanced solution of the solid reached after increment n , but as we are using a linear elasticity model , this step can be skipped owing to the superposition principle : if  = c , then  = k=0k = ck=0k = c , where c is the hooke tensor . as a summary , with this approach , \n the process of deformations is modeled as a succession of deformations k , for example , brain deformation composed of shift followed by successive resections and the current configuration of the brain biomechanical model , after a specific deformation can then be recovered by adding the computed volume displacements for all successive incremental deformations . remark \n that this is not a limitation of the method as we could easily extend it to nonlinear model by simply keeping in memory the previous deformed configuration n and adding the constrained displacement field increment un to compute the new deformed configuration at increment n + 1 , simply this would be less computationally efficient . because we use a linear formulation ( and , thus , the incremental volume displacement fields can be added to recover the current configuration of the biomechanical model ) , we could theoretically obtain an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model using the two following approaches . \n the first one would consist of computing and adding the successive incremental deformations of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images . \n the second approach would consist in computing directly the deformed configuration of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the first and the last acquired imr images . \n however , the landmarks selected to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model vary depending on the type of deformation , namely , brain shift or resection . \n in addition , part of the biomechanical model is  cut ,  using xfem , to model resection . \n consequently , we would not get an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model by these two approaches . \n in order to use a maximum of information from the imr images , we track , as explained for the first approach , the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images . \n the problem of updating preoperative images between more than two critical points during surgery , that is , based on more than two imr images , is addressed in only a small number of studies . in our previous work [ 39 , 41 ] , and in \n , the biomechanical model was successively deformed , and this was done using a linear formulation . \n the framework proposed here , where the initial biomechanical model is always used , instead of using it in its successive states of deformation , has the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively deteriorates with each successive deformation modeling , and which would require remeshing or mesh adaptation for getting back good fe quality . to summarize , \n for each deformation , the landmarks are tracked between the two successive imr images under consideration . because we use a linear formulation , \n the displacement fields of these landmarks are applied to the initial , rather than current , configuration of the biomechanical model . \n the resulting volume displacement field corresponds to the deformation that the brain undergoes between the two imr images . \n this volume displacement field is used to deform the preoperative images in their current state of update , that is , registered ( at the previous step , if any ) to the first imr image of the pair . \n after the deformation , the preoperative images are thus in as good as possible registration to the second imr image of the pair . in all the rest of this work , \n we make a simplification of the approach just presented , by using the 1st imr image as a substitute for the preoperative images . \n the biomechanical model is thus built based on structures visible in the 1st imr image , instead of in the preoperative images , and the structures used in the model are limited to the ones visible in the intraoperative image . except for the rigid registration between the preoperative images , the biomechanical model , and the 1st imr image , this simplified approach allows us to discuss , illustrate , and test all key aspects of the system . \n the above strategy allows us to focus on the main issue of this paper , that is , the estimation and handling of 3d deformations . \n even though the issues involved in the update of preoperative images will need to be addressed in a operational image update system , the present strategy of deforming the imr images remains useful for calibration purpose , even in the operating room . \n this section details the different methods that are commonly used for updating preoperative images in presence of brain shift and resection . \n more specifically , the block diagram of figure 2(a ) shows the building of the biomechanical model from the preoperative images . \n specific regions from the preoperative images are segmented , meshed , and assigned appropriate constitutive laws . \n the block diagram of figure 2(b ) shows , for any pair of successive imr images , a detailed view of the calculation of the volume displacement field of the initial biomechanical model that corresponds to the deformation that has occurred between the acquisition time of these images . all along surgery , the patient is lying inside the 0.5 tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner . \n although the patient 's head is fixed , one can not totally rule out the possibility of slight head motion . \n imr images thus have to be rigidly coregistered to take into account this potential rigid motion . \n the rigid registration that we use is the point - based landmark transform available in vtk ( http://www.vtk.org/ ) . \n the segmentation of imr images into specific regions , for example , healthy - brain and tumor regions , is first performed manually using 3d slicer ( http://www.slicer.org/ ) and then smoothed to minimize the dependance of the results on segmentation roughness . \n it is clear that performing a manual segmentation in the operating room is not acceptable , and that this process needs to be automated as completely as possible to test the feasibility of our framework online . \n however , while there exist sophisticated segmentation algorithms that could be used [ 5052 ] , in particular for extracting the whole - brain region ( skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out ) , the segmentation of the tumor region is still challenging . as mentioned above , the biomechanical model is built , in the present context , from the 1st imr image rather than from the preoperative images . thanks to the use of xfem instead of fem for modeling discontinuities , this biomechanical model can be built offline before the operation starts and does not need to be repeated ( through remeshing ) during the surgery . with respect to fem - based approaches , \n the execution time thus ceases to be a limiting parameter , which is a remarkable advantage of our approach . \n it thus requires specific techniques , and we use the meshing software tool isosurf ( http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~gmt11/software/isosurf/isosurf.html ) . our goal is to model the boundaries of healthy - brain and tumor regions as two connected surfaces meshes . \n however , isosurf can only mesh the boundaries of one or several separate regions , and , thus , does not allow one to mesh connected region boundaries with common nodes at their intersections . \n we thus start by building two separate surfaces meshes that we connect using our own routines based on vtk . \n the two connected triangle surfaces are then jointly meshed into a single volume mesh of tetrahedra that conform to the two surface meshes using gmsh ( http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/ ) . \n further details on the building of the biomechanical model , in particular the building of the connected surface meshes , can be found in . \n a linear elastic law is assigned to the biomechanical model , with young modulus e = 3000  pa and poisson ratio  = 0.45 . because displacements , rather than forces , are applied to the model using a linear formulation , the fem or xfem solution is independent of young modulus e . \n we choose as surface landmarks the whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries . to evaluate the surface deformations of these region boundaries between two imr images , we use an active surface algorithm [ 55 , 56 ] . \n because these region boundaries to match must be closed surfaces , we thus use as surface landmarks the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries . \n the surface deformation of the internal tumor region boundary will be derived from the active surface algorithm of the healthy - brain region boundary . in our active surface algorithm coming from [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , the external forces f(x ) are computed using a gradient descent on a distance map of the region boundary . with such external forces , the active surface algorithm is not able to take correctly into account local rigid motion due , as an example , to lateral or tangential movement depending on the head orientation . for the whole - brain region , any rigid transformation that could have occurred \n has already been taken into account by the rigid registration of the imr images ( section 4.1 ) . however , for the healthy - brain region , it can happen that the internal tumor region boundary moves partly in a rigid way . \n therefore , the active surface , initialized from the healthy - brain region boundary in the first imr image , is first locally transformed in a rigid way along the internal tumor region boundary using the iterative closest point transform available in vtk . \n then , this resulting surface is deformed using the active surface algorithm as explained above . \n further details on the local rigid registration of the healthy - brain region boundary can be found in . before applying the displacements whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries to the biomechanical model nodes , \n the two surface displacement fields are smoothed based on a weighted - distance average , that is , the displacement of each node is averaged with the displacements of its n closest neighbor nodes . \n this smoothing will make them consistent with each other , and compatible with the volume mesh in order to avoid element flipping , in particular at the intersections between whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries . \n the displacement fields of the surface landmarks are applied to the biomechanical model , which deforms according to the laws of solid mechanics . \n the equations of solid mechanics are solved using fem or xfem , depending upon the type of circumstances , namely , brain shift or resection . \n we use the fem - software tool metafor ( http://metafor.ltas.ulg.ac.be/ )   developed in our mechanical - engineering department , to which we have added an xfem module . \n the initial stress state of the brain is unknown and is thus set to zero for each fem or xfem computation , as in [ 10 , 13 ] . \n fem discretizes the solid of interest into a mesh , that is , into a set of fes interconnected by nodes , and approximates the displacement field u(x ) by the fem displacement field u(x ) defined as \n ( 1)ufem(x)=iii(x)ui , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the nodal shape functions ( nsfs ) , and the ui 's are the nodal degrees of freedom ( dofs ) . \n each i(x ) is defined as being continuous on its compact support i , which corresponds to the union of the domains of the fes connected to node i . in our approach , we use linear nsfs . \n in contrast , xfem handles a discontinuity by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within fes [ 37 , 5860 ] . \n the xfem displacement field generalises the fem displacement field ( 1 ) with \n ( 2)uxfem(x)=iii(x)ui+iji(x)j=1neigj(x)aji . \n the first term corresponds to the fem displacement field ( 1 ) , where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the fem nsfs , and the ui 's are the nodal fem dofs . the heart of xfem is the  enrichment  that adds a number , n , of dofs aji to each node i of the set j , which is the subset of nodes of i whose support is intersected by the discontinuity of interest . \n these dofs are multiplied by the nsfs i(x ) and the discontinuous functions gj(x ) . \n the use of specific xfem enrichment functions gj(x ) for a node i  j depends on the type of discontinuity , for example , crack , hole , material interface , and so forth , to be modeled . \n suppose that our goal is to model a crack , characterized by a discontinuity in the displacement field ( as opposed to a material interface for instance , characterized by a discontinuity in the derivative of the displacement field ) . \n when the crack fully intersects the support of the node , a simple choice is a piecewise - constant unit function that changes sign at the boundary across the crack , that is , the heaviside function \n ( 3)h(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,1for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where x is again the position of a point of the solid , x * is the position of the point on the crack that is the closest to x , and en is the outward normal to the crack at x * . in case of resection deformation , the goal is to model a discontinuity such that the part of tissues corresponding to tissue removed by the resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues . \n one is actually interested in the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues only . in that sense , \n the hole function    as the following equation :  \n ( 4)v(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,0for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t could be used as xfem enrichment function , instead of the heaviside function , and would be totally sufficient . \n the results that we would obtain on the remaining part of the tissues would be identical . \n however , because the heaviside function is necessary for retraction modeling , we have used the same function for the resection modeling even if it was not strictly necessary . when minimizing the total deformation energy , the resulting xfem equations remain sparse and symmetric as for fem . \n whereas fem requires a remeshing and the duplication of the nodes along the crack to take into account any discontinuity , xfem requires the identification of the nodes whose support is intersected by the crack and the addition of dofs : ( 1 ) any node whose support is not intersected by the discontinuity remains unaffected and thus possesses three dofs ; ( 2 ) any node whose support is fully intersected by the discontinuity is enriched with three heaviside dofs and thus possesses six dofs . to qualitatively estimate the similarity between two images , we compare the edges extracted from these images using the canny edge detector available in itk ( http://www.itk.org/ ) . \n indeed , although potentially useful for the sake of comparing methods on a mathematical basis and defining unique correspondences , landmark - based target analysis presents several relevant limitations in the present setting . having experts picking landmarks introduces significant intra- and interobserver variability . picking landmark points , as ferrant et al . \n did , is rather difficult when it comes to define enough visible landmarks  especially in the tumor region  on the 5 different images ( and not 2 images only , as majority of studies focusing on brain shift are using ) . rather than point targets , linear tumor contours , and limits between structures and potential eloquent structures matter most in the practical case of tumor ablation neurosurgery . \n these are the reason why we chose to use the canny edges in order to evaluate the registration . besides \n , while it is true that these edges do not necessarily physically correspond between the successive imr images , these images have been acquired with the same image protocol ( mr sequence , voxel size , grayscale value range ) , which should limit this problem . \n to quantitatively estimate the similarity of the two edge maps , we compute the modified hausdorff distance between the sets of edge points , that is , voxels representing the edges , in these two images . \n the modified hausdorff distance (a , b )   between two sets of points a and b is defined as \n ( 5)(a , b)=max(h(a , b),h(b , a ) )  with  h(a , b)=1naaad(a , b ) , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where the directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) is a measure of the distance of the point set a to the point set b , na is the number of points in set a , and d(a , b ) is the distance of point a  a to the closest point in b , that is , d(a , b ) = minbb||a  b|| , where ||a  b|| is the euclidean distance . \n the directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) thus computes the average distance of points of a to points of b. the averaging minimizes the effects of outlier points , for example , due to image noise . \n the value of the modified hausdorff distance (a , b ) increases with the amount of difference between the two sets of edges points . in the following , \n we denote by (ia , ib ) the modified hausdorff distance of the edges extracted from the whole - brain region of the images ia and ib , that is , with the skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out from them . \n in this section , we apply our methods , respectively , of brain shift and resection ( imr images are acquired with the 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner of the brigham and women 's hospital , boston , usa . \n imr image size is 256  256  60 voxels , and voxel size is 0.9375  0.9375  2.5  mm ) . \n two patient cases , each including five imr images , are treated to illustrate our modeling and brain shift followed by successive resections . in both cases , the 1st imr image was acquired prior to the opening of the skull ; the 2nd imr image was acquired after the opening of the skull and dura , and shows some brain shift ; the 3rd , 4th , and 5th imr images were acquired after successive resections . \n the modelings of brain shift , 1st , 2nd , and 3rd resection are performed using different techniques , as detailed below . except where otherwise noted \n , the following discussion applies to both patient cases ( the result of each deformation modeling is shown for the two patient cases at the end of section 5.2.3 ) . to model brain shift based on the 1st and 2nd imr images \n , we estimate the surface displacement fields of the whole - brain region boundary and the internal tumor region boundary from the two imr images . \n no tissue discontinuity is involved in the brain shift deformation , so the biomechanical model is deformed using fem . \n this results in the volume displacement field of the biomechanical model , which is illustrated in figure 3 for the first patient case . \n this volume displacement field is used to warp the part of the 1st imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . in the following sections , \n the three successive resections are modeled separately , because they require different types of processing . \n matching two region boundaries to get a displacement field makes sense only if they correspond to the same physical entity . \n once the resection has started , we can no longer rely on the entirety of the whole - brain region boundary , since a part of it is now missing . for modeling the successive resections , we thus evaluate the displacement field for the boundary of the healthy - brain region only . \n the 1st resection occurs between the times the 2nd and 3rd imr images are acquired . \n however , since the corresponding removal of tissues is most likely accompanied by deformation , one can not exactly determine what tissue is removed based just on the two imr images . \n we thus decided to model the 1st resection by still relying on the displacement fields of key surfaces , here the healthy - brain region boundary , to deform the biomechanical model . \n this indeed appears to be the only reliable information concerning the deformation due to resection that we can extract from the 2nd and 3rd imr images . \n consequently , we do not model explicitly the removal of tissue , but we model directly the deformation resulting from it , without introducing any tissue discontinuity . using the surface displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , we compute the deformation of the biomechanical model via fem . then , using the resulting volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 2nd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region , in the same way as we did in the case of for brain shift . \n the image resulting from the 1st resection modeling is now registered to the 3rd imr image , except outside of the healthy - brain region boundary , that is , for the tumor region . finally , we alter the resulting image to reflect the effect of resection . for this \n , we assign the background color to the voxels corresponding to the resected tissue volume \n the significant feature of the 2nd resection is that some tissue has already been removed by the 1st resection , which means that this tissue can not have any physical influence on subsequent brain deformations because it does not \n recall that the biomechanical model has been deformed to model the brain shift and the 1st resection and is thus registered to the 3rd imr image . \n so , using the 3rd imr image , we can define the boundary of the 1st resection , that is , the tissue discontinuity to include in the deformed biomechanical model ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) . \n we then enrich the nodes whose supports are intersected by the discontinuity with heaviside dofs . \n consequently , when the xfem - based biomechanical model deforms , the part corresponding to tissue removed by the 1st resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the brain . \n for the first patient case illustrated in figure 4 , the tetrahedron mesh consists of 3,317 nodes , which corresponds to 9,951 fem dofs . \n the biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 3rd and 4th imr images . \n the bottom part of the mesh , representing the tissue remaining after the 1st resection , has been deformed according to the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , while the top part , representing the tissue removed by the 1st resection , has been subjected to a translation , but only for visualization purposes . even though the mesh is displayed as two separate parts , it is , in fact , a single entity . \n indeed , a main feature of xfem is its ability to handle the effect of a discontinuity without modifying the underlying mesh , that is , without remeshing . for modeling the 2nd resection , the edges of fes straddling the discontinuity \n have been made discontinuous and their nodes moved apart . using the xfem volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 3rd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . \n the resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 4th imr image . \n one significant feature of the procedure described for modeling the 2nd resection is that it can be applied repetitively for each subsequent resection visible on successive imr images , no matter how many there are . \n the modeling of the 3rd resection is thus identical to the modeling of the 2nd resection . \n the tissue discontinuity due to the 2nd resection is defined from the 4th imr image , and used to appropriately enrich the nodes of the biomechanical model . \n then , this biomechanical model is deformed using xfem , in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 4th and 5th imr images . for the first patient case , \n a simplification for the modeling of the 3rd resection can be made because , by the time the 5th imr image is acquired , the resection is complete . \n this means that we only need to compute the volume displacement field of the healthy - brain region . \n since we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem will be identical . \n using the fem ( for the first patient case ) or xfem ( for the second patient case ) volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . the resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 5th imr image . \n figures 5 and 6 show the results of warping the imr images , as well as the edges extracted from them , after brain shift and each successive resection modeling for the two patient cases . as explained in section 5.2.3 , since we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem are identical in the healthy - brain region . \n one can deduce that using xfem for modeling resection is interesting when the neurosurgeon needs to have an accurate displacement field of the remaining tumor tissues . in this case \n , it is interesting to evaluate the impact of using fem , instead of xfem , to model the resection as if no resection was performed before . \n using fem for modeling resection is equivalent to ignoring the presence of resection on intraoperative images . to illustrate the comparison between fem and xfem results , we choose the 3rd resection modeling of the second patient case \n indeed , it is the deformation with remaining tumor tissues that shows the largest magnitude , and , thus , that is likely to give a maximum difference between the two computations . \n the healthy - brain and tumor regions segmented out from the 4th and 5th imr images are respectively shown in figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) . \n the volume displacement fields of the biomechanical model using xfem and fem are respectively shown in figures 7(c ) and 7(d ) . \n the part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region is warped , first with the volume displacement field obtained via fem , and then with that obtained via xfem . \n the difference between the two warped images is shown in figure 7(e ) . as expected \n however , the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution ( although the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution , the difference between the images resulting of the warping using these two volume displacement fields is nonzero . \n this is explained by the fact that the ( gray ) value of each voxel of the warped image is defined as a weighted - value of voxels of the original image . \n the weights are defined based on the overlapping ratio of the voxel of the warped image , with voxels ( determined using the volume displacement field ) of the original image ) . \n in addition , the deformed 4th imr images , using the xfem- and the fem - based deformations of the biomechanical model , show the same similarity , computed based on the modified hausdorff distance , with the 5th imr . \n two reasons explain that the differences between the fem and xfem results are so small . \n first , the brain deformation itself due to the 3rd resection is small , and , thus , it is expected to obtain small differences between the two resulting brain deformations . \n second , in the case the remaining tumor tissues are close to the healthy - brain region boundary , it implies that they are close to the boundary where surface displacement fields are applied to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model . \n although this comparison between fem and xfem should be done on more patient cases , we suggest that , in first approximation , fem could be used for modeling resection cases with small brain deformations . \n nevertheless , the presentation of the successive resections using xfem shows the generality of our framework , and details how xfem is implemented . \n note that in section 6 devoted to validation , the warped images are the ones deformed with xfem . \n for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images that are already rigidly registered , we compare the similarity between these ik and ik+1 images , as well as the similarity between the ik and ik+1 images , where ik is the result of warping ik . \n this gives us an estimate of how well we are able to capture , and compensate for , the local deformations between ik and ik+1 . \n the goal of the nonrigid registration is , however , to deform the preoperative images . by warping ik for each deformation modeling \n , we do not take into account the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . to evaluate the effect of this error amplification on the results \n , we also perform the required succession of warpings on i1 , and we denote the resulting image by i1,k . \n we then compare , for each deformation modeling , the similarity between i1 and ik+1 , together with the similarity between i1,k and ik+1 . \n this allows one to evaluate the propagation , that is , the amplification , of alignment error on the results . \n the modified hausdorff distance computed for each pair of imr images are given in tables 1 and 2 . \n table 1 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (ik , ik+1 ) and (ik , ik+1 ) . \n these values are computed using the canny edges extracted from the pair of images ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( d ) and 6 ( d ) ) and ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( e ) and 6 ( e ) ) . \n we observe that the values for the images nonrigidly registered are relatively constant , that is , 1  mm , for each deformation modeling . \n six out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are ( rigidly and subsequently ) nonrigidly registered . \n however , the modified hausdorff distance increases for the 3rd resection modeling of the first patient case , as well as for the brain shift modeling of the second patient case . to understand \n if the nonrigid registration is responsible for the increase of the misalignment of the two imr images everywhere in the whole - brain region , or if this effect is localized , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the region and neighborhood of the tumor only ( volume region that extents by 25  mm the tumor region segmented in i1 for both patient cases ) . \n the modified hausdorff distance decreases from (i4 , i5 ) = 1.70  mm to (i4 , i5 ) = 1.37  mm for the first patient case , while it decreases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.36  mm to (i1 , i2 ) = 1.28  mm for the second patient case . \n this indicates that the nonrigid registration enhances the alignment of the two imr images within the tumor region and its neighborhood , which is in fact the location requiring the best modeling accuracy . \n this behavior could be explained by the fact that a maximum of information from the imr images is used in this region , that is , one or two ( in case of brain shift modeling ) surface displacement fields are applied around it . \n the increase of misalignment elsewhere in the brain volume could be explained by two reasons . \n first , the landmarks tracked from the imr images are surfaces . as a consequence , the nonrigid registration is expected to give better results near the tracked surfaces than far from them in the volume . \n the volume misalignment could point out the need for better parameters values and/or other constitutive laws . \n table 2 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (i1 , ik+1 ) and (i1,k , ik+1 ) . \n so far , igns systems allow one to rigidly register preoperative and successive imr images . \n (i1 , ik+1 ) thus represents the navigation accuracy that we can obtain with an igns system at the present time . \n the comparison of (i1 , ik+1 ) with (i1,k , ik+1 ) gives the improvement that could be practically achieved in the alignment with our approach . \n as expected , table 2 shows that the igns accuracy decreases through the successive deformations . \n indeed , the modified hausdorff distance increases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.24  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.78  mm for the first patient case , and from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.01  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.68  mm for the second patient case . \n six out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are nonrigidly registered . \n to understand if the modified hausdorff distance increases everywhere in the whole - brain region for the brain shift and 1st resection modeling of the second patient case , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the neighborhood of the tumor region ( in the same way as explained for table 1 ) , and observe the improvement of the alignment within the tumor region and its neighborhood . as opposed to the values of the modified hausdorff distances in table 1 , the values for the images nonrigidly registered in table 2 increase through the successive resection modeling . \n this amplification error is due to the fact that , after having modeled brain deformation between a pair of imr images , the deformed biomechanical model is not in perfect alignment with the second image of the pair . \n since , for the subsequent deformation modeling , the surface landmarks are initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , this can thus ampliy a misregistration error . \n we developed a complete 3d framework for serial preoperative image update in the presence of brain shift followed by successive resections . \n the nonrigid registration technique used an homogeneous linear elastic biomechanical model , driven by the deformations of whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries for brain shift modeling , and healthy - brain region boundary for resection modelings , tracked between successive imr images . \n the biomechanical model was deformed using fem for brain shift modeling , and fem or xfem for resection modeling , depending upon whether some brain tissues were previously resected or not . \n we showed that our approach was modular , and could be applied each time a new imr image is acquired . \n we used a linear formulation to characterize the deformation of the brains of both patients because the brains underwent relatively small deformations and displacements . \n while nonlinear biomechanical models have proven effective to decrease  yet do not abolish  the inaccuracies of fem - based modeling methods of large brain deformations , the deformations observed in our patients during surgery remained moderate ( 47  mm ) , thus reducing the theoretical benefit of using nonlinear models . \n this allowed us to use simpler linear models and focus on the added value of xfem to simultaneously account for surgical deformations , namely , shift and resection . using a linear formulation \n implied that , for each new deformation modeling , one could use the initial configuration rather than the last - deformed configuration of the biomechanical model . \n this had the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively degraded with each successive deformation modeling . \n this also had the advantage that we did no longer need to reconnect the deformed mesh for each new xfem calculation , which was one drawback of our previous method , presented in [ 39 , 41 ] , where the biomechanical model was successively deformed . \n we also showed how xfem could handle a discontinuity for modeling resection without any remeshing or mesh adaptation while the representation of the discontinuity remained accurate , that is , the representation of the discontinuity was not based on a jagged topology using fe facets . \n xfem thus also avoided making the mesh resolution richer in the neighborhood of the resection - cavity boundary for improving the accuracy of the representation of the discontinuity for that purpose only . \n we showed that our nonrigid registration technique improved the alignment of the successive imr images for most of the deformation modeling of both patient cases . when our nonrigid registration failed , it still improved the alignment locally , that is , within the tumor region and its neighborhood . \n we tested the explicit modeling of the lateral ventricles ' region with a soft , compressible law in addition to the whole - brain region law used in the homogeneous biomechanical model . \n in addition to the validation that is usually performed for successive deformation modelings , that is , validation between pairs of successive intraoperative images , shown in table 1 of section 6 or in the work of ferrant et al . \n [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , we also evaluated the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . as a result , shown in table 2 of section 6 \n , we showed that our approach suffered from the propagation of misregistration through the successive deformation modelings . \n we expected that this was due , at least partly , to the algorithms used to evaluate intraoperative surface displacements fields from the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries . \n the surface displacement fields were computed using active surface algorithms , and smoothed to make them compatible with the biomechanical model . \n because of these two smoothings , the deformed biomechanical model was likely to not be in a perfect alignment with the imr image to which it was registered . \n because the surface displacement fields evaluated for the next deformation modeling were initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , we expected to observe an amplification of the misregistration , which was confirmed by our quantitative evaluation . at the present time \n though , commercial igns systems allow one to register preoperative images and successive imr images , but in a rigid way only . \n consequently , although the effect of error amplification exists , our technique still enhances the current capabilities of commercial igns systems . \n future work on modeling of brain shift followed by successive resection is required in five main areas . \n first , the effect of error amplification through the successive brain deformation modelings calls for further research . \n consequently , the segmentation , and the subsequent smoothing , as well as the evaluation of surface displacement fields , should be improved to minimize the effect of error amplification . \n second , further research is required to include additional structures in the biomechanical model in general , and to study the best way to include the lateral ventricles in particular . \n the use of a poroelastic model in order to model the cerebrospinal fluid filling the ventricles could be considered [ 17 , 18 ] . \n indeed , these images provide volume information ( rather than surface information only ) , are of good quality in comparison to other intraoperative modalities , and possess a field of view that includes the full volume of brain tissues ( for the 0.5 tesla ge signa scanner ) . \n these images thus allow one to evaluate what , and how , new structures of the brain could be used , to enhance the modeling of brain shift . \n some regions , for example , the lateral ventricles ' region , could be extracted from the two imr images , and used as surface landmarks to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model [ 13 , 62 ] . indeed , the workflow presented in this paper has the advantage of being easily adaptable . in case \n the tumor region would not be visible ( enough ) on the imr images , these new structures , easier to segment , could also adequately replace the tumor for driving the deformation . \n fourth , our global approach should no longer be based on the 1st imr image used as a substitute for preoperative images , but on the preoperative images themselves . \n fifth , we should implement , for the surgery cases involving large deformations of the brain , a nonlinear formulation of fem [ 63 , 64 ] , and , particularly , a nonlinear formulation of xfem , which is the subject of recent research [ 65 , 66 ] .",
         "current neuronavigation systems can not adapt to changing intraoperative conditions over time . to overcome this limitation \n , we present an experimental end - to - end system capable of updating 3d preoperative images in the presence of brain shift and successive resections . the heart of our system is a nonrigid registration technique using a biomechanical model , driven by the deformations of key surfaces tracked in successive intraoperative images . \n the biomechanical model is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection . \n we describe the operation of our system on two patient cases , each comprising five intraoperative mr images , and we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the alignment of nonrigidly registered images .",

         "acquired angioedema ( aae ) , an acquired deficiency of c1esterase inhibitor , is a medically treatable condition which can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen . \n this disorder is strongly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) and other indolent lymphoplasmacytic disorders . \n we describe a patient with known cll who developed incapacitating , recurrent severe abdominal pains , culminating in partial bowel resection . \n wider appreciation of the possibility of aae , particularly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders , could lead to preventive therapy and spare unnecessary surgery . \n acquired angioedema ( aae ) is due to acquired deficiency of c1 inhibitor ( c1inh ) , resulting in excessive complement and bradykinin activities . \n blood vessel permeability is increased ; thus , angioedema occurs . just as with hereditary angioedema ( hereditary c1inh deficiency ; hae ) , common clinical manifestations are skin swelling , laryngeal edema , and/or abdominal pain.1,2 aae often occurs in the context of lymphoplasmacytic disorders , such as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance ( mgus ) , non - hodgkin s lymphoma , or chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll).1,3 among 32 patients with aae , castelli found that 13 ( 40% ) had mgus and 9 ( 28% ) had lymphoproliferative disease.3 therefore , all cases of aae should be evaluated for the possibility of underlying lymphoplasmacytic disorder . \n conversely , when patients with known lymphoproliferative disease manifest compatible symptoms , aae should be expeditiously considered . \n this is important because aae can be effectively treated medically , but delayed diagnosis can lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures , therapeutic interventions , or life - threatening complications , well - illustrated by our case . \n a 78-year - old woman with atherosclerotic vascular disease was transferred to our hospital with abdominal pain and underwent emergent laparotomy . \n one year earlier , she had been diagnosed with rai stage i cll which had been observed without treatment . \n two months earlier , she presented with severe abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting . over the next 8  weeks , she had six emergency room and/or hospital admissions for identical symptoms . \n pains would begin at rest in the lower abdomen , spread to the upper abdomen , described as  gas - like  , non - radiating , constant . \n extensive evaluation included colonoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , magnetic resonance angiography , and abdominal aortography . \n benign colon polyps and small gallstones were removed , mesenteric stenoses ruled out , yet pains recurred unabated . \n there was no dysphagia , change in bowel habits , gi bleeding , fever , or sweats . \n physical examination on transfer revealed blood pressure 130/88  mmhg , pulse 88 beats per minute , respiratory rate 20  cycles per minute , pulse oximetry of 95% on ambient air , and temperature 97.0f . \n hemoglobin was 18.1  g / dl , hematocrit 55% , platelets 146    10/l , and leukocytes elevated to 34,500 cells/l with 47% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes . \n ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with iv contrast showed multiple abnormal loops of small bowel with contrast - enhanced bowel wall edema ( fig . \n . 1a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast shows several abnormal loops of small bowel with a target appearance indicating bowel wall edema . \n b a section of small bowel shows massive submucosal edema . there is no infiltration of the wall by lymphocytes a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast shows several abnormal loops of small bowel with a target appearance indicating bowel wall edema . \n b a section of small bowel shows massive submucosal edema . there is no infiltration of the wall by lymphocytes at laparotomy , massively swollen small bowel was encountered and resected . \n c4 was 3  mg / dl ( normal 1746 ) , c3 66  mg / dl ( 85200 ) , and c1inh activity reportedly 83% ( 68200% ) . \n serum protein electrophoresis revealed two faint bands immunofixing as monoclonal igm kappa and igg kappa . \n lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy improved and c1inh activity increased to 110% . over 3  years of follow - up , abdominal symptoms never recurred . \n approximately 145 cases have been reported of aae,3 and this is one of four cases that we have diagnosed in the last decade with abdominal pains from aae with associated cll . \n table  1 shows characteristics of patients with cll and aae we have seen ( some briefly mentioned in a prior report).4 this is our only case to undergo surgery , allowing unique and dramatic demonstration of massive bowel edema visible radiographically , on surgical inspection and on histopathology . \n an initial c1inh activity was reported low normal , but there can be no doubt about the diagnosis based on radiologic / surgical / histologic findings , further laboratory results , and the clinical course . \n characteristic are very low c4 level and low c3 ;

         "brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . to evaluate the advantages and the restrictions of the technique , a cadaveric study of supraclavicular and axillary approaches was conducted . \n we found that the axillary approach was useful and advantageous for lower roots , particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome ( tos ) . \n this report will focus on the evaluation of axillary robotic approach as the advantages and disadvantages of supraclavicular robotic intervention have been widely discussed in the literature . \n a human cadaver was subjected to this experiment in paris university ecole europenne de chirurgie anatomy laboratory and da vinci robot system was used . \n the left arm was tucked along the side and the right arm was placed in a semiflexed position extending toward the anesthesia location near the head , supported by foam and blankets ( figure 1 ) . \n a 6  cm long incision was made at the right axillar line , lateral to the edge of the pectoralis major muscle ( figure 2 ) . \n a self - retaining chung retractor was placed into the incision to elevate the pectoralis major muscle flap . \n the robot was docked as a camera ; right and left robotic arm were adapted in the incision area ( figure 3 ) . a 10  mm 0 downlooking scope , maryland forceps , and a curved scissors \n the working space was maintained with the self - retaining retractor , without co2 insufflation ( figure 4 ) . \n the subclavian artery was seen in front of the truncus and was positioned to the posterior of the working space . \n subclavian artery was dissected from the plexus and truncus of the lower plexus was exposed with blunt dissection . \n the plexus was exposed thoroughly from t1 to c7 levels . in this surgical setting , the operating surgeon , who has \n a wide experience in open brachial surgery of the brachial plexus , reported that lower brachial plexus exposure was easier from the axillary working area and a more wide range of motion was achieved to manipulate the robotic tools compared to the supraclavicular exposure for lower part of the brachial plexus . \n the development of robotic - assisted minimally invasive techniques began in urology , general surgery , and gynecology because of the generally large working spaces available in the abdomen for these types of surgeries [ 14 ] . \n since then , other surgeons have sought to use robotic devices in other areas , such as the brachial plexus [ 5 , 6 ] . \n brachial plexus dysfunction can be the result of shoulder trauma [ 7 , 8 ] . \n it can also occur with tos , which encompasses three separate disorders involving compression of the subclavian artery , subclavian vein , or brachial plexus in the triangular space bordered by the first rib , clavicle , and scalene muscles [ 9 , 10 ] . \n compression of the vessel - nerve package at the thoracic inlet has been treated with soft - tissue ( scalene muscle ) release and/or bone ( first rib ) resection . \n surgical approaches to first rib resection may be transthoracic , transaxillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , or thoracoscopic [ 9 , 10 ] . however , these approaches are typically associated with incomplete resection of the most medial portion of the first rib and neurovascular complications . \n theoretically , a minimally invasive transthoracic approach can obviate these problems , enabling complete resection of the offending portion of the first rib without neurovascular complication . \n , respectively , reported successful results of robotic en bloc first rib resection for tos treatment via transthoracic and transaxillary approaches [ 9 , 11 ] . \n 's techniques were only bony interventions and as being intrathoracic these need to be lung collapsed and lung complication can be waiting risk . \n although liverneaux et al . reported techniques and results of upper brachial plexus injury intervention via robotic surgery with a supraclavicular approach , they described the disadvantages as a narrow working space and difficulty to expose the c7 vertebra [ 1 , 5 , 12 ] . to our knowledge , this report is the first to objectively describe robotic axillar brachial plexus exposure . \n thus , we discuss the theoretical and clinical advantages and disadvantages of the axillary approach in the present report . \n the development of robot - assisted surgery has revealed new perspectives in peripheral nerve microsurgery . minimally invasive \n robot - assisted surgery could lead to modification of the classic algorithm for the treatment of traumatic brachial plexus lesions [ 6 , 8 ] . to date , exploration of these lesions has not been attempted less than 3 months after the traumatic event because clinical examination can not provide an accurate diagnosis or reliable prognosis in these first weeks . \n early intervention may enable initial assessment of the lesion and repair of potentially graftable nerve roots . \n several robotics properties are particularly adapted to microsurgery , such as high - resolution three - dimensional ( 3d ) visualization with up to 40 magnification , up to 10-fold magnification of surgical movements , elimination of physiological tremors , and the provision of ergonomic work conditions for otherwise uncomfortable surgery . \n robotic surgical systems allow high - definition magnified 3d visualization of the operative field , provide significant instrument maneuverability , even within a confined space , and may overcome the shortcomings of conventional approaches [ 2 , 5 ] . \n axillary ( infraclavicular ) brachial plexus intervention via robotic surgery has not been described previously . \n axillary intervention was previously performed as an open procedure to expose the plexus or resect the first rib for the treatment of tos . \n martinez et al . described first rib resection via robotic surgery but not to address plexus injury without transthoracic exposure , a novel minimally invasive approach to the first rib from inside of the chest . \n in addition , gharagozloo et al . reported first rib resection via transthoracic robotic surgery for paget - schroetter disease . \n 's techniques were considered more useful for lower brachial plexus viewing and assessing according to gharagozloo et al . \n the experience of the whole surgical team with robotic technology is important for the procedure . during learning curve period , \n two staff surgeons are required to participate in all procedures to ensure the safety of the program [ 5 , 9 ] . \n martinez et al . reported importance of the learning curve , not only for the surgeon but also for the entire surgical team and 180 minutes for the initial 10 cases . \n reported exclusion criteria include a history of previous incision in the same area and obesity , which present difficulties in robotic surgery initiation . \n other drawbacks of this new surgical approach are the increased cost of surgical equipment and longer operating time , especially during the learning curve period . \n however , we believe that the avoidance of a classic incision leads to significant patient satisfaction for cosmetic reasons and we believe that demand for this procedure from a select group of patients justifies the exploration of alternative ways to avoid classic brachial plexus exposure . \n this report presents our initial experience with robot - assisted axillary exposure of the brachial plexus region . in our opinion \n robotic surgery will be used routinely in the future for brachial plexus surgery and particularly for tos that is caused by bone and/or soft tissue . however , newer dedicated surgical instruments need to be developed and further studies should be conducted to evaluate in vivo application and results of this novel approach .",
         "brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . \n although the supraclavicular approach is a well known described and used procedure for robotic surgery , axillary approach was unknown for brachial plexus surgery . \n a cadaveric study was planned to evaluate the robotic axillary approach for brachial plexus surgery . \n our results showed that robotic surgery is a very useful method and should be used routinely for brachial plexus surgery and particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome . \n however , we emphasize that new instruments should be designed and further studies are needed to evaluate in vivo results .",

         "older people have particular spiritual needs that are distinct from those of others , particularly in times of ill health and death and dying . \n it has been reported that spirituality has a positive effect on health outcomes and welfare of the elderly . \n nowadays , aging phenomenon and relevant problems with its complexities are important issues that have attracted the attention of social and medical scientists to investigate the spiritual needs of the elderly . \n spiritual health is a dimension of health that is portrayed as the validation of life in relation to god , fellow human beings , and the environment . \n spirituality is the representative of the basic values that guide a person in searching to find answers to the crucial questions of life , such as the purpose and meaning of life , reality , love , good and bad , disease , and death .   over the past three decades , spirituality , religion , and prayer \n have turned into a subject of large interest for researchers in medicine , nursing , gerontology , physical health and mental health disciplines , often in conjunction with complementary and alternative medicine . \n this tendency has been stimulated by research demonstrating physical and psychological benefits of spiritual and religious involvements . \n in fact , approximately 96% of adults in the united states expressed their belief in god , and 72% of identified religion and spirituality as having the most important influence in their lives . saying prayers is a regular daily task for muslims which begins at the age of puberty and continues throughout the life . \n it is a time getting rid of the material world and approaching the world beyond , as well as , to the inner self . in iran , elderly people are more religious than younger ones , and this is a norm of this culture . \n a recent national survey of the iranians values and attitudes found that over 80% of the iranians practice prayer regularly as a part of their religion . \n one might argue that this is a true reflection of individual culture where prayer and religious beliefs are a part of people 's everyday life . \n however , prayer can go beyond just performing a religious duty , and based on one 's wishes , take different forms of formal and informal practices . \n it has been shown that disease prevalence , incidence and mortality rates differ from one population to another . \n this is partly ascribed to their disparities in lifestyle , dietary habits and other characteristics that are somehow affected by culture , especially religious traditions and experiences .   during the past two decades \n some studies have been carried out and the associations between religious beliefs or experiences and various types of physical illnesses , mental health , and mortality have been examined . \n spirituality is viewed as personally important matter to the older people and it has been proved that it is highly related to older people 's health outcomes . \n however , there has not been adequate experiential research on the relationship between religious or spiritual factors and healthy lifestyle behaviors , and their impact on the adult 's well - being . \n scientists believe that probing the effects of religious and spiritual factors as well as healthy lifestyle behaviors may be decisive . \n additionally , social science and medical research have concurrently reported that older adults are more inclined to take spiritual chase than younger people are . \n kotrotsiou - barboutal et al.(2006 ) indicated that older adults are remaining members of religious associations without necessarily participating regularly in services , as there are numerous issues that can diminish the active participation in religious events , such as transportation intricacies , bad sound , or the illegibility of small font text in books of prayers available at mosques or religious centers . in spite of those complexities , \n many elderly manage to find out a way to come up to god through prayer . \n it is stated that prayer increases the feelings of personal value of an elderly by reducing the feelings of loneliness and desertation , while television and radio provide support for spiritual life .   in this regard , researchers have shown that some groups of elderly people with inadequate and difficult livelihood situations communicate their problems by putting their trust in god . moreover , more than half of the elder patients practiced spiritual needs throughout their hospitalization period , with the most prominent need of being in the search of the meaning of life . \n extensive epidemiological studies have shown that higher levels of religiousness are related to lower mortality rates . \n studies identified the multidimensional nature of religiousness and spirituality and investigated various religious dimensions , for instance private religious behaviors , devotion , spiritual transcendence , and religious adaptation . \n for example , it was indicated that some aspects of religiousness predicted lower rates of disability and illness , alcoholism , cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and myocardial infarction . \n furthermore , clinical research has suggested that spirituality can play a vital role in the recovery of patients suffering from physical and psychological diseases . \n it seems that religious obligation has a crucial role in averting physical and mental diseases , recovery promotion , and disease adaptation . \n numerous studies have revealed the positive involvement of spirituality and religious indexes on different aspects of health such as cardiac surgery , mortality , immunity system function and self esteem . \n above all , religious involvement can be useful for psychological well - being and physical health . \n additionally , supporting the effect of spirituality may become more and more prominent in later life as a result of declining health , social and financial sources . \n researchers have proposed numerous psychological , social , and physiological interveners that may explain the spirituality - health association . \n quantitative measurements and the evaluation of spiritual beliefs are difficult because quantitative studies neither reveal the content , components of the beliefs , and its factors , nor the contexts that might be included . therefore , implementing qualitative research that explores the personal and experiential aspects of beliefs seems crucial , and may shed light on a range of important issues which can be investigated in detail on larger samples by further quantitative studies in future . \n spiritual or religious beliefs may affect the decisions of individuals that make about their health and illness . \n thus , recognizing and understanding the spiritual and religious behaviors within the context of cultural influence by a qualitative research is critical for nurse and other health - care providers . \n the main strengths of the present study are that it focuses on the spiritual life of healthy elderly people . \n therefore , the present study aimed to explore the concept of spirituality from the perspectives of iranian healthy elderly people . the central question of the paper was  what characterizes the spirituality in the iranian healthy older people ? \n in this research , a qualitative approach was adopted using conventional content analysis of unstructured interviews carried out with 17 healthy elderly people in tehran in 2010 - 2011 . \n it is worth noting that spirituality is underpinned by personal and cultural context in any community ; therefore , qualitative research is the best method to study cultural context - bound subjects . \n initially purposeful sampling was used and continued with purposeful sampling according to the codes and categories emerged from data . \n the study consisted of 17 healthy elders within the age range of 65 - 86 . \n criteria for selection were having age above 65 , living with family , not having any cognitive problems , not having any physical limitation in adl , and willingness to participate in the study . \n all participants were shia muslims . in order to achieve the wide range of experiences and perceptions of elderly participants , some field notes writing and 21 interviews were conducted according to emerged codes and categories from data . the first researcher communicated with each of the participants to describe the purpose of research and research questions . \n based on the participants preference , the interviews were performed in a private room at the house of elderly , park , worksite , or mosque , using an individual semi - structured interview format and this was primarily the main method for data collection . \n interview query consisted of open - ended questions to allow respondents thoroughly to describe their opinions , perceptions , and experiences . \n the participants were asked to describe one day of their life and then to explain their own experiences and perceptions about  spirituality in elderly adults  . \n what is your experience concerning the spirituality in later age? and  what is the meaning of spirituality in your experience ? \n each interview was transcribed verbatim and analyzed before the next interview was done , so that each interview supplied bearing for the next . \n coding was carried out line by line , and comparative analysis of the quotations was carried out . \n all interviews were conducted in a single session , at the request and preference of participants , except for two cases that took two sessions . \n each interview session ranged from 30 minutes to 90 minute with an average of 55 minutes . \n data were collected and analyzed over a six - month -- period in 2009 . in the first phase , subcategories and their domains in the data were identified and classified into categories . \n the coding process was iterative , and categories evolved ( inserted , deleted and combined ) as re - readings were completed and analyses progressed . in the second phase , the subcategories and domains were regrouped into major categories . \n credibility was recognized through prolonged engagement with the participants , field note writing , the participants revisions using member checking procedure , and peer checking . \n the findings and explanations of this study were reviewed by two supervisors who were associate professors in nursing having a good background in qualitative research methodology . also , maximum variation of sampling established the conformability and credibility of the data . \n this study provided sufficient descriptive data for researchers to criticize whether the findings were transferable that established applicability . \n permission to conduct this study was obtained from the ethics committee of tarbiat modares university . \n other ethical issues in this study included the assurance of confidentiality and anonymity of the participants and their responses . \n all participants were aware of the purpose of the study , and their participation in the study was optional . \n informed consent form was obtained from the participants who agreed to participate in the study according to the provisions of the declaration of helsinki . \n in this research , a qualitative approach was adopted using conventional content analysis of unstructured interviews carried out with 17 healthy elderly people in tehran in 2010 -

86 . \n also , 15 out of 21 were married , four were widowed , and one was single . \n five participants were illiterate , four were primary degree holders , eight had a diploma , two had bachelor degrees , and two had msc degree in human sciences . in terms of their occupation status , two were employees , 13 were pensioners , two was manual worker , and three were housewives . \n three main categories emerged from the data and 3 - 4 distinctive subcategories within each category were identified . \n these categories and their subcategories represent the main factors influencing the spirituality in iranian elderly people . \n main categories and subcategories one of the main categories that emerged from data analysis was  spiritual health  . four subcategories ; \n saying prayer as a calming factor  ,  beneficence as a way to god  ,  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , and  faith , a way to happiness  , emerged from the participants experiences . \n also many of the participants considered the prayer time as an opportunity for purification which made them more tolerant to the adversities and has a calming effect on them . \n i want to say that waking up early in the morning , having the spirit for things like prayer , citing quran verses , thanking god for his blessings and doing exercise would make you quiet and happy until the end of the day  . \n ( male ) most participants believed that dealing with the affairs of the elderly and giving them a helping hand in their lives have positive consequences for the servers . \n they also believed that doing good things to older adults will lead them to pray for the servers which in turn cause good things in the servers lives . \n they said that man would receive god 's blessings as a consequence of his / her deeds in the world . \n additionally , they believed that the ultimate consequence of good deeds was good in return . \n if she asks me to fix her air conditioner you can be sure that i ll do it . \n this is because i think that by doing this i make her happy and she prays for me . \n , the participants said that in iran the elderly people feel psychologically and spiritually alone and they do not receive any institutionally based mental and spiritual support . \n when i think about my life , i feel that i do n't have any support from my children . \n also in the street and road we do n't have appropriate social respect and i want to say that in our society there is limited support and backing for people like me . \n ( female ) the elderly participants lived experiences disclosed the subcategory of  faith , a way to happiness  in life . \n one of participants described that having strong faith was very important over the elderly life and adopting a healthy life style depended mostly on their faith and beliefs . \n also , they stressed that faith will lead them to a sense of physical and mental welfare and happiness . \n the one who has strong faith and beliefs is always happy and confident . in my opinion \n worshiping god , praying , fasting , reciting quran , purity and attending mosques are important elements in life , and bring happiness to your life and set your soul free  . \n ( male )  spiritual beliefs  was a main category that emerged from the participants lived experiences of spiritual concept and this category was further subcategorized into three subcategories including  seeking help from god in difficulties \n doing good deeds is the god 's will  . regarding the subcategory of  seeking help from god in difficulties \n , the participants believed that wishing for and seeking help from god can help the elderly people to deal better with life difficulties , disperses and stresses . \n this desire results in god 's attention to elderly and also creates sense of trust in older adults . \n some statements said by participants are :  i really believe in having trust in god . when i m trapped in a complicated situation \n , i believe that this is god who helps me and i only trust in god .  ( male ) one participant believed that spirituality was a vital component of older people lives . \n also , he believed that god was the ultimate source to affect my life or death and he controls everything . \n we re all waiting to see when the angel of death arrives and takes us away . \n ( male ) concerning the subcategory of  doing good deeds is the god 's will  , the participants believed that trust in god guided them to many positive activities in their lives . \n they believed that calling the name of god while getting out of house , remembering him throughout the daytime and praying will lead them to prosperity . \n one participant said that trust in god , submitting to god 's will and thinking about god all the time helped him to work and deal with anybody without any behavioral problems . \n when i want to get out of my house for work , e first thing that comes to mind is that \n my dear god : bestow upon me everything which is good for me and while i m out working , i do my best not to misbehave or do anything bad to anybody .  ( male ) another most important category that emerged was religious practice with three distinctive subcategories including : saying prayers , reciting quran , and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage . \n the majority of the participants indicated that they had good knowledge of quran , said prayers regularly , and went to mosque for religious and social activities . \n for example one participant said that participating in religious settings and ceremonies led her to find new friends and got her out of loneliness . \n we go to quran classes on friday mornings also.(male )  i have so much interest for pilgrimage and saying daily payers at the earliest recommended time when call for prayer is announced . \n i go to the religious rites with the my friends and peers , and i want to get out of loneliness . \n ( female ) thus , it can be concluded that all of the participants rose early to start their religious acts of devotion , prayers , and worship in their home or mosque . \n one of the main categories that emerged from data analysis was  spiritual health  . \n four subcategories ;  saying prayer as a calming factor  ,  beneficence as a way to god  ,  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , and  faith , a way to happiness  , emerged from the participants experiences . \n also many of the participants considered the prayer time as an opportunity for purification which made them more tolerant to the adversities and has a calming effect on them . \n i want to say that waking up early in the morning , having the spirit for things like prayer , citing quran verses , thanking god for his blessings and doing exercise would make you quiet and happy until the end of the day  . \n ( male ) most participants believed that dealing with the affairs of the elderly and giving them a helping hand in their lives have positive consequences for the servers . \n they also believed that doing good things to older adults will lead them to pray for the servers which in turn cause good things in the servers lives . \n they said that man would receive god 's blessings as a consequence of his / her deeds in the world . \n additionally , they believed that the ultimate consequence of good deeds was good in return . \n if she asks me to fix her air conditioner you can be sure that i ll do it . \n this is because i think that by doing this i make her happy and she prays for me . \n ( female ) moreover regarding  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , the participants said that in iran the elderly people feel psychologically and spiritually alone and they do not receive any institutionally based mental and spiritual support . \n when i think about my life , i feel that i do n't have any support from my children . \n also in the street and road we do n't have appropriate social respect and i want to say that in our society there is limited support and backing for people like me . \n ( female ) the elderly participants lived experiences disclosed the subcategory of  faith , a way to happiness  in life . \n one of participants described that having strong faith was very important over the elderly life and adopting a healthy life style depended mostly on their faith and beliefs . \n also , they stressed that faith will lead them to a sense of physical and mental welfare and happiness . \n the one who has strong faith and beliefs is always happy and confident . in my opinion \n worshiping god , praying , fasting , reciting quran , purity and attending mosques are important elements in life , and bring happiness to your life and set your soul free  . \n spiritual beliefs  was a main category that emerged from the participants lived experiences of spiritual concept and this category was further subcategorized into three subcategories including  seeking help from god in difficulties  ,  only god 's power over life and death  , and \n doing good deeds is the god 's will  . regarding the subcategory of  seeking help from god in difficulties  , the participants believed \n that wishing for and seeking help from god can help the elderly people to deal better with life difficulties , disperses and stresses . \n this desire results in god 's attention to elderly and also creates sense of trust in older adults . \n some statements said by participants are :  i really believe in having trust in god . when i m trapped in a complicated situation \n , i believe that this is god who helps me and i only trust in god .  ( male ) one participant believed that spirituality was a vital component of older people lives . \n also , he believed that god was the ultimate source to affect my life or death and he controls everything . \n we re all waiting to see when the angel of death arrives and takes us away . \n ( male ) concerning the subcategory of  doing good deeds is the god 's will  , the participants believed that trust in god guided them to many positive activities in their lives . \n they believed that calling the name of god while getting out of house , remembering him throughout the daytime and praying will lead them to prosperity . \n one participant said that trust in god , submitting to god 's will and thinking about god all the time helped him to work and deal with anybody without any behavioral problems . \n when i want to get out of my house for work , e first thing that comes to mind is that \n my dear god : bestow upon me everything which is good for me and while i m out working , i do my best not to misbehave or do anything bad to anybody .  ( male ) \n another most important category that emerged was religious practice with three distinctive subcategories including : saying prayers , reciting quran , and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage . \n the majority of the participants indicated that they had good knowledge of quran , said prayers regularly , and went to mosque for religious and social activities . \n for example one participant said that participating in religious settings and ceremonies led her to find new friends and got her out of loneliness . \n we go to quran classes on friday mornings also.(male )  i have so much interest for pilgrimage and saying daily payers at the earliest recommended time when call for prayer is announced . \n i go to the religious rites with the my friends and peers , and i want to get out of loneliness . \n ( female ) thus , it can be concluded that all of the participants rose early to start their religious acts of devotion , prayers , and worship in their home or mosque . \n this qualitative study describes the concept of spirituality and its impression on iranian elderly people daily living behaviors . \n the findings are significant as they reveal that the living experiences of saying prayer as a calming factor , beneficence as a way to god , loss of psychological and spiritual support , and faith , a way to happiness , are the most important domain and subcategory of spiritual health of elderly people , which can positively affect their health . on the other hand spiritual health \n is an important dimension of human health and it can determine the individual integrity . also spiritual health is a power that coordinates physical , mental and social dimensions and is necessary in coping with diseases . when spiritual health will is at serious risk , individuals may be stricken by mental disorders such as loneliness , depression , and loss of meaning . \n there are a number of studies that support the beneficial effects of spirituality on health . \n behaviors such as reliance on god , pilgrimage and praying create hope and positive attitudes that lead to internal serenity , peacefulness and meaningful life . \n most faithful people describe their relationship with god as a relationship with an intimate friend and believe that they can control the effect of irrepressible situations by having recourse to god . \n all in all , religious adaptation relies on beliefs and religious activities and help people to control their stress and physical disorders . having meaning and goal in life , sense of belonging to a sublime source , hope for gods support in time of trouble and social and spiritual support are among the sources that help religious people to suffer less from hardships of life . in the iranian society context , where the majority of the population are muslim , and \n a religious culture is dominant in the society , it is expected that tendency to spirituality could be affect their health . \n praying is the expression of soul and a deep human instinct that arises from human soul and is uttered with profound words . \n it is neither dependent upon any particular spirituality nor entailed in any time and place . \n the content of praying includes confession of sins and weakness , pleading for forgiveness , bliss and closeness to god . \n praying reduces mental and psychological pains , releases personal emotions , leading individual to attain eternal source of power . \n weeping that often comes with praying greatly helps a person to release his or her distress and emotions . \n also prayer helped participants to cope with disease and gave them calm , hope and inner strength . \n in this regard , quran has put it magnificently :  those who have faith in god and inundate their hearts with name of god , surely god remembrance ascertains their hearts  ( ( quran , chapter 13 : sureh 13 , al - rad ) verse 28 ) . \n many americans , regardless of their health status , rely on their religious and spiritual beliefs to cope with stressful life events . \n the present study has demonstrated that one of the most important factors that help elderly in confronting with difficulties was seeking help from god . \n several studies noted that spirituals beliefs had positive influence on welfare and personal and social life of elderly people . \n effective spiritual coping strategies help individuals find meaning and purpose in their life , problems and difficulties . for instance \n , one study showed that healthy older adults believed that a higher power supports them and that having a relationship with god forms a foundation for their psychological well - being . \n thus , spirituality plays an important role in the lives of healthy individuals , too . \n believing in support from spiritual / religious resource and connectedness with a higher power is beneficial and it can affect issues of control , quality of life , spiritual well - being , coping , depression , decision - making , and possibly health outcomes . \n for instance , it has been reported that healthy older adults believe that a higher power supports them and that having a relationship with god forms a foundation for their psychological well - being . \n thus , spirituality plays an important role in the lives of healthy individuals . in the result of our study \n a sense of god 's power over life and death and doing good deeds is the god 's will were derived from participants experience around spiritual beliefs . \n all the participants talked about the importance of god and belief to god 's power in their life . \n moreover , the findings reveal that god 's power was very important in personal and private experiences . in this regard , roff et al.(2009 ) in a qualitative study through a thematic content analysis identified god 's power in the lived experiences of women who were suffering from breast cancer . also , in another qualitative study by taleghani et al . \n ( 2006 ) belief to god 's will was a important key in acceptance of disease . \n 2002 ) suggested that personal variables such as the concept of god and perception of others beliefs played important mediating roles in religious coping with stress situations . \n religious practices were a subcategory that emerged from the lived experiences of elderly participants in this research . furthermore , the results of study by keefe et al . \n ( 2001 ) showed that individuals who reported frequent daily spiritual experiences had higher levels of positive mood , lower levels of daily negative mood , and higher levels of all of the social support domains . \n another subcategory that emerged from participants experience was going to mosque and religious ceremonies . in this regard , palinkas ( 1982 ) found that religious ceremonies are supportive for individuals because liberating and curative friendships relevant to spiritual states brings about psychological health for them . attending religious ceremonies and shrines also reduces individuals anxieties and sense of loneliness . \n these results are in accordance with our study findings which show that elderly women who participate in religious ceremonies , are relieved from loneliness . also koenig ( 1998 ) \n suggested that religious practices , attitudes and coping behaviors are prevalent among hospitalized medically ill older adults and are related to social , psychological and physical health outcomes . \n morris ( 1983 ) examined the relationship between anxiety and pilgrimage and found that people with religious devotion experienced significantly lower rates of anxiety disorder compared to the non - religious group . \n every muslim learns their prayers from a young age and prays five times a day . \n in addition , those who seek guidance from the holy quran and believe that it has power over every aspect of their lives , expect and welcome any eventualities in their lives ( quran , chapter balad , verse 4 ) . \n it seems that elderly people have more tendencies to religious and spiritual subjects than young people . \n koenig et al . ( 2004 ) in his study showed spirituality and religion as an important factor in their lives more often than younger ones . \n several experimental studies have been conducted that showed positive effects of prayer on the management of physical symptoms of illness . \n kwilecki ( 1986 ) assessed the effect of prayer on stress and anxiety and found that 42% of participants report that saying prayer can diminish the stress and anxiety . also salehi ( 2001 ) found that individuals who pray regularly , experienced significantly lower rates of anxiety disorder and depression , psychological balance and hopefulness , compared to the non - prayer group . \n azizi ( 1996 ) found that more than 90% of prayers attained psychological tranquility and relaxation after saying prayer . \n several studies noted moderately positive correlations between indicators of physical health and prayer activities . also several studies have shown that prayer can play an important role in the recovery of patients who suffer from cardiac disease , hiv , arthritis rheumatoid , and cva attack , cancer cases , treatment of addiction , and physical , mental and social well - being . \n furthermore , evidence suggests that patients with strong religious beliefs and high levels of religious activity experience lower levels of pain , have better immune function , lower death rates from cancer , fewer incidences of heart disease , lower blood pressure and levels of cholesterol , better health behaviors , and greater compliance with medical treatment . \n the practical relevance of this study may conduct future work to further explicate and clarify the linkages between spirituality and physical and mental health and life style . \n future empirical research and new methods of investigation such as concept analysis , grounded theory , and action research are needed to develop the new models of caring for management of this group . in the life style area , \n future research should focus on the effects of spirituality on elderly people lifestyle domains and on the development of valid and reliable instruments to measure these effects . \n it is important to conduct such research in different samples , such as unhealthy elderly people ( frail , ill , and sick elderly people ) . \n future empirical research and new methods of investigation such as concept analysis , grounded theory , and action research are needed to develop the new models of caring for management of this group . in the life style area , \n future research should focus on the effects of spirituality on elderly people lifestyle domains and on the development of valid and reliable instruments to measure these effects . \n it is important to conduct such research in different samples , such as unhealthy elderly people ( frail , ill , and sick elderly people ) . \n in summary , we found that elderly people describe several elements in their illustration of spirituality in healthcare settings . \n spiritual health , spiritual beliefs , and religious practice intentionality were the main components of concept of spirituality in this group experiences . \n also , the findings of this study made it clear that spirituality has a considerable effect on the health and life of iranian elderly people and is a major supportive resource for their physical and psychosocial health . \n it can reduce mental distress and induce inner peace and hopefulness . because of the significant influence of spirituality on all domains of health of elderly people , it is critically important that health care providers understand how spirituality can considerably influence elderly people throughout their life . \n these findings will assist health professionals such as nurses , physicians , and social workers to recognize the spiritual needs and value the role of spirituality in promoting health and well - being among elderly people from different religions and cultures worldwide .",
         "background : spirituality is recognized as a personally important matter to the elderly , and there are evidences of its impact on their health . \n the aim of this study was to explore the concept of spirituality from the perspectives of iranian healthy elderly individuals.materials and methods : a conventional qualitative content analysis of carried out with 21 healthy elderly people from both male and female genders were chosen using a purposive sampling method in tehran in 2010 - 2011 . \n data collection was done through semi structured interviews . \n a qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the participants experiences and perceptions on spirituality , using a central question  what characterizes the spirituality in the iranian healthy elderly people?results : the following categories emerged from the data analysis : ( 1 ) spiritual health , with four sub categories including saying prayer as a calming factor ; beneficence as a way to god ; loss of psychological and spiritual support ; faith as a way to happiness ; ( 2 ) spiritual beliefs , with three sub categories including seeking help from god in difficulties ; god 's power over life and death ; doing good deeds is the god 's will ; and ( 3 ) religious practice with three sub categories including saying prayer ; reading quran ; and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage.conclusions:in this study was found that spirituality was a fundamental element in elderly individuals lives that help them to adapt with daily living conditions .",

term storage containers ( ibp ; indian oil corporation limited , nasik , india ) . \n on the day of surgery , the tissue was transported from the cryobank to the hospital in a liquid nitrogen container . \n the vials containing frozen tissue were gradually thawed by rubbing them between the palms or keeping them at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes until the frozen medium inside the vial was liquefied . \n the lenticule was then transferred into a petri dish and washed twice with balanced salt solution for 5 minutes each to remove the cryoprotectant agents . \n a visumax fs laser was used to create a 7.5 mm diameter pocket at a depth of 160 m and 4 mm superior incision . \n the incision was opened with a seibel spatula and the plane of the pocket was dissected . \n the cryopreserved lenticule ( which was matched for the refractive error after correcting for back vertex distance ) was placed on the patient 's cornea with its center marked with gentian violet dye . \n the lenticule was held with 2 forceps and inserted into the pocket . after insertion , \n the lenticule was spread out , and the center was aligned with the pupillary center . \n a depth of 160 m was chosen for implantation in all patients due to uncertainty in refractive outcomes , the novelty of the nomograms , and so the surgeon could have adequate tissue in the cap for later enhancement with surface ablation if required . \n postoperatively , a topical steroid ( 1% prednisolone acetate ; allergan , irvine , ca ) was prescribed for 3 months in a tapering dosage . \n in addition , 5% hypertonic saline drops ( hypersol-5 ; jawa pharmaceuticals , india ) were prescribed 6 times per day for 1 week to reduce endothelial stress and to aid in lenticule clearing . \n patients were examined postoperatively on days 1 and 15 and at 1 , 3 , and 6 months . \n a slit - lamp examination was performed to check for lenticule clarity , position , and wound healing . \n postoperative corneal haze and folds were graded at every follow - up time point using the scale described by nakamura et al and the corneal folds grading atlas.12,13 on postoperative day 15 and onward , the following assessments were performed : uncorrected visual acuity , best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) , retinoscopy for residual refractive error , topography using orbscan(bausch & lomb - technolas , munchen , germany ) and sirius ( schwind eye - tech solutions , kleinostheim , germany ) , anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( optovue , fremont , ca ) , clinical photography , specular microscopy ( tomey , japan ) , dry eye assessment ( schirmer 's i ) , and aberrometry ( itrace ; tracey technologies , houston , tx ) . \n table 2 provides the details of donors and lenticules used for fili in the 9 eyes treated . \n demographic details of patients who underwent fili ( 7 patients , 9 eyes ) details of donors and lenticules used for fili ( n = 9 ) on day 1 , in the first 2 consecutive eyes , the implanted lenticules had mild to moderate descemet membrane folds that resolved spontaneously within 1 week . \n subsequently , the treated eyes were prescribed hypertonic saline drops , which showed clear lenticules within 48 hours and until the last follow - up time point . \n figure 2 shows serial clinical photographs and anterior segment optical coherence tomography of the eye treated with fili at day 15 and at 6 months post - fili showing clear lenticules with good centration . \n a , serial digital clinical photographs ( 16 ) of 32-year - old woman operated for + 6.5 d hyperopia in the right eye with fili . \n distance from edge of the lenticule to limbus was measured at 3 points and verified at every visit to check for centering and any shift in position . \n b , six - month postoperative anterior segment optical coherence tomography of an eye treated for + 6.5 d hyperopia showing a clear and well - centered lenticule . \n all eyes had an uncorrected visual acuity equal to or better than the preoperative bcva . \n the refractive predictability for hyperopia was fairly accurate , and all eyes had a residual spherical equivalent within 1.0 diopter ( d ) , although in the aphakic eye , the residual spherical equivalent was + 4.1 d. there was an average of 0.75 to 1.00 d against - the - rule astigmatism in all eyes due to the superior 4 mm incision , which reduced and stabilized over time . \n postoperative results of eyes treated with fili ( n = 9 ) table 4 provides changes in anterior and posterior curvature , pachymetry and asphericity ( q value ) following fili . \n all eyes had central corneal steepening with a mean change in anterior keratometry of 3.5 d in the central 3-mm zone . \n there was an average 0.33 d flattening of posterior corneal curvature in all eyes , which was seen more in thicker lenticules compared with the thinner ones . \n figure 3 illustrates changes in anterior and posterior curvature post - fili in an eye , over time . \n changes in anterior and posterior topography , pachymetry , and asphericity post - fili ( n = 9 ) orbscan anterior corneal surface topography ( top ) and sirius posterior elevation ( bottom ) over the 6-month postoperative course after fili for eye with + 6.5 d hyperopia . \n the postoperative q values in all eyes became more negative , suggesting a hyperprolate shift . \n table 5 provides analysis of the epithelial thickness profile , which suggested mild epithelial thinning in the 5-mm zone in all hyperopic eyes , except for the aphakic eye , which showed mild epithelial thickening in the corresponding zone . \n figure 4 illustrates the epithelial thickness map of an eye treated with fili at 6 months . \n epithelial thickness profile on anterior segment optical coherence tomography in the central 5-mm zone epithelial thickness profile with anterior segment optical coherence tomography of an eye 6 months post - fili for + 6.5 d hyperopia . \n higher order aberrations ( hoa ) did not show a significant increase in root mean square values postoperatively in the 8 hyperopic eyes ( p > 0.05 ) . \n endothelial cell count and schirmer i test scores were normal and the changes were not significant at the last follow - up ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 6 ) . \n total hoas at 5-mm pupil size ( n = 8) , ecd , and schirmer 's i scores , pre- and post - fili ( n = 9 ) \n the potential advantages of cryopreservation of refractive lenticules have been largely described for use in the same patient , in the event of future ectasia or presbyopia by restoring corneal volume.3 with the increasing number of eyes undergoing relex smile for myopia , and thus , the extracted lenticules as a by - product , it may be a novel idea to preserve these lenticules on a long - term basis using cryopreservation for potential future use and research . \n following establishment of one such tissue bank , we wanted to explore the possibility of use of such cryopreserved refractive lenticules for potential treatment of hyperopia and study the feasibility , safety , efficacy , and reproducibility of this new treatment . \n initially , the amblyopic eyes were studied mainly for changes in refraction and topography following tissue addition . \n there was also the goal of evaluating any loss of bcva and complications , such as haze and tissue rejection . \n even these patients benefited from the surgery , as their refractive error was corrected to their best spectacle - corrected visual acuity and reduced their dependence on eyeglasses . after reviewing the results for 6 months , the indications were extended to normal eyes and bilateral surgery . \n unlike myopia , the correction of hyperopia involves creation of a furrow - like ring zone in the paracentral zone of the cornea . \n both photorefractive keratectomy and lasik are subtractive procedures that steepen the cornea by ablating the midperipheral tissue.14,15 this creates an abnormal hyperprolate shape of the cornea that is associated with significant regression , especially in higher degrees of refractive errors.16 it potentially leads to the induction of hoas like coma and spherical aberrations and loss of bcva.17 fili is an innovative technique based on barraquer 's law of thickness,18 whereby the cornea is made steeper by addition of a lenticule of known thickness and power into a pocket created in a patient 's cornea using the fs laser . \n the concept is similar to epikeratophakia , used to treat aphakia in the past , which had its own disadvantages.19 a fs laser overcomes these problems by creating precise lenticules and incisions at an accurate depth . the lenticular tissue processing technique described by mohamed - noriega et al10 \n was modified in this study by replacing bovine serum albumin with human tissue culture media to eliminate the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases or unexpected adverse reactions due to bovine serum . \n the protocols of gradual staged thawing , which are essential for the whole cornea to prevent endothelial cell injury due to sudden thawing , were not strictly followed in this study . \n microbiological and cellular cultures were not deemed necessary , as the tissue processing and preservation were conducted under strict sterile conditions , and the tissue did not contain vital endothelial cells . also , previous studies have suggested that stromal keratocytes within the extracted lenticules remain viable and can be stimulated to proliferate in appropriate cell culture conditions , even after a prolonged period of cryopreservation.9,10 the change in asphericity after fili suggests an increase in the prolateness of the cornea , which is expected after tissue addition , although the observed change was not seen as much as it is after hyperopic lasik.20 the shape of the cornea is more natural after tissue addition compared with tissue subtraction , which does not lead to significant induction of hoas.21 the total hoas after fili remain within normal acceptable values and may be better than hyperopic lasik / photorefractive keratectomy.22,23 also , tissue addition may be more forgiving for mild decentration , which is not the case with hyperopic lasik \n . the rate of enhancement following hyperopic lasik can be up to 10% or more,24 especially in younger patients . \n after tissue addition , significant changes in topography or regression are not expected ; thus , retreatment rates may be lower . \n epithelial thickness profile is more favorable , which , unlike hyperopic lasik , does not cause midperipheral epithelial hyperplasia to compensate for loss of stromal tissue , hence reducing chances of regression.25 problems of haze and flap - related issues like delayed healing , infection , and dislocation are eliminated , thereby leading to greater patient comfort and faster recovery . \n a fairly good refractive predictability was observed with this technique in the treatment of moderate hyperopia , although results were not highly accurate for correcting very high hyperopia ( eg , aphakia ) . in a case study reported by pradhan \n et al,4 a 10 d lenticule was implanted to achieve correction of aphakia but had a high residual refraction of + 5 d. there are possible explanations for this result . \n first , the technique of pradhan et al of pocket creation was different from the technique used in this study . in the said study , \n a smile lenticule was first created , followed by dissection of the anterior plane to create a pocket , thus making 2 planes that could possibly cause weakening of the cornea . \n second , the optical zone of the lenticule in the study of pradhan et al was 5.7 mm compared with 6 mm in the current aphakia case , causing comparatively less volume of tissue addition . \n the correction is expected to be relatively higher in larger lenticules because there is more volume of the tissue added . in this hyperopic series , \n the lenticule size ranged from 6.3 to 6.8 mm . also , the posterior curvature changes as described in the case study of pradhan et al reduced the effect on anterior curvature . \n this was also probably the cause of the high + 4.1 d residual refraction in the current study . \n after compensation , implantation of lenticule of approximately 12.5 d is required , and this is currently not possible with visumax . \n the biomechanics of corneas in these patients were not studied due to lack of equipment such as the corvis ( oculus optikgerte gmbh , wetzlar , germany ) . however , because most of the bowman layer is preserved and tissue is being added , it is assumed that the biomechanics are more stable than lasik , where a flap is cut and tissue is subtracted from the periphery.26 the procedure certainly amounts to corneal transplantation and thus , theoretically carries the risk of future rejection . \n however , unlike traditional full thickness grafts , which have a graft  host junction proximal to host limbus , in this technique , the lenticule was well protected in the host corneal pocket and did not come in direct contact with the host 's limbal vasculature and immune system , making the risk of allogeneic graft rejection remotely possible.27 also , the lenticule was mainly stromal collagen tissue ; the incidence of rejection is significantly low in such a scenario compared with endothelial rejection . \n because no sutures are applied , there are no suture - related complications such as loosening , vascularization , or infection that would potentially trigger graft rejection.28 nevertheless , there is a need to monitor for signs of rejection and treat it like allogeneic graft rejection should rejection occur . \n because it is a reversible procedure , the lenticule can always be explanted in the event of any adverse effects or rejection in future . \n the preliminary results of fili in hyperopia indicate that this may be a better technique than hyperopic lasik for moderate hyperopia in terms of stability , regression , aberrations , and postoperative dry eye . \n although it is a bit early to exactly predict the refractive outcomes , initial data indicate that the cryopreservation technique used is safe in heterologous individuals . \n further studies with a larger cohort and modification of the surgical technique with a goal of reducing postoperative astigmatism and refining nomograms are suggested to determine the long - term safety and refractive effects on the cornea and establish the technique as a valid option to treat hyperopia .",
         "purpose : to describe the technique of cryopreservation of corneal lenticules extracted after small incision refractive lenticule extraction ( relex smile ) and initial results of femtosecond laser intrastromal lenticular implantation for hyperopia.methods:lenticules were collected from patients undergoing relex smile for the correction of myopia and subjected to a tissue processing technique and cryopreservation . \n these lenticules were subsequently used to treat 8 hyperopic eyes and 1 aphakic eye . \n a femtosecond laser was used to create a pocket into each patient 's cornea , followed by implantation of a cryopreserved lenticule . \n the patients were monitored through follow - up examinations for a mean 155.4 days ( 38310 days).results : the mean interval from storage of lenticules to removal from liquid nitrogen was 96 days ( range , 19178 days ) . \n mean spherical equivalent of hyperopic eyes treated was + 4.50  1.1 diopter ( d ) . \n mean keratometry and pachymetry changed from preoperative 43.9 d and 531.6 m to 47.4 d and 605.2 m , respectively , postoperatively . \n mean residual spherical equivalent for hyperopic eyes was + 0.6 d and + 4.1 d for the aphakic eye . \n none of the eyes showed evidence of rejection or loss of best - corrected visual acuity at the end of the follow - up period.conclusions:the cryopreservation technique seems to be a safe method of long - term storage of refractive lenticules extracted after relex smile for use in allogeneic human subjects . \n it may potentially be a safe and effective alternative to excimer laser ablation for hyperopia because of the low risks of regression , haze , flap - related complications , postoperative dry eye , and higher - order aberrations.clinical trial registration \n url : http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . \n unique identifier : ctri/2014/01/004331 .",

cyclists . \n the cyclists initiated all tt in the heat with a similar power output as maintained during the first 20% of ttc . \n however , while maintaining similar hr , they subsequently experienced a marked decrease in power output and speed in the heat . \n these decrements were progressively restored with heat acclimatization , despite core temperature in all tt in the heat increasing significantly more than that in cool conditions . \n our data showed that mean power output during tth-1 decreased by 16%  5% in unacclimatized cyclists . \n this decrement in power output for an increase in air temperature of approximately 28c between ttc and tth-1 represents an average decrement in performance of 0.5% per 1c increase . even if this decrement is not linear , as the effect of an absolute increase in air temperature is more important in warm than in cold environments ( 13 ) , this rate is comparable with the decrements reported during laboratory tt ( 0.3% to 0.9% per 1c ( 12,23,24,32 ) . \n in addition , the current study quantified the effects of heat stress on performance at different acclimatization stages . to date , most studies investigating the effects of heat on performance have examined unacclimatized participants . \n these have shown that artificial heat acclimatization increases the ability to cycle in a hot laboratory ( 18,21 ) and that natural heat acclimatization increases physical performance during sporting activities in hot environments ( 25,26,33 ) . \n however , a comparison of the magnitude of improvement in performance after heat acclimatization , relative to the initial decrement in performance associated with the first exposure to heat stress , has yet to be examined . \n our data showed that the decrement in cycling performance was progressively restored as the cyclists acclimatized . from an average power decrement of 16%  5% on the first day of heat exposure ( tth-1 ) \n relative to ttc , the decrement was reduced to 8%  4% after 1 wk of training in the heat ( tth-2 ) and to 3%  4% after 2 wk ( tth-3 ) . despite the cooling effect of air movement \n , our data showed that the average final temperature of the riders was above 40c during tth , irrespective of heat acclimatization ( table 1 ) . \n one rider complained of nausea after tth-1 but did not require medical attention and participated in the following training sessions and tests without any sequelae . despite an average final temperature of 40.2c ( range , 39.6c41.0c ) , \n this confirms that well - prepared athletes reach high core temperatures while exercising in the heat , asymptomatic of heat illness ( 4 ) , and that there is no absolute critical temperature threshold set at 40c ( 11 ) . in the current study , despite the decrease in power output ( fig . \n 1 ) and the possibility to drink ad libitum on the bike , participants lost more than 2% body mass and core temperature reached final values above 40c in the hot conditions ( fig . \n our data showed a decrement in absolute intensity ( i.e. , power output ) during the tt but the likely maintenance of a similar relative intensity . \n indeed , it has been shown that the rise in cardiovascular strain in hot conditions during both constant rate ( 1,36,37 ) and self - paced ( 24 ) exercise mediates a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity , resulting in an increase in relative intensity for a given absolute work rate . \n although power output decreases during prolonged self - paced exercise in the heat , it is proposed that a similar relative intensity to that of cool conditions is maintained and is reflected by a similar or slightly elevated hr ( 24 ) . \n it therefore seems that despite a decrease in power output , hr remained elevated and stable ( fig . \n moreover , the pacing pattern was not dependent on the environmental conditions or the acclimatization level , which is in line with recent reports that pacing strategies are not affected by environmental temperature ( 23 ) , thermal perception ( 2 ) , or the presence of previous muscle fatigue ( 6 ) . \n rather , it seems that pacing during a cycling tt in hot or temperate conditions relates to the maintenance of a physiological threshold or relative intensity ( manifested by hr ) . \n given the progressive reduction in vo2max as hyperthermia develops , sustainable power output is reduced , owing to a reduction in work rate for a given relative exercise intensity ( 24 ) . furthermore , it is remarkable that experienced cyclists started their tt at the same absolute intensity regardless of the environmental conditions or their level of heat acclimatization . \n notwithstanding , it has previously been reported that tt are initiated at the same power output in hot and cool conditions ( 11,24,31 ) . \n this similar work rate adopted seems to correspond to a critical power ( 16 ) . \n given that vo2max does not typically decrease in the first approximately 15 min of exercise in the heat ( 27,29,35 ) , athletes seem to adopt a relative intensity associated with this critical power output . as vo2max progressively decreases with the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain in the heat , the maintenance of a similar relative intensity requires reduction in power output ( 24 ) . \n however , given the role of previous experiences on pacing ( 30 ) , one would expect that the large decrease in power output experienced by the athletes during tth-1 would have led to a conservative start during tth-2 . \n initial power output was similar between trials and decreased thereafter in relation to acclimatization state . \n indeed , early studies suggest that heat acclimatization attenuates the circulatory strain associated with thermoregulation ( 19 ) , allowing normalization of the relation between physiological responses and work intensity ( 10 ) . \n consequently , the cyclists seem to have finished all tt at a similar relative intensity , as suggested by hr and the similar core temperatures recorded upon completion but at a higher power output as acclimatization progressed . of note , the slightly higher hr in tth may be attributable to higher skin blood flow , as suggested by the higher core temperature , although the cyclists were wearing thermal clothing in ttc , which would also have lead to increase in skin temperature and blood flow . \n the current study is the first to investigate cycling performance during outdoor tt in a hot environment . \n . however , the evaporative capacity of the environment is improved with higher air velocities , reducing heat stress and dehydration during outdoor cycling compared with indoor laboratory - based experiments ( 28 ) . in the current study , \n the cyclists wore thermal clothing in ttc including long tights , long sleeves , and gloves , which limited the evaporative and convective power of the environment , whereas they wore short tights and a jersey with short sleeves in the heat ( except one cyclist who was consistently using white long sleeves ) . \n therefore , it can not be ruled out that overall performance may be optimized in a slightly warmer temperature than in the ttc conditions of the current study . \n interestingly , the detrimental effect of hot ambient conditions on speed was not as important as that on power output ( table 1 ) . \n the different relations between the environment and speed and power output could be partly related to a temperature effect on air density , as the aerodynamic drag of a cyclist is related to air density and temperature ( 3,9,17 ) . for example , at an air temperature of 11c , the temperature reported to optimize laboratory cycling capacity ( 14 ) , air density is approximately 1.245 kgm at sea level . \n in contrast , air density drops to approximately 1.165 kgm at a temperature of 30c , reducing the drag force by approximately 6% . \n consequently , the decrease in air density noted in hot ambient conditions is likely to partially attenuate the performance decrement associated with development of hyperthermia during outdoor cycling . in the current study , \n air density was 9.4% lower during tth-3 ( 1.131 kgm ) than that during ttc ( 1.249 kgm ) , representing a power economy of almost 8% ( 22 ) . \n thus , despite the slightly lower power output in tth-3 than that in ttc ( 3% ) , the average speeds were not significantly different . \n our data showed that mean power output during tth-1 decreased by 16%  5% in unacclimatized cyclists . \n this decrement in power output

laboratory ( 18,21 ) and that natural heat acclimatization increases physical performance during sporting activities in hot environments ( 25,26,33 ) . \n however , a comparison of the magnitude of improvement in performance after heat acclimatization , relative to the initial decrement in performance associated with the first exposure to heat stress , has yet to be examined . \n our data showed that the decrement in cycling performance was progressively restored as the cyclists acclimatized . from an average power decrement of 16%  5% on the first day of heat exposure ( tth-1 ) \n relative to ttc , the decrement was reduced to 8%  4% after 1 wk of training in the heat ( tth-2 ) and to 3%  4% after 2 wk ( tth-3 ) . despite the cooling effect of air movement \n , our data showed that the average final temperature of the riders was above 40c during tth , irrespective of heat acclimatization ( table 1 ) . \n one rider complained of nausea after tth-1 but did not require medical attention and participated in the following training sessions and tests without any sequelae . despite an average final temperature of 40.2c ( range , 39.6c41.0c ) , \n this confirms that well - prepared athletes reach high core temperatures while exercising in the heat , asymptomatic of heat illness ( 4 ) , and that there is no absolute critical temperature threshold set at 40c ( 11 ) . in the current study , despite the decrease in power output ( fig . \n 1 ) and the possibility to drink ad libitum on the bike , participants lost more than 2% body mass and core temperature reached final values above 40c in the hot conditions ( fig . \n our data showed a decrement in absolute intensity ( i.e. , power output ) during the tt but the likely maintenance of a similar relative intensity . \n indeed , it has been shown that the rise in cardiovascular strain in hot conditions during both constant rate ( 1,36,37 ) and self - paced ( 24 ) exercise mediates a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity , resulting in an increase in relative intensity for a given absolute work rate . \n although power output decreases during prolonged self - paced exercise in the heat , it is proposed that a similar relative intensity to that of cool conditions is maintained and is reflected by a similar or slightly elevated hr ( 24 ) . \n it therefore seems that despite a decrease in power output , hr remained elevated and stable ( fig . \n moreover , the pacing pattern was not dependent on the environmental conditions or the acclimatization level , which is in line with recent reports that pacing strategies are not affected by environmental temperature ( 23 ) , thermal perception ( 2 ) , or the presence of previous muscle fatigue ( 6 ) . \n rather , it seems that pacing during a cycling tt in hot or temperate conditions relates to the maintenance of a physiological threshold or relative intensity ( manifested by hr ) . \n given the progressive reduction in vo2max as hyperthermia develops , sustainable power output is reduced , owing to a reduction in work rate for a given relative exercise intensity ( 24 ) . furthermore , it is remarkable that experienced cyclists started their tt at the same absolute intensity regardless of the environmental conditions or their level of heat acclimatization . \n notwithstanding , it has previously been reported that tt are initiated at the same power output in hot and cool conditions ( 11,24,31 ) . \n this similar work rate adopted seems to correspond to a critical power ( 16 ) . \n given that vo2max does not typically decrease in the first approximately 15 min of exercise in the heat ( 27,29,35 ) , athletes seem to adopt a relative intensity associated with this critical power output . as vo2max progressively decreases with the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain in the heat , the maintenance of a similar relative intensity requires reduction in power output ( 24 ) . \n however , given the role of previous experiences on pacing ( 30 ) , one would expect that the large decrease in power output experienced by the athletes during tth-1 would have led to a conservative start during tth-2 . \n initial power output was similar between trials and decreased thereafter in relation to acclimatization state . \n indeed , early studies suggest that heat acclimatization attenuates the circulatory strain associated with thermoregulation ( 19 ) , allowing normalization of the relation between physiological responses and work intensity ( 10 ) . \n consequently , the cyclists seem to have finished all tt at a similar relative intensity , as suggested by hr and the similar core temperatures recorded upon completion but at a higher power output as acclimatization progressed . of note , the slightly higher hr in tth may be attributable to higher skin blood flow , as suggested by the higher core temperature , although the cyclists were wearing thermal clothing in ttc , which would also have lead to increase in skin temperature and blood flow . \n the current study is the first to investigate cycling performance during outdoor tt in a hot environment . \n however , the evaporative capacity of the environment is improved with higher air velocities , reducing heat stress and dehydration during outdoor cycling compared with indoor laboratory - based experiments ( 28 ) . in the current study , \n the cyclists wore thermal clothing in ttc including long tights , long sleeves , and gloves , which limited the evaporative and convective power of the environment , whereas they wore short tights and a jersey with short sleeves in the heat ( except one cyclist who was consistently using white long sleeves ) . \n therefore , it can not be ruled out that overall performance may be optimized in a slightly warmer temperature than in the ttc conditions of the current study . \n interestingly , the detrimental effect of hot ambient conditions on speed was not as important as that on power output ( table 1 ) . \n the different relations between the environment and speed and power output could be partly related to a temperature effect on air density , as the aerodynamic drag of a cyclist is related to air density and temperature ( 3,9,17 ) . for example , at an air temperature of 11c , the temperature reported to optimize laboratory cycling capacity ( 14 ) , air density is approximately 1.245 kgm at sea level . \n in contrast , air density drops to approximately 1.165 kgm at a temperature of 30c , reducing the drag force by approximately 6% . \n consequently , the decrease in air density noted in hot ambient conditions is likely to partially attenuate the performance decrement associated with development of hyperthermia during outdoor cycling . in the current study , \n air density was 9.4% lower during tth-3 ( 1.131 kgm ) than that during ttc ( 1.249 kgm ) , representing a power economy of almost 8% ( 22 ) . \n thus , despite the slightly lower power output in tth-3 than that in ttc ( 3% ) , the average speeds were not significantly different . \n the novel findings of this investigation are that competitive cyclists performing an outdoor tt undertake their effort at the same power output , irrespective of the environmental conditions or previous experience . \n consequently , non  heat - acclimatized cyclists are incapable of sustaining this absolute effort . \n however , the decrement in power output is partly recovered after 1 wk of heat acclimatization and almost fully restored after 2 wk . \n furthermore , our data seem to confirm that sustainable power output is related to a given relative intensity ( 24 ) , which is partly reflected in the maintenance of hr within a certain range . finally , because of the reduction in air density associated with cycling in hot ambient conditions , speed was not different between tth-3 and ttc .",
         "abstractpurposethis study aimed to determine the effects of heat acclimatization on performance and pacing during outdoor cycling time trials ( tt , 43.4 km ) in the heat.methodsnine cyclists performed three tt in hot ambient conditions ( tth , approximately 37c ) on the first ( tth-1 ) , sixth ( tth-2 ) , and 14th ( tth-3 ) days of training in the heat . data were compared with the average of two tt in cool condition ( approximately 8c ) performed before and after heat acclimatization ( ttc).resultstth-1 ( 77  6 min ) was slower ( p = 0.001 ) than tth-2 ( 69  5 min ) , and both were slower ( p < 0.01 ) than ttc and tth-3 ( 66  3 and 66  4 min , respectively ) , without differences between ttc and tth-3 ( p > 0.05 ) . \n the cyclists initiated the first 20% of all tt at a similar power output , irrespective of climate and acclimatization status ; however , during tth-1 , they subsequently had a marked decrease in power output , which was partly attenuated after 6 d of acclimatization and was further reduced after 14 d. hr was higher during the first 20% of tth-1 than that in the other tt ( p < 0.05 ) , but there were no differences between conditions from 30% onward . \n final rectal temperature was similar in all tth ( 40.2c  0.4c , p = 1.000 ) and higher than that in ttc ( 38.5c  0.6c , p < 0.001).conclusionsafter 2 wk of acclimatization , trained cyclists are capable of completing a prolonged tt in a similar time in the heat compared with cool conditions , whereas in the unacclimatized state , they experienced a marked decrease in power output during the tth .",

         "worksites in glass and metal works , foundries , rolling mills , in the vicinity of hardening furnaces , rotary kilns in the cement industry , high - temperature laboratory furnaces , as well as firefighting , are associated , in addition to common mechanical hazards ( e.g. , due to splashes of molten metals and slag ) , sparks and direct contact with open fires , with hazards caused by emission of harmful optic radiation within the visible ( vis ) and infrared ( ir ) spectrum range . \n excessive exposure to ir radiation leads to dryness of the mucous membranes , burns of the eyeball and development of cataracts . \n protection against thermal hazards due to excessive amounts of ir radiation reaching the eyes is provided by protective optic filters installed in spectacles , goggles or face protections . besides protecting the user against hazardous ir radiation \n , such filters should ensure that the object / area of work can be seen clearly . if the level of ir radiation is very high , \n the use of filters reflecting radiation is recommended , as it allows the temperature increase in the filter itself to be reduced . \n the filters currently used for the protection of the face and eyes against hazardous ir radiation are of metallic reflective type , made of glass or organic material ( mainly polycarbonate ) bases coated with a single metallic layer for reflectance of ir radiation or absorption filters . \n absorption filters are manufactured from dyed glass obtained in a mass staining process by introduction of a factor modifying the radiation within the vis and near infrared ( nir ) spectrum range passing through the filter . \n the effect of a protective optical filter obtained as a result of this process is based on absorption of a large proportion of optic radiation , whereas only a small proportion of radiation the filter is exposed to is reflected . \n this is an undesirable phenomenon , contributing to deterioration of the filter user 's comfort . \n reflective metallic filters are obtained by deposition of a metallic layer of copper ( cu ) or gold ( au ) on mineral or organic bases . \n such filters take advantage of the characteristic properties of the metals used in their production , i.e. , significant reflection coefficient for ir radiation and significant transmittance for the vis spectrum . despite the fact that the technique of deposition of interference layers has been known for many years   the application of thin film ir filters in eye protections to block \n the previous papers published by the authors of this study   contain descriptions of the structure of interference filters designed for application in eye protections \n highly effective in reduction of ir radiation with high level of transmission of the vis spectrum . \n the authors investigated also the optical and mechanical parameters of the newly developed protective optic filters manufactured with the use of interference technologies . \n the analysis of the results of the conducted tests demonstrated numerous advantages of interference technology application in the construction of protective filters , including : improved resistance to damage of the external protective filter surface ( cracking , scratching etc . ) as well as high reflection coefficients for the nir spectrum . \n the aim of the present study was to compare the optic properties of protective filters manufactured by taking advantage of the interference technology and those coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation . \n the coefficients characterizing their optic parameters , allowing to assess the protective properties within the vis and ir spectrum range were compared . \n the following coefficients were analysed : \n luminous transmittance (  \n v),ir transmittance within the 7801400  nm range (  \n a),ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range (  \n n),ir reflectance within the 7802000  nm range ( r \n n),ir absorptance within the 7802000  nm range ( a \n n),shade number ( n ) . \n luminous transmittance (  \n v ) , ir transmittance within the 7801400  nm range (  \n a ) , ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range (  \n n ) , ir reflectance within the 7802000  nm range ( r \n n ) , ir absorptance within the 7802000  nm range ( a \n n ) , the level of protection ( shade number ) is determined on the basis of luminous transmittance ( the higher protection level correlates with the higher level of ir radiation blocked and appropriately lower vis light transmittance ) . \n protection level consists of a code number ( e.g. , 4 ) for ir filters and a shade number ( e.g. , 3 , 5 , 7 ) calculated according to the following equation : \n ( 1 ) \n where  \n v \n =  luminous transmittance . for the particular level of protection , the mean ir transmittance within the 7801400 and 7802000  nm ranges as well as the ir reflectance and absorptance within the 7802000  nm range are determined . \n for comparative analysis of the metallic reflective filters available in the market versus the interference filters developed by the authors , the following samples were prepared for the tests : \n off the shelf metallic reflective filters on a polycarbonate base ( flat parallel plate of 50  mm diameter and 2  mm thickness with a metallic layer of copper ( cu )  protection levels : 4 - 3 , 4 - 5

silicon dioxide ) . \n  off the shelf metallic reflective filters on a polycarbonate base ( flat parallel plate of 50  mm diameter and 2  mm thickness with a metallic layer of copper ( cu )

optical properties of the filters were measured with a cary 5000 spectrophotometer ( varian , australia ) . the spectrophotometer enabled transmittance or reflectance of optical radiation within the vis and nir spectrum to be recorded with 1  nm steps and 0.001% resolution level . \n spectral transmittance and reflectance measurements were carried out within the wavelength range of 7802000  nm . \n the quartz halogen lamp was used as a source of radiation . to detect transmitted or reflected radiation \n the photomultiplier tube and lead sulphide detector were used for vis and nir spectrum , respectively . \n spectral transmittance was measured with incident radiation falling normally on the filter surface in the visual centre ( defined as in ) . for spectral reflectance \n the measurements were taken every second owing to the high absorption of investigated filters within the nir region . \n since the minimum averaging time of the cary 5000 spectrophotometer was 0.0125  s , the values of transmittance or reflectance were measured 125 times for a given wavelength . \n the aforementioned coefficients were calculated from the following equations [ 1012 ] : \n luminous

. exposure to an excessive amount of radiation from this range \n can result in burns of the retina and , in extreme cases , its permanent damage . \n , chronic long - term exposure may lead to the development of cataracts , referred to as ir or glass worker 's cataracts . in view of the above \n the results presented on the graphs in figure 1 and the determined transmittance values ( see table 2 ) indicate unequivocally more effective blocking of ir radiation provided by interference filters . \n the values of  \n a and  \n n for interference filters are lower even by an order of magnitude than those obtained for the metallic reflective filters . \n for instance , the mean value of ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range for interference filters with protection level 4 - 5 ( one of the most common protection levels used in the metallurgic industry ) equals 0.006% and is significantly lower than the maximum acceptable value specified in , which is 10.6% . \n for all the investigated filters , the values of r \n n exceed 60% , which classifies them in the group of filters with increased ir reflectance . \n the levels of the ir absorptance for metallic reflective filters and interference filters of 4 - 3 and 4 - 5 protection class are similar . for the highest of the investigated protection levels  4 - 7 \n the above findings are important for selection of a filter appropriate for the radiation source . \n the selection of filter protection level is dependent on the temperature of the radiation source . \n the 4 - 7 level is used for radiation sources whose temperature exceeds 1600  k ( e.g. , occurs in the metallurgical industry ) . with such high temperatures , \n reduction of filter heating as a result of exposure to ir radiation is important . as it follows from comparative analysis of the optic properties of filters taking advantage of the interference technology and filters coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation \n , the interference filters provide a more effective blocking of ir radiation in comparison with the currently used protective filters . \n ",
         "the paper analyses the selected optical parameters of protective optic filters used for protection of the eyes against hazardous radiation within the visible ( vis ) and near infrared ( nir ) spectrum range . \n the indexes characterizing transmission and reflection of optic radiation incident on the filter are compared . \n as it follows from the completed analysis , the newly developed interference filters provide more effective blocking of infrared radiation in comparison with the currently used protective filters .",

         "endotracheal intubation is one of the most important skills for anesthesiologists in securing the airway during general anesthesia and resuscitation . \n failure to secure the airway can cause anesthesia - related life - threatening morbidity and mortality . \n however , the difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation rate still remains at 1.513% due to poor reliability of traditional protocols , algorithms , and combinations of screening tools in identifying a potentially difficult airway . \n due to the portable , noninvasive characteristics , point - of - care ultrasound ( us ) technique has been widely used in the operating room for ultrasound - guided nerve block , central venous access , and pneumothorax diagnosis . with improved visualization of airway structures , \n prasad et al . first found that us can reliably image all of the structures visualized by ct , and the infrahyoid airway structure parameters measured by ultrasound agree well with the parameters measured by ct . \n adhikari et al . further demonstrated that the anterior neck soft tissue thickness measured by ultrasound at hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an index to predict difficult laryngoscopy , but only the anterior neck soft tissue thickness at thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy . \n interestingly , they did not find a correlation between us measurements and clinical screening tests . \n .   also found that an abundance of fat tissue at the anterior neck region as detected by ultrasound in israeli obesity patients was a very good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy , being a much better predictor than body mass index ( bmi ) per se . \n however , a similar study in the unites states showed that us quantification of anterior soft tissue and general bedside screening tests failed to predict difficult laryngoscopy in american obese patients , suggesting that racial or body shape differences might exist . to define the role of airway us in predicting difficult laryngoscopy \n , we evaluated the feasibility of ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population . \n after approval of the research protocol by the local hospital ethics committee for human studies and obtaining personal informed consent , 203 american society of anesthesiologists ( asa ) grade i and ii adult patients undergoing elective surgeries and receiving general anesthesia were included in this study . \n exclusion criteria included patients who had facial , cervical , pharyngeal and epiglottis surgical or trauma history , patients with most teeth lost , and patients with arthritis . \n the modified mallampati score ( mms ) was specified according to the visibility of pharyngeal structures with the patient in an upright sitting position , head in neutral position , mouth wide open , and tongue protruding to its maximum without phonation ( figure 1a ) . \n class i is visualization of the hard palate , soft palate , fauces , uvula , and pillars . \n class ii is visualization of the hard palate , soft palate , fauces , and base of uvula . \n thyromental distance ( tmd ) was measured from the mental prominence to the thyroid cartilage with the patient s neck extended fully . \n interincisor gap ( iig ) was measured from the upper central incisors to the lower central incisors while the patient s mouth was fully opened . \n ultrasound measurements were performed by the primary investigator with the patient supine and the head and neck in neutral position . \n the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue at hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels were obtained transversely across the anterior surface of the neck with a 136 mhz hfl38 linear array ultrasound probe attached to a sonosite s - nerve machine ( sonosite inc . , \n the minimal distance from the hyoid bone to skin surface ( dshb ) was measured ( figure 2a , 2b ) . at thyrohyoid membrane level , \n the distance from skin to epiglottis midway ( dsem ) between the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage was measured ( figure 2c , 2d ) . at anterior commissure level , \n the minimal distance from skin to anterior commissure ( dsac ) was obtained ( figure 2e , 2f ) . \n after anesthesia induction with midazolam 0.04 mg / kg , propofol 22.5 mg / kg , fentanyl 24 g / kg , and succinylcholine 2 mg / kg , endotracheal intubation was carried out by anesthesia providers with a minimum of 2 years of endotracheal intubation experience . \n the macintosh blades were used to expose the target larynx , and no external laryngeal pressure was used to facilitate this process . \n classification of laryngoscopic views was based on the method described by cormack and lehane ( figure 1b ) . \n continuous data are expressed as means ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) ; categorical data are expressed as numbers of occurrences ( percents ) . \n comparison analysis was performed using the t - test for continuous variables and chi - square or fisher exact tests , as appropriate , for non - continuous variables . \n the best fit lines of dshb , dsem , dsac , mms , iig , and tmd were determined using a least - squares regression technique . \n receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analyses were used to calculate the comparable threshold values of dshb , dsem , dsac , tmd , iig , and mms . \n optimal cutoff values were calculated using the youden index ( calculated as : sensitivity + specificity  100 ) . \n statistical analyses were performed using medcalc for windows , version 12.6.1.0 ( medcalc software , ostend , belgium ) . \n the level of statistical significance was p<0.05 , and p<0.0001 was considered to be very statistically significant . \n continuous data are expressed as means ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) ; categorical data are expressed as numbers of occurrences ( percents ) . \n comparison analysis was performed using the t - test for continuous variables and chi - square or fisher exact tests , as appropriate , for non - continuous variables . \n the best fit lines of dshb , dsem , dsac , mms , iig , and tmd were determined using a least - squares regression technique . \n receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analyses were used to calculate the comparable threshold values of dshb , dsem , dsac , tmd , iig , and mms . \n optimal cutoff values were calculated using the youden index ( calculated as : sensitivity + specificity  100 ) . \n statistical analyses were performed using medcalc for windows , version 12.6.1.0 ( medcalc software , ostend , belgium ) . \n the level of statistical significance was p<0.05 , and p<0.0001 was considered to be very statistically significant . \n a total of 203 eligible patients ( 120 females , 83 males ) were included in this study . \n there were 28 of 203 patients ( 13.8% ) categorized as difficult laryngoscopy , and 50% of patients with difficult laryngoscopy in our study were males . \n no differences were noted in sex , age , and height , but bw and bmi values in the difficult laryngoscopy group were higher . the bmi value was 25.632.80 kg / m for the difficult laryngoscopy group , and 23.613.43 kg / m for the easy laryngoscopy group ( p<0.05 ) . \n airway evaluation parameters , including mms , tmd , iig , dshb , dsem , and dsac , are shown in table 2 . \n the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue measured by us were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group compared to the easy laryngoscopy group at the level of the hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure . \n however , no statistically significant difference was found between easy and difficult laryngoscopy groups for tmd and iig . \n a strong positive correlation existed between dsem and dshb ; moderate positive correlations between dsem and dsac , dshb and dsac ; small positive correlations between mms and dshb , mms and dsem , mms and dsac ; and very small positive correlations between tmd and iig . \n the correlation coefficients along with 95% confidence interval ( ci ) between dsem and dshb , dsem and dsac , dshb and dsac , mms and dshb , mms and dsem , mms and dsac , and between tmd and iig were 0.74 ( 0.670.80 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.60 ( 0.500.68 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.69 ( 0.610.75 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.32 ( 0.190.44 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.27 ( 0.140.40 , p=0.0001 ) , 0.32 ( 0.190.44 , p<0.0001 ) , 0.18 ( 0.05 to 0.31 , p=0.0089 ) , respectively ( figure 3a3 g ) . \n small negative correlation were found between iig and mms ( r=0.27 , p=0.0001 ) ; and very small negative correlations were found between mms and tmd ( r=0.20 , p=0.0042 ) , iig and dsac ( r=0.18 , p=0.0113 ) , and iig and dshb ( r=0.15 , p=0.0344 ) ( figure 3h3k ) . \n no correlations were found between tmd and dsem , tmd and dshb , and tmd and dsac ( data not shown ) . to further assess the roles of mms , iig , tmd , dshb , dsem , and dsac in predicting difficult laryngoscopy , \n the roc curves ( figure 4 ) were drawn using medcalc software with laryngoscopy grade over ii as the threshold of difficult laryngoscopy . as determined by the youden index , the optimal cutoff values ( with sensitivity and specificity in parentheses ) for mms , iig , tmd , dshb , dsem , and dsac to predict difficult laryngoscopy were over 2 ( 50.0% , 82.3% ) , 3.8 cm ( 75.0% , 48.0% ) , 5.9 cm ( 21.4% , 93.7% ) , 1.28 cm ( 85.7% , 85.1% ) , 1.78 cm ( 100.0% , 66.3% ) , and 1.1 cm ( 75.0% , 80.6% ) , respectively . \n the areas under the roc curve ( aucs ) were significantly different from the area under the reference line ( area=0.5 ) for mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac ; and the p values of mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac were all less than 0.0001 . \n no difference between the aucs of tmd , iig , and the area under the reference line were identified , suggesting that mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac might be better than tmd and iig in predicting difficult laryngoscopy ( table 3 ) . \n with the rapid expansion of portable us in anesthesia for guiding the placement of central venous catheters and the performance of regional block [ 1113 ] , some preliminary results exploring the feasibility of portable us in airway evaluation and management have been reported , even though the air attenuates us transmission and thereby creates artifacts [ 35,14,15 ] . in the present study , we compared the role of the us measurements and traditional screening tests , including iig , tmd , and mms , in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population . \n we found that strong positive linear correlations existed among the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue measured by us at hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels . \n the aucs of mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac are all over 0.7 , indicating they are all good parameters in predicting difficult laryngoscopy . \n the aucs of tmd and iig were less than 0.7 , suggesting that tmd and iig were poor parameters in predicating difficult laryngoscopy . to clearly visualize the glottis and smoothly finish the intubation procedure , anesthesiologists need to place the laryngoscope blade to the base of the epiglottis , and then lift it up \n therefore , in addition to the performer s skills and experience , many factors , including dental status , mouth opening , oropharyngeal space , mandibular space , and neck motility , are all involved this complicated procedure . \n mms mainly reflects the size of the tongue relative to the oral cavity , or the oropharyngeal space [ 1820 ] , iig means the mouth opening , and tmd can reflect the length of the neck . \n the mallapati score was first introduced by mallampati et al . in 1985 , and then modified by samsoon and young in 1987 . due to the simple and clear evaluation standards , mms has become one of the most commonly used tools to predict a difficult airway . \n however , mms mainly depends on patient cooperation and body position , which can greatly affect the accuracy of airway evaluation . \n therefore , mms has been reported to be a good predictor by many , but was found to be of limited value by others . a recent meta - analysis involving 177 088 patients \n demonstrate that mms is inadequate as a stand - alone test to predict difficult laryngoscopy or tracheal intubation , but it may well be a part of a multifactorial model for the prediction of a difficult tracheal intubation . \n iig has been repeatedly reported to be associated with difficult intubation , but our results showed that there was no significant difference in mean iig between difficult and easy laryngoscopy groups ( 3.740.43 vs. 3.860.47 cm ) . \n furthermore , the auc of iig was 0.580.06 , which was far less than 0.7 , suggesting that iig might be not a good screening parameter for predicting difficult laryngoscopy in our study . \n our iig conclusion was similar to the previous report by savva , but different from results of other studies . \n whether this difference was really caused by racial factors requires further investigation because the measurements of iig need patients to fully cooperate . \n tmd is also used as a screening test to predict difficult airway , but our results suggest that tmd is not a useful screening test . \n however , we could not determine whether this was because of limited patient numbers or because tmd was not useful in predicting difficult airway due to the small sample size . \n ct , mri , and other imaging techniques can accurately measure the thickness of anterior neck soft tissue , but they are expensive and unavailable in many operating rooms . \n portable us is inexpensive , rapid , and convenient to perform in the operating room , and most importantly , it can quantify the neck fat thickness as accurately as mi . \n however , the results of 2 prior studies focusing on soft tissue thickness at and below the level of the vocal cords in a specific group of obese patients are inconsistent . \n further measured the anterior neck soft tissue at the hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels , which is important to displace the glottis by the laryngoscopic blade , and found that us measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at the level of hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopies , and a 2.8-cm us measurement at the thyrohyoid membrane was a good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy . \n our results show that the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue at the level of the hyoid bone ( 1.51 [ 95% ci=1.401.61 ] cm vs. 0.98 [ 95% ci=0.941.02 ] cm ) , the thyrohyoid membrane ( 2.39 [ 95% ci=2.172.62 ] cm vs. 1.49 [ 95% ci=1.431.55 ] cm ) , and the anterior commissure ( 1.30 [ 95% ci=1.181.42 ] cm vs. 0.92 [ 95% ci=0.870.94 ] cm ) were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group and were significantly correlated . \n furthermore , the ranges of anterior neck soft tissue for those with difficult laryngoscopy were mutually exclusive from those patients with an easy laryngoscopy , indicating that they are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy , even though the ranges of these 3 parameters were smaller than in a previous report . \n glottis exposure by place laryngoscope is a very complicated procedure , and many subjective and objective factors such as the provider s skills and experience , airway secretions , and abnormalities of anatomical structures are involved in this procedure . \n the investigators were not totally blinded to the study purpose , and some clinical signs might indicate the possibility of difficult laryngoscopy , which can cause some bias during us measurements . due to the low incidence of difficult laryngoscopy , it is impossible for us to randomly assign an equal number of patients to both groups , thus there were 28 patients in the difficult group and 175 patients in the easy group . \n anterior neck soft tissue thicknesses measured by us at the hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy . the commonly used screening tests for difficult intubation have only poor - to - moderate predictive power when used alone . \n combinations of these screening tests or risk factors with us measurements might increase the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy .",

threatening events , such as cardiac tamponade . \n delayed postoperative cardiac tamponade following an open - heart operation is an infrequent , but potentially serious complication . \n although previous reports have dealt with the clinical features and management of this problem , an optimal approach to prevent postoperative pericardial effusion and related problems has not been clearly defined [ 3 , 5 ] . \n this study aims to investigate the effects of posterior pericardiotomy ( pp ) on the development of pericardial effusion , tamponade , and atrial fibrillation following cas . \n this prospective randomized case - controlled study was carried out on 96 patients ( 77 men and 19 women ; age : 35 - 78 years ; mean : 58.1 years ) . \n the patients , undergoing cas performed by the same surgical team between march 2012 and january 2013 in istanbul mehmet akif ersoy thoracic and cardiovascular surgery research and training hospital , were assigned to 3 groups . \n after the study had received the approval of the institutional review board , informed consent was obtained from all patients . \n the treating physician did not know the groups to which individual patients had been assigned . patients with renal failure , \n hyperthyroidism , emergency cas , history of cardiac operations associated with valvular heart disease , low ejection fraction ( < 35% ) , and preoperative atrial fibrillation or other rhythm disorders , as well as patients who did not provide research authorization , were excluded from the study . \n the study groups included patients after pp ( group i , n = 30 ) , a control group ( group ii , n = 33 ) , and patients without pp who received posterior pericardial tubes ( the tube was placed behind the heart and sutured to the adjacent pericardial tissue to avoid tube - induced ventricular arrhythmias ) ( group iii , n = 33 ) . \n i , a 4-cm longitudinal incision was made parallel and posterior to the left phrenic nerve , extending from the left inferior pulmonary vein to the diaphragm , as described by mulay et al . . \n in group i , the relationship between the location of the distal part of circumflex anastomosis and pp was also carefully considered . \n moreover , all patients underwent pleurotomy and lateral pericardiotomy ( approximately 3.5 - 4.5 cm in size ) in which the internal thoracic artery ( ita ) was used for anastomosis and positioned medially to the lung , which allowed the ita to run without kinking or twisting . \n the inferior part of the pericardium was left open ( 2 cm ) in our study . \n a straight tube was placed in the anterior mediastinum and an angled tube was placed in the left hemithorax in all patients . \n the same postoperative pain management protocol was provided for all patients . after a routine closure of the chest \n , drains were frequently milked and stripped to ensure tube patency during the intensive care unit stay . \n the chest tubes were removed on the 2 postoperative day when the drainage became serous ; otherwise , they remained in use for one or more days . \n pericardial effusion was defined as the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space determined by transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) . \n the presence of pericardial effusion on 2-dimensional tte was assessed using the criteria previously described by bakhshandeh et al . . \n two - dimensional echocardiography was performed on postoperative days 1 and 5 , as well as 1 month after surgery . \n the maximum diastolic separation between the pericardium and epicardium was measured at the tip of the mitral valve leaflet . \n when the diastolic echo - free space between the left ventricular posterior wall and the pericardium was < 10 mm , the pericardial effusion was classified as small . \n when the space was 10 - 20 mm , the effusion was classified as moderate , while for spaces > 20 mm , the effusion was classified as severe . \n if the diagnosis of evident pericardial effusion ( moderate or severe ) was established , tte was performed daily , and the volume of the effusion was observed closely . \n we compared the groups with regard to the volume of effusion on postoperative days 1 , 5 , and 30 . \n patients with no or small pericardial effusion and an uneventful postoperative course were discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5 . \n patients with moderate and severe pericardial effusion were treated with non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs . during hospitalization , \n all patients were continuously monitored with the use of a portable electrocardiogram ( ecg , telemetry ) to detect atrial fibrillation . \n atrial fibrillation was considered to be persistent and clinically significant when it lasted for more than 5 min . \n statistical analysis was performed with the ncss ( number cruncher statistical system ) 2007 statistical software ( utah , usa ) . \n one - way anova and tukey hsd tests were used for the statistical analysis of the groups parameters . \n the differences were also analyzed using  tests and independent t - tests where applicable . \n the hospital mortality in the study was 2% ( n = 2 ) ; both patients were in group ii . \n one of these patients experienced low cardiac output during and following reoperation due to cardiac tamponade and died on postoperative day 12 . \n the other patient had an uneventful postoperative course , but was readmitted to the hospital on postoperative day 11 due to cardiac tamponade and acute kidney failure . \n pericardial drainage was performed , but the patient died of sepsis on postoperative day 45 . \n the groups did not differ in terms of demographic parameters , which are summarized in table i. the average total volume of drainage ( mediastinal and thoracic ) during the first 24 hours was similar in all groups ( 536.67  237.873 cc , 656.97  407.634 cc , and 577.27  374.349 cc , respectively ; p = 0.383 ) ( table ii ) . \n in group i , the volume of the fluid evacuated by mediastinal drainage was lower than in groups ii and iii , but the difference was not statistically significant ( table ii ) . \n two patients in group ii required reoperation due to excessive mediastinal hemorrhage and cardiac tamponade . \n the incidence of cardiac tamponade was higher in group ii ( n = 4 , 12% ) , and the differences between the groups were statistically significant ( p = 0.019 ) . \n two of the patients with pericardial tamponade were managed by subxiphoid pericardial drainage alone ; 400 to 1000 ml of fluid was removed . \n two patients in group iii were reoperated due to excessive hemorrhage in the early postoperative period . \n demographic variables in groups differential drainage volume from each chest tube the volume of pericardial drainage was added to the volume of mediastinal drainage for group iii . \n the average volume of pericardial effusion significantly decreased with time in groups i and ii ( fig . \n approximately 50% of the patients had small pericardial effusion on the first postoperative day ; no difference between the groups was found . \n moderate pericardial effusion was detected in 8 patients ( group i , n = 1 ; group ii , n = 3 ; group iii , n = 4 ) on the first postoperative day , in 11 patients ( group ii , n = 7 ; group iii , n = 4 ) on the fifth postoperative day , and in 7 patients on the 30 postoperative day ( group ii , n = 6 ; group iii , n = 1 ) during the study period . \n severe pericardial effusion was detected in one patient ( group ii , n = 1 ) on the first postoperative day , in one patient ( group iii , n = 1 ) on the fifth postoperative day , and in one patient ( group iii , n = 1 ) on the 30 postoperative day . \n the incidence of moderate to severe pericardial effusion in group i was significantly lower than in the other groups on the 30 postoperative day ( n = 0 , p = 0.028 ) . \n figure 1 shows a comparison of the groups with regard to the volume of pericardial effusion . \n four of these patients ( group ii , n = 4 ) underwent drainage of severe pericardial effusion on postoperative days 0 , 1 , 11 , and 17 ; one patient ( group ii ) underwent sternal dehiscence repair . \n comparison of the groups with regard to the volume of pericardial effusion atrial fibrillation was detected in 24 of the 96 patients ( 25% : 6 patients in group i , 11 patients in group ii , 7 patients in group iii ) . \n no statistically significant difference between the groups ( p = 0.392 ) was present in this respect . \n the length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in group i ( 6.63  2.71 , p = 0.03 ) . \n there are a number of articles favoring the use of posterior pericardiotomy , but no comprehensive comparison has been conducted between the use of a pericardial tube and pp in patients undergoing cas . \n pericardial effusion and the associated complications are common after all kinds of cardiac surgery due to postoperative bleeding or post - cardiotomy syndrome . \n however , clinically significant pericardial effusion occurs rarely and can be a crucial risk factor for cardiac tamponade ( 1% ) . \n posterior pericardiotomy has been reported to reduce the prevalence of pericardial effusion from 40% to 8% with a simultaneous reduction in the prevalence of svt ( supraventricular tachycardia ) . \n the semi - sitting position helps thoracic drainage in the early postoperative period by supporting the patient 's back . despite all the above - mentioned measures , the posterior wall of the pericardial sac forms an unprotected space that may cause pericardial effusion to develop septae . \n this leads to the appearance of adhesions preventing blood drainage , leading to cardiac compression . \n moreover , the collection of fluid may persist due to bleeding resulting from the use of anticoagulants . \n in fact , anti - coagulants ( low - molecular - weight heparin ) were used postoperatively in our patients with atrial fibrillation . \n posterior pericardial effusion can be evacuated by placing a tube in the posterior pericardial space . \n the placement of the pericardial tube is simple to perform , but it may have certain drawbacks . the tube may come into contact with coronary grafts during cardiac activity or movement . \n however , the patients included in the study ( in group iii as well as the other groups ) did not exhibit any arrhythmias ( apart from af ) or ischemic changes \n . this may be due to the fact that we fixed the pericardial tube to the surface of the diaphragmatic pericardium with polypropylene . \n pp or the use of posterior tubes may lessen the volume of pericardial effusion after cas . \n moreover , patients in group i exhibited regression of pericardial effusion during 30 postoperative days . \n this proved that pp had a lasting effect on pericardial effusion , as presented by figure 1 . \n what stands out in our results is that pericardial effusion may occur if no intervention is performed on the posterior part of the pericardium . \n this technique is suggested in both cas and valve surgery , but it is not routinely used [ 13 , 14 ] . \n what is more , pp is recommended by the american college of chest physicians guidelines and by some authors as a preventive technique for postoperative atrial fibrillation [ 15 , 16 ] . \n supraventricular tachyarrhythmias , mainly in the form of atrial fibrillation , occur in up to 40% of patients undergoing cas . \n although af is usually benign , it can cause hemodynamic instability , prolonged hospital stay , and increased cost and , in rare cases , predispose to cerebrovascular accidents . \n the antiarrhythmic effect of pp may , however , be a theoretical issue , as we observed similar results regarding atrial fibrillation in all the groups . \n in fact , the results of our study were different than expected with regard to atrial fibrillation compared to other researchers [ 4 , 6 , 16 ] . \n additionally , asimakopoulos et al . also found that the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was not significantly reduced ( 20% ) in comparison to the conventional technique ( 26% ) . \n another issue is that humans have increasingly longer life spans , which may result in higher numbers of reoperations . \n ellman et al . found that patent coronary grafts were the most commonly injured structures during reoperation ( 46% ) . \n we routinely cover the aorta and proximal anastomoses of grafts with thymic fat tissue and the anterior wall of the pericardial cavity . \n we also place an anterior mediastinal tube over the thymic fat tissue before closing the sternum in all patients . behind the heart , \n adhesions between the inferior surface of the heart and the diaphragm can cause difficulties when dissecting the tissue layers during reoperation . \n mulay et al . demonstrated that pp provides an effective drainage pathway from the left pleural cavity , thereby reducing the prevalence of pericardial effusion . \n for this reason , pp may be advantageous for reoperated patients in terms of reducing adhesions related to pericardial effusion . \n echocardiography can be useful in confirming and identifying the presence of pericardial effusion , hematoma , and tamponade . according to the results of our study , it is important to diagnose pericardial effusion at an early stage . \n hemodynamic deterioration due to pericardial fluid can be divided into four stages : pericardial fluid , hemodynamic tamponade , echocardiographic tamponade , clinical tamponade . \n echocardiographic follow - up of patients with pericardial effusion might be a factor extending the duration of hospital stay . \n we recommend the pp technique and routine echocardiographic monitoring during the postoperative period in patients undergoing cas . \n there is not sufficient research regarding the effects of pp on long - term results . \n the present study also demonstrated that patients undergoing pp required a significantly shorter hospital stay and experienced lower rates of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade than the other groups . \n this research was carried out on a small set of patients ( n = 96 ) ; therefore , there was an imbalance between men and women enrolled in this trial . \n group ii had a 2-fold elevation in the number of patients going into af postoperatively . \n in conclusion , pp may be a useful technique in the prevention of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade after cas because it is simple , safe , and effective . \n . \n oral presentation at the 22 \n annual meeting of the asian society for cardiovascular and thoracic surgery that will be held in istanbul on april 3 -

         "cancer places a huge burden on society and has been identified as the leading cause of death in both more and less economically developed countries . \n projections based on the globocan 2012 estimates predict a substantive increase to 19.3 million new cancer cases per year by 2025 , due to growth and ageing of the global population . \n south africa , like other developing countries , is also experiencing an increase in the overall burden of disease attributable to cancer , with the number of new cancer cases predicted to increase by 46% by 2030 . \n this is likely to result in an increase in the use of cancer chemotherapy agents , which assist in preventing the proliferation , invasion , and metastases of the cancer cells . \n the basis for chemotherapy is anticancer drugs containing platinum , that is , cisplatin ( cis - diamminedichloroplatinum ii ) and carboplatin ( cis - diammine 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylatoplatinum ii ) . \n other chemotherapy drugs include nitrogen mustard , amino - nicotinamide , dichloromethotrexate , bleomycin , and 5-fluorouracil [ 5 , 6 ] . \n the first of these drugs , that is , cisplatin , consists of a divalent pt ( ii ) central atom and four ligands of cis - positioned pairs of chlorine atoms or amine groups . \n since its discovery in the 1970s , cisplatin continues to be hailed as one of the most potent cancer chemotherapeutics in children and adults , as it is unique and unmatched in its effectiveness against many cancers , namely , osteogenic sarcoma , medulloblastoma , testicular , cervical , and ovarian cancers . \n similarly , its toxicity profile is expansive , involving the gastrointestinal , hematologic , renal , and auditory systems . \n while the use of saline hydration and mannitol diuresis may prevent nephrotoxicity , neurotoxicity is still not curable or preventable . \n ototoxicity refers to the hearing disorder that results from the temporary or permanent inner ear dysfunction after treatment with an ototoxic drug . \n other drug classes known to have ototoxic properties include aminoglycosides , loop diuretics , quinine , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and antiretroviral therapy ( art ) . \n this is of concern in south africa , as it is estimated that 12.2% of the population ( 6.4 million persons ) were hiv positive in 2012 , which is 1.2 million more people living with hiv than in 2008 ( 10.6% , or 5.2 million ) . \n resultantly , art exposure had almost doubled from 16.6% in 2008 to 31.2% in 2012 . \n not only will many infected people be at risk for ototoxicity due to arts , but a large number will also be susceptible to hiv - related cancers , such as kaposi 's sarcoma , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma , and cervical cancer , as well as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis , conditions that often require pharmacological therapy with the adverse side effect of ototoxicity . \n it is possible that their treatments could consist of simultaneous use of more than one ototoxic drug , increasing the likelihood of ototoxicity . \n all health care professionals managing patients with cancer should therefore be knowledgeable about the ototoxic properties of cisplatin . \n however , malhotra   indicated that most oncologists in india do not make referrals for audiological evaluations of patients receiving cisplatin , while a study in south africa revealed that the effects of ototoxicity , the role of audiologists , and need for their expertise were not fully realized by the oncologists sampled . \n this is further supported by evidence from the south african study of khoza - shangase and jina   which indicated that most general practitioners sampled also do not appear to carry out ototoxicity monitoring strategies , despite being aware of their own role within an ototoxicity monitoring programme . \n this review therefore aims to serve as resource for health professionals to enhance their understanding of ototoxicity as well as their roles within an ototoxicity monitoring programme by providing an overview and description of this condition in patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving cisplatin chemotherapy . \n the review identified peer - reviewed articles available from january 1975 to july 2015 on the topic of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity and ototoxicity monitoring and included english articles only . \n the same researcher conducted the literature search and reviewed the abstracts and articles for inclusion in the study . \n studies were identified using keyword and mesh term searches of electronic databases depicted in table 1 . a manual search of relevant authors and journals \n the references cited by each publication , review , or book chapter were reviewed in order to locate additional potential publications . in order to be selected , the article had to present data on either cisplatin ototoxicity and/or ototoxicity monitoring in human participants , and no research designs were excluded . running these searches yielded a total of 2106 records , of which 1581 were excluded based on the title and/or abstract as well as duplication . \n eighty - five relevant articles , comprising six national and 79 international articles , were selected . \n a perusal of narrative reviews of other auditory pathologies was conducted in an attempt to determine areas of significance for an overview of cisplatin ototoxicity . \n this resulted in the following eight areas being included : the mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity , clinical presentation , risk factors , incidence rates in adults and children , the effect on quality of life , ototoxicity monitoring , otoprotective strategies , and management of an ototoxic hearing loss . \n one such mechanism , the antioxidant model , involves the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) within the cochlea and consequent reduction in antioxidant enzymes following exposure to cisplatin chemotherapy [ 1620 ] . \n another mechanism of cisplatin ototoxicity involves the significant contribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 3 isoform ( nox3 ) to the generation of reactive oxygen species within the cochlea , when activated by cisplatin [ 17 , 21 ] , while a third mechanism relates to the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel ( trpv1 ) [ 2224 ] . \n the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity therefore include the following:creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation ands - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  .with the cellular mechanisms of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity including damage to the outer hair cells , supporting cells , marginal cells of the stria vascularis , spiral ligament , and the spiral ganglion cells , it is evident that the structures of the inner ear are most susceptible to damage by cisplatin chemotherapy , with apoptotic degeneration of the hair cell in the organ of corti being most prominent . \n the outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea are most affected [ 27 , 28 ] . \n this leads to an initial elevation of high frequency audiometric thresholds , followed by a progressive loss into the lower frequencies with continued therapy [ 27 , 28 ] . \n knowledge of the different mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity is important for health care professionals as it will create an awareness of its complexity and the resulting clinical presentation . \n creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation and s - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  . \n cisplatin - associated ototoxicity usually manifests as irreversible , progressive , bilateral , high frequency sensorineural hearing loss   with tinnitus . \n the latter may occur with or without a hearing loss   and may be permanent or transient , sometimes disappearing a few hours after treatment   or alternatively persisting a week after treatment . while most of the hearing loss is permanent , there is sometimes sporadic and partial recovery . in addition , \n rare cases of unilateral hearing loss have been reported , which are usually explained by tumour location and surgical or therapeutic intervention on the affected side . moreover \n , the hearing loss is not always symmetrical [ 33 , 34 ] , with jenkins et al .   finding that 75% of women on cisplatin chemotherapy displayed an asymmetry of hearing thresholds of at least 10  db between ears posttreatment . \n schmidt et al . , in their investigation of 55 children on cisplatin chemotherapy , found that the high frequency hearing thresholds were slightly elevated in the left ear and that males had a greater degree of hearing loss than the females . \n the degree of hearing loss is often variable and is related to the dose ; that is , the higher the cumulative dose , the greater the ototoxic effect [ 35 , 36 ] . \n the duration , number of cycles administered , and method of administration   also influence cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . \n additional factors that may increase ototoxicity include exposure to concomitant noise , chemicals , and other ototoxic medications . \n furthermore , evidence also shows that melanin content is related to an increased risk of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . \n individuals with dark eyes and therefore a higher melanin content in the cochlear are at greater risk of ototoxic damage , as the melanin causes retention of the platinum within the cochlear and subsequently increases the risk of damage [ 41 , 42 ] . \n individuals presenting with renal insufficiency , that is , high levels of serum creatinine , are at a greater risk for cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . genetic risk factors , such as megalin and glutathione s - transferases gene polymorphism , have also been reported to influence cisplatin ototoxicity , as do physiological factors such as age , with younger children   and older adults ( older than 46 years )   presenting with a greater severity of hearing damage . \n awareness of these risk factors may assist health care professionals with informational counselling of the patient receiving cisplatin chemotherapy . \n the incidence of cisplatin ototoxicity is variable in adults ( table 2 ) and children ( table 3 ) . \n the variations may be due to a number of factors , such as differences in the dose , both within a cycle and the total amount administered over multiple cycles , time interval between courses , method of administration , and treatment duration , as well as differences in patient population . \n ototoxicity poses a major problem to the cancer patient , as the quality of life after receiving cisplatin chemotherapy may be negatively affected due to hearing loss , resulting in social , emotional , and vocational difficulties , as effective communication is often hindered . \n tasks that normal hearing persons take for granted may become challenging and frustrating . in addition , an individual 's safety may be compromised due to the hearing loss , as appropriate response to alarms and warning signals may be delayed . \n furthermore , a hearing loss may also result in psychosocial and physical health problems , as well as depression and social isolation . \n hence , hearing loss , often referred to as the  invisible condition ,  has serious visible ramifications on the quality of life of a hearing impaired individual . \n this is particularly relevant if the individual has already experienced the hearing world , as the hearing function is never restored to normal , even though patients may benefit from the use of assistive listening devices , such as hearing aids and cochlear implants . \n the impact of an ototoxic hearing loss may be more profound for infants and young children who are at a critical stage of their speech and language development . \n furthermore , the high frequency nature of an ototoxic hearing loss may result in speech recognition and comprehension being compromised , resulting in possible neurocognitive and psychosocial delays . \n there is also an elevated risk for academic learning problems and psychosocial difficulties in school - aged children and adolescents . \n literature indicated that childhood survivors of neuroblastoma had twice the rate of difficulties , as indicated by parent reports , with reading and math skills , and/or attention and a higher risk of a general learning disability than those without a hearing loss . \n there was also poorer self - reported quality of life scores in these children with regard to school functioning . \n hence , cisplatin - associated ototoxicity further complicates the morbidity of cancer patients , as it would also isolate them from family members and significant others at a time when they require the greatest support . \n advancements in medical knowledge and technology , such as screening and early detection of several cancers , have resulted in notable improvements in relative five - year survival rates for cancer [ 64 , 65 ] . \n therefore , improving the quality of life after cisplatin - based chemotherapy becomes increasingly important , and resulting comorbidities such as ototoxicity can be managed appropriately and immediately   if adequate monitoring is in place . \n the nature of ototoxicity is such that it often goes undetected until speech intelligibility is affected   and is usually detected when a communication problem becomes evident . \n communication problems , such as constantly asking for repetition or not responding when spoken to , signify that the hearing loss has progressed to the frequencies important for understanding speech . in this case , \n an audiological monitoring programme can avert , to a large extent , the reduced quality of life as a result of hearing loss , as patients on cisplatin chemotherapy can be identified early , counselled , monitored , and managed appropriately through interventions in a logical , systematic , and coherent manner . \n audiological monitoring should aim to identify the hearing loss early and reduce its impact on the individual 's life by means of proper medical and hearing intervention . \n prospective audiological evaluations remain the only reliable method for detecting ototoxicity before it becomes symptomatic . \n an ototoxicity monitoring programme should involve a health care team comprising of an oncology nurse , oncologists , audiologist , and pharmacist to ensure effective sustainability of such a programme , if implemented , with the patient being the central focus . \n the audiologist is involved in identifying an ototoxic hearing loss , informing the oncologist of such a development , counselling the patient and their family , and prescribing amplification devices , such as hearing aids and cochlear implants . \n early identification of an ototoxic hearing loss provides oncologists with an opportunity to adjust the chemotherapy regimen in order to reduce or prevent further deterioration of hearing . the oncologist and nurses should also counsel patients on the side effects of cisplatin , including ototoxicity , in an attempt to prepare them for treatment outcomes and help them set realistic expectations . \n pharmacists who have access to a patient 's medication list may also alert the oncologists and audiologists to those who are on other ototoxic medication and therefore at a greater risk for cisplatin - induced ototoxicity . \n effective management of such patients using evidence - based practices may improve management of those with cancer , ensuring that they and their families are counselled and appropriate interventions are timeously implemented . \n the principles of early identification and early intervention are a part of ototoxicity monitoring , and the audiologist can manage such a programme . in countries without ototoxicity management guidelines , the  guidelines for the audiological management of individuals receiving cochleotoxic drug therapy  developed by the american association of speech - language - hearing association   may , consequently , guide the audiologist in the implementation of an ototoxicity monitoring programme within a local , regional , or national setting . for widespread acceptance and use , \n ototoxicity monitoring programmes need to incorporate efficient and cost - effective ototoxicity identification techniques , while considering the health care system and demographics of the patient population being managed . \n for any population receiving ototoxic medication , the following should be considered :  ( 1 ) the patient 's level of alertness or ability to respond reliably ; ( 2 ) the most appropriate times during the treatment protocol for test administration , and ; ( 3 ) the test should comprise the baseline , monitoring and post - treatment evaluations  . \n appropriate time intervals for audiological assessments may differ depending on the type of cancer as well as the frequency and dose of cisplatin ( figure 2 ) . \n the audiological assessments should incorporate a detailed case history , otoscopic examination , immittance audiometry , speech audiometry , dpoaes , and conventional and extended high frequency audiometry ( i.e. , up to 20  000  hz ) ( hfa ) [ 69 , 73 ] . these procedures are all conducted for the baseline assessment and the six - month follow - up evaluation [ 69 , 73 ] . while auditory brainstem response may be used , it is not considered a standard procedure for monitoring ototoxicity . monitoring audiological evaluations during treatment and the one- and three - month follow - up evaluations include case interview , otoscopy , and immittance audiometry as well as air conduction pure tone and objective testing . however , full - frequency threshold testing is impractical for many patients on cisplatin chemotherapy , as these individuals are often extremely ill and easily fatigued . the use of abbreviated threshold monitoring procedures that are clinically practical for these patients is therefore recommended . \n one such method involves the use of the sensitive range for ototoxicity ( sro ) . \n this is  the highest frequency with a threshold at or below 100  db spl followed by the next six lower adjacent frequencies in 1/6-octave steps or the one octave range near the highest audible frequency  . \n sro is usually determined during the baseline evaluation and is dependent on each patient 's hearing threshold configuration . during monitoring evaluations \n however , full - frequency testing should be conducted within the same session if an asha significant hearing change is noted within the sro . \n if a patient on cisplatin chemotherapy is still responsive and alert , the protocol presented above would be suitable . \n however , a patient who has limited responsiveness may be required to undergo the same audiological evaluations , except speech audiometry . \n patients who are responsive as well as those who have limited responses can undergo both behavioural and objective testing . however , those patients who are too ill or too young to respond should undergo only objective testing , such as otoscopy , tympanometry , acoustic reflexes , and dpoaes or abrs . while pure tone audiometry in the conventional frequency range is suitable for evaluating hearing in the range responsible for speech understanding , as well as for differential diagnosis , it is less sensitive to detecting early ototoxic change [ 11 , 70 ] . \n the two tests identified as being the most important for the early detection of cisplatin ototoxicity are hfas and oaes , each also having limitations ( see table 4 ) \n . therefore , using each test in isolation may not be as effective as utilizing a test battery approach , as it increases the chances of obtaining reliable audiologic monitoring data over time . \n in addition , these two tests could be used to complement one another in every cycle of chemotherapy to ensure the earliest detection of ototoxicity . the ototoxicity monitoring protocol proposed by \n asha   represents an aggressive and ideal approach for monitoring ototoxicity and is dependent on a country 's infrastructure and resource constraints . \n the asha   guidelines may therefore not be generalized to a country without considering the contextual factors that may influence its applicability to that country . \n however , it does provide guidance towards creating a roadmap that countries , such as south africa , may aspire towards in implementing an ototoxicity monitoring programme . \n similar to india , no programmes have been formally implemented to identify and monitor ototoxicity in patients on cancer chemotherapy in south africa . as a result , there is no contextually relevant research to steer the implementation of an accountable and effective ototoxicity monitoring program in the country . \n this is probably one of the main reasons for ototoxicity monitoring programmes not being commonplace in local hospitals and clinics . \n in addition , the health of south africans is characterized by a quadruple burden of disease , encompassing the occurrence of infectious diseases , the rise of noncommunicable diseases , and perinatal and maternal disorders , as well as injuries and violence , which may result in cancer receiving low priority for health care services . however \n , the creation of an audiological monitoring programme allows for better control of cancer related comorbidities . over the years \n , a number of studies have investigated the use of otoprotectants with cisplatin , their purpose being to protect the inner ear from any injury while not interfering with the antitumor effects of cisplatin . \n otoprotective strategies include reducing the formation of free radicals by maintaining glutathione levels and antioxidant activity . \n three mechanisms may provide protection against cisplatin , these being endogenous molecules , exogenous agents , or a combination of exogenous agents that trigger endogenous protective mechanisms . \n however , endogenous agents are not effective against cisplatin when the dose exceeds a certain threshold [ 17 , 81 ] . \n nearly all of the otoprotective agents are sulfur- or sulfhydryl - containing compounds ( thio compounds ) , known as antioxidants , and potent heavy metal chelators . \n the numerous otoprotective agents utilized in clinical and animal studies include amifostine , d - or l - methionine , methylthiobenzoic acid , lipoic acid , tiopronin , glutathione ester , sodium thiosulfate , melatonin , vitamin e , n - acetylcysteine , dexamethasone , and resveratrol . however \n , none of these agents have been found to be unequivocally beneficial in preventing cisplatin ototoxicity and no agent is currently recommended for routine use . further research is therefore needed to find new methods and optimize old ones to prevent and/or treat hearing loss during cisplatin therapy . \n in addition , intratympanic administration of medication together with gene therapy needs to be further explored . \n intratympanic administration involves the diffusion of the otoprotective agent across the round window into the inner ear , where its therapeutic effect is exerted . \n an advantage of this method of administration is that there are higher concentrations of the otoprotective agent in the inner ear , this being in comparison to the use of oral or parenteral administration , without potentially reducing the efficacy of the cisplatin treatment [ 89 , 90 ] . \n the disadvantage of this procedure , however , is that each ear would have to be treated with a moderately invasive procedure . alternatively \n , gene therapy may prove to be beneficial in protecting an individual against cisplatin - induced hearing loss as several genes , namely , megalin , glutathione - s - transferases , thiopurine s - methyltransferase , and catechol - o - methyl transferase , may be responsible for susceptibility to hearing loss . \n if a cisplatin - associated hearing loss results in communication difficulties , it is the audiologist 's ethical responsibility to begin or recommend aural rehabilitation . \n however , this intervention should not only occur once hearing loss has been detected but before the patient begins the cisplatin chemotherapy . \n aural rehabilitation techniques such as speech reading and counselling on compensatory communication strategies should be conducted . \n the counselling should include spouses and significant other , as hearing loss may not only impact the person with cancer but also frequent communication partners . \n patients with sensorineural hearing loss due to the use of cisplatin may also benefit from the use of assistive listening devices such as hearing aids or cochlear implants . \n children with ototoxic hearing loss may also require the use of personal frequency modulated systems in the classroom . \n furthermore , with the recent developments in hearing aid technology , a patient with an ototoxic hearing loss is more likely to receive the desired amplification benefit . \n these hearing aids are able to amplify sounds at and above 8000  hz . however , there is limited data indicating significant improvements in speech recognition with the use of this technology .hearing aids with frequency lowering technology achieved by linear frequency transposition , nonlinear frequency compression , or spectral envelope warping . \n frequency lowering is used to overcome the limits of either the bandwidth of the device or the functional bandwidth of the ear , by lowering high frequency energy to a region that is more likely to provide and/or benefit from audible sound . \n while there are no published studies suggesting one approach to be superior to another , frequency lowering technology has been found to improve audibility and speech understanding of high frequency sounds . \n commercially available types of frequency lowering signal processing include frequency transposition ( widex ) , nonlinear frequency compression ( phonak ) , and frequency translation ( starkey ) . \n these processors are commercially labelled as audibility extender , soundrecover , and spectral iq , respectively . \n these hearing aids are able to amplify sounds at and above 8000  hz . however , there is limited data indicating significant improvements in speech recognition with the use of this technology . \n hearing aids with frequency lowering technology achieved by linear frequency transposition , nonlinear frequency compression , or spectral envelope warping . \n frequency lowering is used to overcome the limits of either the bandwidth of the device or the functional bandwidth of the ear , by lowering high frequency energy to a region that is more likely to provide and/or benefit from audible sound . \n while there are no published studies suggesting one approach to be superior to another , frequency lowering technology has been found to improve audibility and speech understanding of high frequency sounds . \n commercially available types of frequency lowering signal processing include frequency transposition ( widex ) , nonlinear frequency compression ( phonak ) , and frequency translation ( starkey ) . \n these processors are commercially labelled as audibility extender , soundrecover , and spectral iq , respectively . \n this review has highlighted that cisplatin ototoxicity is a frequent adverse event of cisplatin chemotherapy that may negatively affect the quality of life of patients with cancer . \n the different molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cisplatin - associated ototoxicity highlight the complexity of this condition and the consequent difficulty in identifying an effective otoprotective agent . \n the varying incidence rates reported in both adults and paediatrics may be due to the different audiological tests employed in the monitoring of the cancer patient 's hearing status and therefore highlight the importance of the use of extended high frequency audiometry and dpoaes in ototoxicity monitoring . \n an audiological monitoring programme comprising a team of health care professionals , knowledgeable about cisplatin ototoxicity , may therefore serve to improve evidence - based service delivery to these patients .",
         "cisplatin is an effective drug used in the treatment of many cancers , yet its ototoxic potential places cancer patients , exposed to this drug , at risk of hearing loss , thus negatively impacting further on a patient 's quality of life . \n it is paramount for health care practitioners managing such patients to be aware of cisplatin 's ototoxic properties and the clinical signs to identify patients at risk of developing hearing loss . \n english peer - reviewed articles from january 1975 to july 2015 were assessed from pubmed , science direct , and ebscohost . \n seventy - nine articles and two books were identified for this review , using mesh terms and keywords such as  ototoxicity  ,  cisplatin  ,  hearing loss  , and  ototoxicity monitoring  . \n this review provides an up - to - date overview of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity , namely , its clinical features , incidence rates , and molecular and cellular mechanisms and risk factors , to health care practitioners managing the patient with cancer , and highlights the need for a team - based approach to complement an audiological monitoring programme to mitigate any further loss in the quality of life of affected patients , as there is currently no otoprotective agent recommended routinely for the prevention of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . \n it also sets the platform for effective dialogue towards policy formulation and strengthening of health systems in developing countries .",

         "twenty - two workers were followed up from 15th april to 30th april 2008 during working hours , from approximately 6 am to 3 pm , for a total of 160 working hours . \n this included only workers who had worked more than 50% of each day 's working period and had worked for at least 10 days of the follow - up period . \n information regarding the amount of liquid intake expressed ( in litres , l ) and daily productivity output ( in tons ) were recorded . \n the rehydration strategies were re - structured by decision makers participating in the project and the author of this paper . \n for an eight working hour schedule , all workers were instructed to drink 1 l of the rehydration solutions or tap water at least 30 minutes before they began to work . \n they were also encouraged to drink water and rehydration solutions ( 250 ml ) every 3045 minutes . in total , they were each asked to drink 10 l of liquid ( tap water and rehydration solutions ) per day . in order to facilitate the monitoring of basic heat stress indexes during the 2007/2008 harvesting season , temperature , \n humidity and dew point were measured by using a portable temperature monitoring device (  easylog , model el - usb-2 ) . \n variables such as heart rate and weight were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the working day . neither the amount of liquid intake nor productivity was validated . \n wet bulb globe temperature ( wbgt ) values during the 2007 harvest season at montelimar farm descriptive statistics were used to analyse climate data ( temperature ( c ) ; relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production . \n chi - squared test was used to evaluate liquid intake versus output production by using spss version 13 . \n descriptive statistics were used to analyse climate data ( temperature ( c ) ; relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production . \n chi - squared test was used to evaluate liquid intake versus output production by using spss version 13 . \n 1 shows in situ hourly climate variation direct from the sugarcane fields while workers harvested the crop . \n as can be seen , temperature and relative humidity values oscillated from 23.5 to 34.5c and from 40% to 64% , respectively , reaching maximum values as early as 810 am . \n this meant that water distribution had to be started at around that time on an hourly basis . \n climate measurements during 160 working hours of follow - up for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n table 2 shows the amount of liquid intake ( including both regular tap water and specially formulated rehydration drinks ) . \n what is of great concern is that , although temperature increased to maximum values early in the morning , many workers did not follow the rehydration measures and drank less than 6 l , a potentially dangerously low volume . \n comparison between temperature measurements and daily water intake for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n this showed that 13 workers who had the highest production output ( range 68 tons , average 7.45 tons ) were those who drank more than 6 l of liquid ( regular tap water and/or specially formulated rehydration solutions ) in comparison to those who drank less liquid and had a smaller production output . \n relationship between production output and daily water intake for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n measurements of heart rate and body weight at the start and end of the working day showed that workers experienced increases in heart rate and loss of body weight as they worked in these hot conditions . \n historically , monitoring of toxins in the work environment has been the primary focus for identifying risks . \n some potential biomarkers linked to cell injury are immunological factors , lymphokines , growth factors , prostaglandins , endothelins , collagen , adhesion molecules , thromboxanes , leukotrienes , platelet activating factors and heat shock proteins ( 10 ) . as mentioned earlier , heat illness is a major cause of preventable morbidity worldwide ( 1 ) and although human beings possess considerable ability to compensate for naturally occurring heat stress , many occupational environments and/or physical activities expose workers to heat loads which are so excessive as to threaten their health and productivity ( 11 ) . \n it is important to remember that the normal human body contains approximately 60% of water , \n the present project evaluated climatic conditions at sugarcane plantations located at sea level , on the southwest coast of nicaragua . \n monitored climate indices ( temperature and relative humidity ) values varied from 23.5 to 34.5c and from 40% to 64% , respectively , reaching maximum values as early as 8 am . according to the nicaraguan institute of territorial studies ( ineter ) ( 13 ) , relative humidity values for the whole month of april varied between 69 and 79% all along nicaragua 's pacific coastline from san juan del sur ( southern region ) to chinandega ( western region ) . \n managua lies between the two regions ; the montelimar sugar farm is located 62 km from managua . \n however , the ineter humidity data are quite different from the relative humidity registered on the farm located in western managua . \n temperature data were not available at ineter 's website . although only 22 subjects were followed - up for a short period of time in this study , important results were obtained . \n other authors have shown the relationship between heat stress health effects and the ability to perform different tasks , as well as the increased risk of suffering work - related injuries ( 14 ) . in this study , the workers drank more liquid as temperature values increased to maximum peaks . \n this was part of a rehydration process which was well planned in advance by the company 's decision makers . unlike during past harvesting seasons , when water and rehydration solutions were distributed quite randomly , during this harvesting season cool water and specially formulated drinks were distributed or intended to be distributed to workers , who received 1 l just before they began their working day and then 500 ml every 30 minutes . \n the basis of this principle is that drinking to satisfy thirst is not enough to keep a person well hydrated . \n most of the people become aware of thirst once they have lost 12 l of body water and persons highly motivated to perform hard work may incur losses of 34 l before serious thirst forces them to stop and drink . \n since dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off - duty hours ( 14 ) . \n there was a significant increase of production , with up to 8 tons per worker during the follow - up period compared to the normal 5.5 tons per worker prior to the change in rehydration measures . \n this important change in rehydration policies and increase in production output is the result of various efforts of training workers , foremen and managers on heat stress prevention , proper hydration measures and quality of ( working ) life carried out by occupational health and safety professionals ( physicians and engineers ) , human resources departments and top management at sugarcane farms . \n . often workers rejected the new rehydration measures , most of the time because it was difficult for them to understand thoroughly the dehydration and physiological compensatory mechanisms . \n some of the reasons for this can be attributed to their low educational level , and feeling that  nothing bad has ever happened to me before , etc . \n certainly more effort in terms of intervention strategies and scientific investigation needs to be carried out among workers in nicaragua who perform jobs in which they are exposed to high ambient temperatures . \n these include farm workers , construction workers , miners and fishermen , especially those employed in the informal sector , which occupies about half of nicaragua 's economically active population . \n more funds should also be designated by companies decision makers for improving basic working conditions , in order to increase overall productivity ( and workers satisfaction in terms of better wages ) . \n this would also translate into safer and healthier workers , less absenteeism from sick leave , fewer accidents and other incidents . \n the author has not received any funding or benefits from industry to conduct this study .",
         "backgroundheat illness is a major cause of preventable morbidity worldwide . \n workers exposed to intense heat can become unable to activate compensation mechanisms , putting their health at risk . \n heat stress also has a direct impact on production by causing poor task performance and it increases the possibility of work - related morbidity and injuries . during the sugarcane harvest period , workers are exposed to excessive sunlight and heat from approximately 6 am to 3 pm . \n a first assessment of heat stress during the 2006/2007 harvesting season served to redesign the existing rehydration measures . in this project , \n sugarcane workers were provided with more rehydration solutions and water during their work schedule.objectiveto assess heat stress preventive measures in order to improve existing rehydration strategies as a means of increasing productivity.methodsa small group of 22 workers were followed up for 15 days during working hours , from 6 am to 3 pm . \n selection criteria were defined : to have worked more than 50% of the day 's working schedule and to have worked for at least 10 days of the follow - up period . \n a simple data recollection sheet was used . \n information regarding the amount of liquid intake was registered . \n production output data was also registered . \n temperature measurements were recorded by using a portable temperature monitoring device (  easylog , model el - usb-2).resultsthe average temperature measurements were above the nicaraguan ministry of labour thresholds . \n seven workers drank 78 l of liquid , improving their production . \n output production increased significantly ( p=0.005 ) among those best hydrated , from 5.5 to 8 tons of cut sugarcane per worker per day.conclusionsproductivity improved with the new rehydration measures . \n awareness among workers concerning heat stress prevention was increased .",

         "choroid plexus papilloma ( cpp ) is a rare benign tumor accounting for 0.5% of all intracranial tumors that is more common in childhood , consisting of 1.5 to 6.4% of pediatric intracranial tumors.1 \n 2 the majority of cpps occur during the first 2 years of life , with 12.5 to 20% ( 10 to 12% ) reported in infants under 1  year of age.1 \n 3 there have been some reports of  calcified cpp ,   cpp in an adult , \n cpp in the cerebellopontine angle ( cpa ) ,  and  atypical form of cpp.4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 however , a case combining with these four features  adult , dense calcification , atypical form , and cpa  is considered to be extremely rare ; such a case has never been encountered among the 8,540 skull base tumors on which the senior author ( t.f . ) has operated in the past 20 years . \n we report an adult case of densely calcified , atypical cpp originated from the cpa without connection to the forth ventricle . \n a 41-year - old man presented with a chief complaint of headache , dizziness , and difficulty with gait that had been gradually worsening for 8 months . \n neurological examination revealed blurred vision , nystagmus with lateral gaze , and mild right facial weakness . \n intermittent difficulty with balance and gait were also present ; however , no motor weakness was observed . \n computed tomography ( ct ) of the head without contrast revealed a high - density multilobular mass in the right cpa causing mass effect and slight ventricular enlargement ( fig . \n magnetic resonance ( mr ) images demonstrated a trilobed solid mass that measured 4.1 cm in maximum diameter ( fig . \n the mass was extra - axial in location and revealed isointensity on both t1-weighted images ( t1-wi ) and t2-weighted images ( t2-wi ) . \n ct and mr images did not reveal any connection between the tumor and the fourth ventricle . \n the surface of the tumor was roughly irregular and looked grayish pink . since the tumor was friable , gelatinous , vascular , and adherent to surrounding structures , it was hard to separate from cranial nerves . \n cranial nerves vi , vii , viii , ix , and x were enveloped in the tumor mass , which included calcification . \n the patient was discharged after recovery from the dysphagia by appropriate rehabilitation . \n computed tomography without contrast revealed a high - density multilobular mass in the right cerebellopontine angle . \n magnetic resonance images demonstrated a trilobed solid mass that was in an extra - axial location . \n the tumor revealed isointensity on both t1-weighted images ( upper left ) and t2-weighted images ( upper right ) . \n homogeneous intense enhancement was identified ( axial in lower left , sagittal in lower right ) . \n cpp reported in this article primarily occurred in the cpa with close proximity to the foramen of luschka lacking continuity of the fourth ventricle . \n the majority of choroid plexus tumors ( cpts ) originate in the ventricular system , 43 to 67% in the lateral ventricle , 24 to 39% in the fourth ventricle , and 9.5 to 11% in the third ventricle , respectively.8 \n 9 the common site of origin differs in each pediatric and adult group . in the pediatric age group , \n 60 to 80% of such tumors occur in the lateral ventricle , especially in the trigone , because the vascular stalk of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle is usually attached to the inferior portion of the trigone . on the other hand , \n most cpp in adults occurs within the fourth ventricle.9 \n 10 \n 11 a small number of the tumors have been reported to be located in extraventricular regions , the cpa , or the cerebellar hemisphere or the suprasellar cistern.8 \n 10 \n 12 cpp within the cpa was first described by cushing in 1917.13 to date , cpp within the cpa has been reported in 7 to 9% of all cpts and is most exclusively found in adults.9 \n 11 \n 14 \n 15 it is divided into two categories according to the origin of the tumor ; one is primary extraventricular cpts and the other is a result of a direct extension of fourth ventricular tumors through the foramen of luschka.15 because the tumor of our case revealed no connection from the fourth ventricle , it is considered to originate from small choroid tufts that normally project from each recess at the foramen luschka into the cpa or from ectopic choroidal islets  unconnected  with the choroid plexus.16 \n  the cpp of our case indicated dense calcification with ventricular enlargement . \n the bulbous tufts extended from the fourth ventricular choroid plexus through the foramen of luschka have been known as the bochdalek flower basket , which could be identified in 75% on ct and 96% on mr imaging.17 calcification of the region was found in 38% on normal imaging anatomy.17 in pathological states , calcification of cpp was reported in 4.1% on plain skull radiographs and 23.8% on ct examinations in patients of all \n 9 the feature of the calcification was commonly described as a stippled or patchy configuration that may include some degrees of hemorrhage.8 \n 9 \n 10 dense calcification was exceptionally reported by sarkar et al.2 the rate of hydrocephalus in association with cpp is 90% and the rate increases up to 100% in malignant cpps.8 the cause of hydrocephalus was considered a combination of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) overproduction ( four to five times that in healthy persons ) , obstruction of csf pathways by the tumor mass , impaired csf absorption , increased protein content of csf around the tumor , subarachnoid scarring or granulations related to recurrent bleeding from the tumor , elevated intraventricular pulse pressure , and adhesions around the exit foramina of the fourth ventricle caused by highly proteinaceous or hemorrhagic csf.2 \n 10 \n 18 the finding of tumor calcification in the cpa generally required consideration of differential diagnosis with papillary or psammomatous meningioma , melanotic schwannoma , and myxopapillary ependymoma . among these tumors , \n association of ventricular enlargement with the finding of calcification might suggest the possible presence of cpts . \n gross total removal was performed in our case of atypical cpp , although the tumor adhered to adjacent structures . in the 2007 world health organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system \n , cpts are classified into cpp as grade i , atypical cpp as grade ii , and choroid plexus carcinoma ( cpc ) as grade iii . among cpts , \n total removal of cpts is recommended and seems to be feasible since a significant prognostic factor was relevant to the extent of tumor removal , and no definitive evidence of the beneficial effect of radiotherapy has been reported6 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 . however , it is not always possible because of tumor bleeding and firm adhesion to adjacent structures , especially cranial nerves . \n the rate of complete resection of benign cpp was 80% and the 5-year survival rate indicated is nearly 100% . \n the majority of survivors are neurologically intact.19 because of the good prognosis , the preservation of cranial nerve functions should be primarily considered in surgery for benign cpp . as for the atypical cpp \n , the rate of total removal was decreased to 50 from 63%.11 \n 21 atypical cpp showed a recurrence rate of 29% , which was much higher than the 6% seen in cpp . \n in addition , seeding within the central nervous system , spontaneous pulmonary metastasis , or rapid regrowth of atypical cpp were also reported.7 \n 22 \n 23 total or gross total removal should be advocated , especially in malignant cpts even though the tumor encases the cranial nerves . \n the finding of calcification in the cpa should suggest the possible presence of cpp , especially if ventricular enlargement is present .",

         "many studies over the past 15 years have focused on discovering solvents that help promote efficient cc bond formation under benign reaction conditions . \n new solvents in dielsalder(2 ) and barbier reactions have been sought to help streamline the one - pot transformations further , reducing synthetic steps and organic waste . \n polar media often accelerate reactions of this type which has led to the use of water as an acceptable solvent for such organic conversions . \n recent contributions from our laboratory to this field have centered on coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes and allyl or propargyl halides under barbier conditions to form homoallylic and homopropargylic propargyl alcohols . \n these compounds find wide use as synthetic templates and show a propensity for oxy - cope rearrangements ( scheme 1 ) . \n the use of -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) , coupled with a propargyl aldehyde should offer an easy route into formation of enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures ( scheme 2 ) . \n previous studies revealed that formation of 2 or 3 under indium - promoted barbier conditions is solvent dependent . \n use of an organic solvent for the coupling reaction results in a mixture of 2 and 3 while the use of water as a solvent yields 2 as the sole product . \n it is possible that water protonates the coupled product to form 2 quickly , quenching the alkoxide intermediate , thereby suppressing the possible oxy - cope pathway shown in scheme 1 . \n it may also be possible that the increased polarity of the solvent itself stabilizes the anion formed upon coupling , thus raising the relative rate of cope rearrangement in this system . with a less polar , aprotic solvent , \n the anion will not be quenched , nor will it be stabilized to the same extent as witnessed in water . \n a combination of these phenomena may be why an oxy - cope rearrangement occurs under less polar conditions , forming product 3 ( scheme 1 ) . \n a coupling reaction between 1 and 4 ( scheme 2 ) was conducted under aqueous conditions to form 2 ( y = sph ) , with good regioselectivity ; however , the rate of this reaction is surprisingly slow . \n although reactions of the type shown in scheme 1 are reported in the literature to be accelerated by polar solvents such as water , coupling reactions between 1 and 4 , as shown in scheme 2 , are quite slow . indeed , \n when water is used as the solvent , reactions often require 1036 h for completion . \n this oil has a density greater than that of water so it is presumed to be an organometallic species formed by interaction of the indium metal with the halide species . \n isolation of the oil followed by workup in an acidic thf / h2o mixture leads to isolation of propargylphenyl sulfide and , to a smaller extent , the aldehyde . \n we surmise that low solubility of this organometallic complex leads to poor reagent mixing , slowing the barbier coupling under aqueous conditions . \n second , indium - promoted coupling reactions conducted in water become more acidic as the reaction proceeds . \n we believe it is possible that the aldehyde is in equilibrium with its corresponding hydrate species , reducing the electrophilicity of the carbon center . \n a combination of these two reasons would lead to a decrease in the rate of reaction between 1 and 4 when conducted in an aqueous solvent . \n the reaction proceeds more quickly ( 812 h ) in dmf , a less polar solvent , due to better solubility of all reagents , however , a mixture of 2 and 3 was isolated . \n it was originally expected that a mixture of water and dmf would lead to faster reaction times while still maintaining regiocontrol of product formation . the use of a water / dmf solvent system , however , resulted in a mixture of products with water constituting up to 50% v / v of the solvent system . \n when water exceeds 50% v / v of the solvent system , only product 2 is isolated , but the rate of reaction slows perceptively once again . to help expedite this reaction sequence , \n we began a search for solvent with polarity similar to , or greater than that of water . \n it was expected that an extremely polar organic solvent would promote the same type of acceleration normally witnessed in barbier couplings carried out under aqueous conditions . \n an organic solvent could also help solubilize the intermediate and reduce possible formation of the hydrate species , thus allowing for a faster coupling reaction to occur . \n if increased polarity stabilizes the anion formed by coupling of 1 and 4 , oxy - cope rearrangement should also be suppressed . with a dielectric constant of 186.9 at 25 c , significantly greater than that of water ( 78.37(7 ) ) , and dmf ( 38.3(7b ) ) , \n n - methylformamide ( nmf ) has found occasional use in previous reactions requiring polar organic solvents ; however , it has historically found more widespread use as an organic reagent . with a pka of approximately 24,(7d ) \n nmf is reactive under a range of organometallic reagent conditions , limiting its use as a solvent . \n indium - promoted coupling reactions , however , have been shown to be accelerated under aqueous conditions,(1 ) and the relative acidity of nmf , being higher than that of water , should not hinder the proposed barbier couplings proposed within this paper . \n we were especially intrigued by the fact that the dielectric constant of nmf increases to 220 as the temperature is lowered from 25 to 0 c . \n we were interested in examining what effect the increase in dielectric constant at lower temperature could have on a barbier - style reaction of the type shown in scheme 2 among others . \n this paper reports on the use of nmf in barbier - style reactions with a focus on rates of reaction , stereochemistry , and its use to form enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures.(9 ) \n although nmf has characteristics similar to those of dmf , it also has characteristics similar to water , such as a polar xh bond.(7 ) thus , having found a very polar solvent with properties similar to both water and organic systems , we hypothesized that the 1,2-coupling product could be formed in high yield under short reaction times . \n a series of reactions was set up to test this hypothesis . as shown in table 1 , use of either water or \n nmf resulted in formation of the 1,2-product ( 2 ) solely with no trace of 3 detected in the product mixture . \n although the yield of product was moderate to high in either solvent , product formation in reactions conducted in nmf proceeded at a much greater rate . \n we believe that there are two possible reasons behind the rate increase of coupling reactions carried out in nmf . \n the ratio of reagent was as follows : 1.0:1.5:1.1 ( aldehyde / halide / indium ) . \n the reaction was run at 0.1 m with respect to indium . in the lewis acid catalyzed reaction , 10 molar % of the lewis acid was used . \n all species completely dissolved in nmf , unlike what was observed for reactions in water . as such , we believe mixing is much more efficient , allowing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate . \n has also been noted in many literature examples to lead to rate enhancement in indium - promoted barbier reactions . \n we believe a mixture of better solubility coupled with greater solvent polarity results in an additive effect toward increasing the rate of reactions conducted in nmf when compared to water . \n h - bonding capabilities of nmf may explain the greater regioselectivity for reactions conducted in nmf when compared to those observed in dmf and thf ; however , the h - bonding capacity of nmf is much lower than that of water.(7d ) increased solvent polarity , thus increasing the stability of the intermediate anion and raising the relative energy of the oxy - cope rearrangement , may seem more likely at this time . in an effort to exclude the solvent as a direct participant in intermediate formation when nmf is used , nmr spectroscopy studies were performed to determine if a possible hemiaminal or imminium species was forming in situ ( figure 1 ) . \n the imminium functionality carries a positive charge and would increase the electrophilicity of the reactive carbon . \n mixing of 1 and nmf under sonication for periods of up to 24 h , however , revealed the presence of only 1 and nmf by nmr spectroscopy . possible formation of hemiaminal or imminium species . the presence or absence of a lewis acid has shown to help control stereoselectivity in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions . \n previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the addition of indium(iii ) chloride as a lewis acid favors formation of the syn - product in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions between 4 and aldehyde functional groups . in the absence of the lewis acid , \n the anti - product is favored ( figure 2).(5b ) it was our hope that similar effects would be witnessed in the present system , especially while using nmf as the reaction solvent , and we were pleased to see this trend continue . \n absence of a lewis acid in the reagent mixture favored a nonchelated pathway , leading to formation of anti-2 . \n use of indium chloride to control stereochemistry.(5b ) the presence of a lewis acid in the reaction mixture favored a chelated pathway , leading to formation of syn-2 ( figure 3 ) . \n diastereoselectivities were determined either by direct measurement of vicinal coupling constants in the hydroxyl sulfide or by corresponding conversion to the epoxide compounds as shown in figure 4.(11 ) general j values for hydroxyl sulfides and epoxide structures . \n entries 1 , 5 , and 13 ( table 1 ) describe reactions run in nmf in the absence of a lewis acid . \n good anti - selectivity is witnessed with ratios as high as 15:85 ( syn / anti ) . in all cases , with \n the exception of r = phenyl , systems , with and without incl3 , run in nmf gave better selectivity than systems run in water . \n both systems showed poor selectivity when r = tms for reasons of which we are not quite sure . when incl3 was added as a lewis acid , the chelated route was favored in ratios as high as 90:10 ( syn : anti , entry 15 ) . \n n - methylformamide was shown to increase the rate of reaction compared with water and offered better stereocontrol in the systems studied . \n enediyne and epoxydiyne functionalities contain either a ( z)-3-ene-1,5-diyne or ( z)-3-epoxy-1,5-diyne unit which leads to their noted activity.(9 ) these unique functional groups cyclize to form a p - benzyne- or p - benzyne - like intermediate that interacts with dna by abstracting hydrogen.(9 ) the dna diradical then either couples with itself , or cleaves , stopping replication . \n natural product enediyne and epoxydiynes have found use as anticarcinogenic compounds.(9 ) this area of study is slowed , however , by complicated access into the skeletal systems required.(9 ) literature procedures that find use in epoxy alkyne formation such as halohydrin cylization,(12)m - cpba,(13 ) or oxone(14 ) have been shown to be successful , but limited examples are known with these systems at present . under the barbier coupling conditions described in this paper , formation of compound 2 offers an efficient and controlled method for the formation of either an enediyne or epoxydiyne skeletal structure under benign conditions by allowing easy conversion to either the cis - epoxydiyne ( from syn-2 , scheme 3 ) or the cis - enediyne ( from anti-2 , scheme 4 ) . \n facile synthesis of epoxydiyne and enediyne functional groups under the reported conditions would allow for their use as template structures in organic synthesis , opening access to more sophisticated units for further exploration . in the following pages , we describe the transformation of 1 into either an epoxydiyne ( 5 ) or enediyne ( 6 ) skeletal structure in two steps with high regio- and stereocontrol using nmf as a new solvent to form 2 under barbier conditions , followed by a one - step transformation to yield either 5 or 6 . as shown in scheme 3 , syn-2 can adopt the correct conformation to form a cis - oxirane upon reaction with either me3obf4 or tloet . \n conversion of the hydroxy sulfide starting material ( 2 ) to the epoxyalkyne product ( 5 ) was quite successful as shown in table 2 . in all cases , \n this fact is worth mentioning as barbier reactions with propargyl halides can lead to rearrangement of the organometallic intermediate into an allenyl product . \n reagent 4 has been previously shown to offer one of the few examples of a barbier reaction with a propargyl halide where rearrangement does not occur.(5b ) use of tloet(17 ) gave yields similar to that of me3obf4(18 ) in all cases of oxirane formation , with stereoselectivity preserved under both sets of conditions . \n use of the anti-2 allows formation of the ( e)-alkene ( the alkyne functional groups are cis to each other ) functional group by the pathway shown in scheme 4 . \n formation of the enediyne product was possible under slightly acidic conditions . a catalytic amount of p - tsoh is added to anti-2 in a mixture of water and thf ( 10% water ) with stirring for 37 h. the reaction was also conducted under basic conditions after transformation of the oh group to a tosylate . \n yields were quite low under basic conditions , presumably due to the competing acidity of the alkynyl proton , leading to decomposition and side product formation . due to low yields , \n results of the acid - catalyzed conversion of anti-2 to ( e)-6 are shown in table 3 . \n a slight amount of isomerization was witnessed under acidic conditions ( about 3% of the product mixture ) , but overall , good stereocontrol was realized in these conversions , allowing for easy entry into the cis - enediyne ( ( e)-alkene ) skeletal structure in a two - step sequence . \n the assignment of e- and z - isomers was made by comparison of the -vinyl proton shift . \n alignment of the -vinyl proton and the heteroatom cis to each other gives rise to a lower field proton resonance than trans alignment of these two groups ( figure 5).(19 ) the assignments for the enediyne products are compared correctly with the stereochemistry of compounds 2 and 3 within this study . \n coupled with the original indium - promoted barbier reaction , the transformation of starting materials 1 and 4 into enediyne or epoxydiyne compounds proceeded in two steps in an overall 6080% overall yield , offering an efficient , benign , and good - yielding formation of these important skeletal structures . \n the use of n - methylformamide is shown to be a nice alternative to aqueous conditions in indium promoted coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes ( 1 ) and -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) . \n this paper introduces the use of nmf as s viable solvent in a barbier coupling reaction , revealing increased rates and better selectivity when compared to reactions conducted in water and other organic

         "osseointegrated implants are a practical alternative to traditional prosthodontics ; however , designing an implant - supported prosthesis with function and esthetics is a challenge . \n malaligned implants often complicate the clinical laboratory procedures employed for fabrication of superstructures . due to improper load distribution , \n a stent is an appliance used for radiographic evaluation of height and width of the available bone during treatment planning for implant placement or during surgical procedures to provide site for optimum implant placement . \n the variable type of stents includes vaccuform or acrylic resin templates adapted over duplicated casts of diagnostic wax - up . \n these include plastic or metal tubes and channels in acrylic resin that dictate the position of implants . \n stents should be made of transparent material , stable and rigid when in position , should cover enough teeth to stabilize its position , and when no teeth are present , stents should extend onto unreflected soft tissue regions . with the use of computed tomography ( ct ) and computer added designing ( cad)/ computer added machining ( cam ) technology \n , it is now possible to construct a surgical implant stent that would allow the clinician to predetermine implant locations virtually and surgically place them without reflecting a tissue flap.[58 ] but the surgical stents prepared with ct and cad / cam technology are very much more cost effective than a conventional surgical stent and require enough time and special center and/or laboratories for their fabrication and later on their correction , if required . in this study \n , we used the conventional surgical stents to evaluate their efficacy in determining the position and diameter of implants . \n the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and clinical precision of conventional surgical stent protocol for optimum installation of dental implants in terms of position and diameter . \n the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and clinical precision of conventional surgical stent protocol for optimum installation of dental implants in terms of position and diameter . \n the study was conducted in the out - patient department of prosthodontics and dental material sciences in collaboration with department of oral and maxillofacial surgery , faculty of dental sciences , csmmu , lucknow . \n patients were treated in this study with the conventional surgical stents ; all the implants were placed to the desired depth as planned in virtual implant planning . \n all the patients ( 45 patients for whom 89 implants were placed at different sites ) [ figures 1 , 2 ] visiting the department of prosthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery for implant supported prosthesis placement and who followed the standard inclusion criteria for placement of implants were included in the study . \n first of all , diagnostic cast of the patients was made and acrylic teeth / tooth were waxed - up [ figure 3 ] . then , the impression of that waxed - up cast was taken and poured to reproduce another cast with the missing teeth / tooth replaced by dental stone . \n then , mesiodistal and buccolingual markings were drawn over these teeth / tooth to find a center point on the occlusal surface [ figure 4 ] . \n later on , after applying the separating media over these regions and filling the undercuts with wax , transparent self - curing material was applied at the teeth to be replaced along with some adjacent area antero - posteriorly , which confers the stability to the stent during implant placement [ figure 5 ] . \n the holes were drilled in the stent so formed at the center point for the assessment of the diameter and position of implant and filled with gutta percha [ figure 6 ] . \n this stent was placed in the mouth and radiograph was taken to evaluate the position of gutta percha . \n the efficacy of stents was then evaluated at the time of surgical exposure for implant placement and after the surgery , with the help of radiographs [ figures 7 , 8 ] . \n intraoral view of the patient radiograph of the patients waxed - up missing teeth missing teeth replaced by dental stone in the cast with markings stent made of transparent material stent in place with gutta percha filled in holes post - operative radiograph philip j. described a technique to construct a surgical guide on mounted diagnostic casts . \n he also used these mounted casts to determine whether sufficient space exists for a fixed cantilevered implant prosthesis . \n murat c cehreli suggested the fabrication of a bilaminar dual - purpose stent that facilitates implant placement with improved verification of implant positioning . \n the outer lamina is designed for use in the computed tomography ( ct ) evaluation using radiopaque markers . \n yen - chen ku presented a simple method of fabricating a vacuum - formed matrix filled with clear acrylic resin and a gutta - percha marker . \n the matrix can be used as not only a radiopaque marker for evaluation but also a surgical guide during the surgical stage for single implant therapy . \n roger a. solow showed that a radiographic - surgical template can facilitate consultation with a surgeon and patient , when implant - supported restorations are planned . a template that provides radiographic evaluation of the implant site and precise or modified surgical placement \n kivanc akea described a modified surgical stent that serves as a guide to proper mesiodistal paralleling of dental implants . \n he also used these mounted casts to determine whether sufficient space exists for a fixed cantilevered implant prosthesis . \n murat c cehreli suggested the fabrication of a bilaminar dual -

surgical healing , fewer post - operative complications and increased comfort and satisfaction for the patient . \n the possibility of displacement of stent during implant surgery was minimized by extension of the stent antero - posteriorly to cover enough area over the teeth / tooth present adjacent to edentulous area . in cases where no teeth are present , \n stabilization of stent was achieved by extending it over the unreflected areas like retromolar regions . \n this study shows the extreme accuracy of this conventional surgical stent . if each step of this protocol is followed precisely , it is possible to deliver an optimum implant installation in terms of position and diameter and later on function at a very much reduced rate and time , as taken in ct and cad / cam technology which are the most accepted methods",
         "aim : demand from implant patients for quality and efficient treatment is increasing . \n fortunately dental implant treatment is evolving with patients expectations.materials and methods : the study comprised of 45 patients for whom 89 implants were placed at different sites . \n efficacy of the stents is evaluated in determining the position and diameter of the implants.conclusion:this study shows the extreme accuracy of this surgical stents in implant installation in terms of position and diameter .",

         "type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic -cells , primarily mediated by t lymphocytes , resulting in insulin deficiency and lifelong exogenous insulin dependence ( 1 ) . \n latent autoimmune diabetes in adults ( lada ) is a subtype of autoimmune diabetes , but the progression of autoimmune -cell destruction is slow ; therefore , patients with lada are not insulin dependent at the initial phase ( at least 6 months ) of disease onset \n . clinical manifestation of lada shares the features of classical t1d and type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) ( 2 ) . t1d , lada , and t2d present a spectrum of diabetes . \n they range from patients with classic childhood t1d characterized by autoimmune - mediated destruction of -cells with the lowest c - peptide levels to age - related exacerbation of glucose tolerance with the highest bmi seen in t2d ( 3 ) . \n furthermore , patients with lada have susceptibility genes for both t1d and t2d ( 4 ) , suggesting that lada lies between t1d and t2d . \n b cells infiltrate the islets of young nod mice , the commonly used mouse model for human t1d , and play a role in the initiation of -cell destruction by the autoimmune response ( 5 ) . \n studies have shown that marginal zone b ( mzb ) cells and follicular b ( fob ) cells can effectively activate cd4 t cells and facilitate their proliferation by serving as important antigen - presenting cells , especially as antigen - specific antigen - presenting cells ( 6,7 ) . \n b - cell  targeted therapy has been shown to delay the fall of c - peptide levels in patients with recent - onset t1d ( 8) . \n clinical trials have identified b cells as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and reversal of t1d . \n b - cell  targeted therapy also has been successfully used in treating other autoimmune diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis ( 9 ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( 10 ) , and multiple sclerosis ( 11 ) . \n moreover , studies have shown that b cells are important in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity ( 12 ) . a subset of b cells expressing cd19cd5cd1d , which have a regulatory function in infection , inflammation , and autoimmune disease , recently has been identified . \n these regulatory b cells can regulate t - cell responses and inhibit inflammation in an interleukin-10 ( il-10)dependent manner ( 1316 ) . \n the maturation and expansion of b10 cells require il-21 and cd40 signals both in vivo and ex vivo ( 17,18 ) . \n considerable evidence shows that patients with autoimmune diabetes have altered frequencies of circulating immune cells , including t cells ( 19 ) , dendritic cells ( 20 ) , natural killer cells ( 21,22 ) , and neutrophils ( 23 ) . \n although studies have reported no significant change in total b cells in peripheral blood of patients with t1d ( 21,24 ) , little is known about b - cell subpopulations with distinct immune functions that may play a role in the diabetes spectrum of t1d , lada , and t2d . \n we hypothesized that an altered phenotype of b - cell subsets is associated with autoimmune diabetes . \n this study investigated a change of peripheral b - cell subsets in patients with t1d , lada , and t2d compared with healthy control subjects . \n the results show altered frequencies of various b - cell subsets associated with autoimmune diabetes . \n two hundred fifty - eight patients with t1d ( n = 81 , mean diabetes duration 3.1  3.5 years ) , lada ( n = 82 , 6.1  5.9 years ) , or t2d ( n = 95 , 3.0  3.7 years ) and 218 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance ( ngt ) ( table 1 ) were enrolled in the current study from the second xiangya hospital of central south university ( changsha , hunan , china ) . \n diabetes was diagnosed according to world health organization ( who ) criteria ( 25 ) . \n diagnosis of t1d was based on acute - onset ketosis or ketoacidosis with immediate insulin replacement therapy ;

however , we did not find a negative correlation between total b cells and age , as previously reported ( 24,31 ) . \n the current study went further than the examination of the frequency of total b cells , focusing on b - cell subsets with distinct immunological functions . \n of note , we found that patients with t1d or lada had an increased frequency of mzb cells but decreased frequency of fob cells compared with control subjects with ngt and patients with t2d . in all groups , we found that fcp was negatively associated with mzb cells but positively associated with fob cells . \n attanavanich and kearney ( 6 ) reported that mzb cells were more effective at activating naive cd4 t cells than fob cells . \n mzb cells in nod mice were also shown to be important antigen - presenting cells for the activation of t cells in pancreatic - draining lymph nodes ( 32 ) . given the negative correlation between mzb cells and fcp , it is possible that mzb cells may promote -cell destruction in patients with t1d or lada . \n decreased frequency of fob cells in the circulation of patients with t1d and lada suggests that some fob cells migrated from the blood to the pancreas or the draining lymph nodes as a result of the local inflammatory response . \n along with the disease progression , more immune cells are known to infiltrate to the islets of both nod mice and patients with t1d ( 5,33 ) , but the patients with t1d in the current study have a relatively long history of diabetes ( 3.1 years ) . \n thus , fob cells appear to be more important in initial rather than established pancreatic -cell autoimmunity ( 34 ) . \n we showed that patients with t2d and lada more frequently had t2-mzp b cells than control subjects with ngt , which associates with parameters of blood pressure , lipidemia , and glycemia but not with hba1c or fcp . \n these observations are consistent with a previous study showing that glycemia and lipidemia are associated with immune cells ( 35 ) . another interesting finding was the decrease of b10 cell frequency in all types of diabetes , being the lowest in t1d . \n whether this phenotype is mediated through a common mechanism or different ones is not clear . \n what is clear is that immune mechanisms are involved and that more studies , especially functional studies , are required . \n although b cells are generally acknowledged for their function in humoral immune response by producing antibodies , they also have been demonstrated to play an immunoregulatory role in the prevention of autoimmune disease by producing il-10 and downregulating t - cell responses ( 13,14,36 ) . \n the observed b10 cell reduction could contribute to the breakdown of self - tolerance that leads to -cell destruction in patients with t1d ( 24 ) or lada . \n antigen - activated il-10producing b cells may selectively inhibit autoreactive t - cell responses to islet - specific antigen to maintain self - tolerance , and hyperglycemic nod mice and patients with t1d lack this population of regulatory b cells ( 37 ) . \n in the clinical trial where b cells in patients with new - onset t1d were depleted , the patients showed a transient remission ( 8) . \n however , blanket targeting of all b cells , as used in the clinical trial and in treating other autoimmune disorders , needs to be improved by selectively deleting pathogenic b cells while preserving regulatory b cells to promote tolerance . \n our preclinical study showed that more regulatory b cells were regenerated after b - cell deletion in an animal model ( 38 ) . \n furthermore , studies have shown that patients with long - standing t2d could have a secondary autoimmune response toward islet -cells ( 39 ) . \n the reduction of b10 regulatory cells might contribute to the dysregulation of immune response in t2d . \n a functional study on il-10producing b cells and further phenotyping will be the goal of future work . in the current study , \n although we currently can not identify a specific subset that could be used for diagnostic purposes , the results strongly imply that the change of b - cell subtypes is related to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes . \n therefore , it is important to reconsider the approach of b - cell  targeted therapy in patients with t1d and aim to selectively remove pathogenic b cells but promote regulatory b cells . in summary , \n the current data demonstrate distinct differences in the frequencies of peripheral b - cell subsets in t1d and lada , which are associated with islet function and glycemia . \n the findings support the notion that these immunological alterations are involved in loss of self - tolerance and -cell destruction . \n the findings also suggest that , similar to regulatory t - cell therapy , transfusion of ex vivo expanded autologous b10 cells might open a new and effective therapeutic strategy in treating autoimmune diabetes . \n ",
         "objectiveb lymphocytes play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes . \n we hypothesized that the altered b - cell subset phenotype is associated with autoimmune diabetes.research design and methodspatients with type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) ( n = 81 ) , latent autoimmune diabetes in adults ( lada ) ( n = 82 ) , or type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) ( n = 95 ) and healthy control subjects ( n = 218 ) with normal glucose tolerance ( ngt ) were recruited . \n we determined the percentage of circulating b - lymphocyte subsets , including cd19+cd23cd21 + ( marginal zone b [ mzb ] ) , cd19+cd23+cd21 ( follicular b [ fob ] ) , and cd19+cd5+cd1dhi ( interleukin-10producing regulatory b [ b10 ] ) cells by flow cytometry.resultspatients with t1d or lada had increased percentages of mzb cells and decreased percentages of fob cells compared with healthy control subjects with ngt and patients with t2d . \n moreover , patients with t1d showed the lowest frequency of b10 cells compared with patients with lada or t2d , whereas healthy control subjects expressed the highest frequency of b10 cells . \n of note , the frequency of mzb cells was negatively associated and the frequency of fob cells was positively associated with fasting c - peptide ( fcp ) . \n the frequency of b10 cells was positively correlated with fcp and negatively correlated with hemoglobin a1c.conclusionsthe data show that patients with t1d or lada express an altered frequency of b - cell subsets , which is associated with islet function and glycemia . \n these findings suggest that b lymphocytes may be involved in loss of self - tolerance and -cell destruction and could be used as a biomarker and potential target for immunological intervention .",

         "according to numerous estimations , 15% to 29% of patients with cataract have 1.5 diopters ( d ) of refractive astigmatism.1,2 cataract surgeons usually prefer to treat cataract and correct refractive ( spherical and astigmatic ) disorders at the time of the surgery . \n corneal incision ( astigmatic keratotomy ) and peripheral corneal relaxing incisions ( pcris ) were performed to treat these disorders.3,4 the main drawbacks of these approaches are that the outcome depends on multiple factors as the patient s age , the depth and length of the incision , complications related to wound healing , epithelial defects , or induction of dry - eye symptoms . \n these parameters affect the visual outcome in a unpredictable way so the corneal incisions are not considered a reliable method for astigmatism correction . \n toric intraocular lens ( iols ) implantation was introduced in the 1990 s as an option for astigmatism correction in cataract patients . \n initially they presented the disadvantage of postoperative rotation that decreased the visual outcome.58 new toric iol designs ( acrysof   toric iol ; alcon , fort worth , tx ) , approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) at the end of 2005 , have been found to be more stable and appear to be the preferred iol for correcting preexisting astigmatism in conjunction with cataract surgery.9,10 the acrysof   iols are available in three options : t3 , t4 , and t5 of astigmatic correction 1.5 , 2.25 , 3.00 d , respectively ( at the iol plane ) . \n the aim of this study is to report the clinical results of acrysof   toric iols implantation for preexisting astigmatism correction and compare the postoperative rotation of the iols one and six months postoperatively . \n this prospective study included eyes that had cataract surgery at the papageorgiou general hospital , thessaloniki , greece , between may 2008 and december 2008 . \n the study was conducted according to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and patients gave informed consent after the nature and intent of the study had been fully explained to them . \n inclusion criteria were : cataract , age 70 years or younger , and preoperative regular corneal astigmatism greater than 1.00 d. exclusion criteria were : glaucoma , corneal disease , previous corneal or intraocular surgery , macular degeneration or retinopathy , and history of ocular inflammation . \n each patient had a complete ophthalmologic examination , including visual acuity ( va ) , slit - lamp examination , intraocular pressure ( iop ) measurement , and dilated fundus examination . \n topography ( magellan mapper ; nidek technologies , padova , italy ) , automated refractometry ( rk600 ; reichert , inc . \n , depew , ny ) , and ultrasonic immersion biometry ( ocuscan rxp ; alcon ) were performed to determine the appropriate iol spherical power . \n cylindrical power and axis placement to achieve emmetropia were calculated using an online toric iol calculator program ( available from http://www.acrysoforiccalculator.com/ ) . \n the 0180 axis was marked with the patient in a sitting position to avoid cyclotorsion using the nuijts / lane preoperative toric reference corneal marker ( ae-2791tbl ; asico , westmont , il ) ( figure 1 ) . \n intraoperatively , the desired implantation axis was marked using an intra - op toric axis marker ii ( ae-2794 ; asico ) ( figure 2 ) . \n a foldable iol was implanted in the capsular bag through a 2.75 mm limbal incision on 110. the toric iol was injected with a monarch - ii injector ( alcon ) and placed around 1015 off axis before the ophthalmic viscosurgical device ( sodium hyaluronate 1% ) was removed . \n after ophthalmic viscosurgical device removal , the iol was rotated to its final position by exactly aligning the toric reference marks with the limbal implantation axis marks . \n all surgeries were performed by the same experienced surgeon ( it ) using topical anesthesia and a standard divide - and - conquer phacoemulsification technique . because of the intraoperative marker design and the pen mark fading during the operation in several cases , it was difficult to assess the proper alignment of the iol after its placement . because of this difficulty , an image was captured from the real - time streaming recording of the surgery and was assessed blindly by a second operator using a commercially available software ( screen protractor ; iconico , ny , usa ) ( unpublished data ) . to overcome this difficulty we consider that the use of the marker set consisting of beveled degree gauge ( ae-1590 ; asico ) and maloney astigmatism axis marker ( ae-2741 ; asico ) is more appropriate for the whole procedure because it allows maximum visibility . \n the on - screen assessment of the axis remains a useful tool for postoperative evaluation of the iol location ( figure 3 ) . \n measurements of visual acuity ( using the snellen opto - type at a six - meter distance ) , iop , and comprehensive slit lamp examination were performed at one - day and one- and six - month postoperative visits . at the one- and six - month follow - up \n , a digital photograph and corneal topography ( only at the one - month visit ) were obtained to estimate the postoperative rotation of the iol using the software tools mentioned above ( figure 1 ) . \n outcomes of interest included uncorrected va , cylindrical astigmatism power before and after iol implantation , and the possible rotation of the iol one and six months after the operation ( when the initial desired place was at 0 ) . \n absolute values of the rotation used for the analysis after detecting rotation was not under investigation . \n completed data forms were analyzed with microsoft excel 2007 ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa ) and spss software ( version 16.0 ;

         "song is a complex , learned motor skill that involves the precise coordination of vocal and respiratory musculature in order to produce highly stereotyped renditions of a memorized song model . \n two pathways contributed to this behavior are identified in the songbird forebrain : the motor pathway that is required throughout life for normal song production , and the anterior forebrain pathway ( afp ) which is necessary for song learning and plasticity [ 13 ] . \n hvc ( used as the proper name ) is the beginning nucleus of both pathways and projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( ra ) and afp . \n the motor pathway is from hvc to ra , and then ra projects to brainstem nuclei controlling the vocal and respiratory muscles . during song , ra neurons in adult birds generate a highly stereotyped sequence of bursts [ 5 , 6 ] and also receive input from lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium ( lman ) , the output nucleus of afp . \n notably , recordings from lman neurons projecting to ra revealed highly variable spiking activity across song renditions , suggesting that lman may act as a source of variability . \n these results indicate that synaptic activity in lman - ra synaptic transmission is crucial to song plasticity [ 8 , 9 ] , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . it has been observed that ra received excitatory glutamatergic inputs from hvc and lman . \n the former is mediated by a mixture of n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) and -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic - acid- ( ampa- ) type receptors [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] , and the latter is mediated almost exclusively by nmda - type receptors . \n lman - ra synaptic transmission is necessary for the variability of song in adult zebra finch , suggesting that the activity of nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses might induce the activity pattern change of ra neurons and change the bursts that control the vocal and respiratory muscles . \n the control of gain , which refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input , is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions [ 1215 ] . \n gain control is achieved through a divisive process and is observed as a change in the slope of the input - output relationship . \n such gain changes are frequently observed in the responses of cortical neurons and are thought to play an important role in neural computations . \n modulations of gain have been observed in the enhancement of neural responses by attention [ 12 , 16 ] and can also be induced pharmacologically . in a neuron model , \n nmda receptors caused such membrane potential fluctuations between a hyperpolarized down - state and a depolarized up - state , which may gate the information and gain modulation . \n here , we test the gain change of ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to selectively activate nmda receptors , using whole - cell current clamp recording in adult male zebra finch slices . \n brain slices were prepared from adult male zebra finches ( taeniopygia guttata ) ( > 90 days old ) obtained from commercial suppliers as previously described [ 19 , 20 ] . \n brains were dissected into ice - cold , oxygenated ( 95% o2 and 5% co2 ) slice solution . \n slice solution consists of ( in mm ) sucrose 248 , kcl 5 , nahco3   28 , glucose 10 , mgso47h2o 1.3 , and nah2po4h2o 1.26 [ 21 , 22 ] . \n coronal brain slices ( 250  m thick ) containing ra were cut with a vibrating microtome ( ma752 , usa ) and collected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) that had been warmed to 37c and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature . \n slices were allowed to recover in the holding chamber for at least 1.5  h and were equilibrated to room temperature before recordings were made . \n standard acsf consists of ( in mm ) nacl 125 , nahco3 25 , nah2po4h2o 1.27 , kcl 2.5 , mgso47h2o 1.2 , cacl2   2.0 , and glucose 25 and was adjusted with sucrose to a final osmolarity of 350  mos . for recording , \n a slice was transferred to a submerge - type chamber where it was continuously exposed to acsf , saturated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 at room temperature ( 2226c ) at the rate of 2.0  ml / min . \n ra and the surrounding tissues were distinguishable under bx51wi microscope connected with a dic - ir video camera ( olympus , japan ) . at high magnification ( 40x ) , ra neurons were visualized and the recordings were made from healthy cells . \n recording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass ( sutter instruments , usa ) using a flaming - brown puller ( model p-97 , sutter instruments , usa ) and were filled with the pipette solution containing ( in mm ) : k meso4   120 , nacl 5 , hepes 10 , egta 2 , mg - atp 2 , and na3-gtp 0.3 ( ph 7.3 - 7.4 , and 340  mos ) . \n the recording pipettes , which had resistances ranging from 3 to 5  m , were positioned using an integrated motorized control system ( sutter instruments , usa ) . \n the potential changes after application of nmda were corrected during the input - output stimulation protocols . \n the series resistance ( rs ) , between 15  m and 30  m , was compensated using the bridge balance . \n all agents were applied by changing the bath perfusate from standard acsf to modified acsf in which various drugs were simply added . unless indicated otherwise , \n the clampfit 9.2 ( axon instruments , usa ) , mini 6.0 ( synaptosoft inc . , fort lee , nj , usa ) , and originpro 8.0 ( originlab , nothampton , ma , usa ) were used for analysis . \n events with peak amplitude of 50  mv or higher and a rise time of about 0.5  ms were detected automatically , and the results were analyzed with origin pro 8.0 . \n the steady - state spike rate was estimated by counting the number of spikes in 1 second , and the result was plotted versus the intensity of the injected current ( f - i relationship ) . \n the slope of the f - i relationship ( referred to as gain ) was estimated by linear fitting . \n slope parameters were estimated separately for individual neurons and that figures 4 and 5 contain mean slope values averaged for the whole groups of neurons . \n the amplitude of ahp was quantified as the difference between spike threshold and the lowest point of ahp . throughout \n means were compared using paired two - tailed student 's t - test or one - way anova followed by scheffe 's multiple comparison . \n stable whole - cell recordings were obtained in 160  ra projection neurons from 51 adult male zebra finches . \n a neuron with the resting membrane potential < 50  mv and an overshooting action potential was considered viable . \n ra projection neuron was identified by a larger soma , time - dependent inward rectifier induced by hyperpolarizing current and spontaneous regular spike firing or by depolarizing current pulses . \n the input - output relationship was examined by injecting current pulses from 0 to 90  pa with an increment of 10  pa and an interval of 15  s , and they were lasted for 1  s. traces of action potentials in response to 1  s current steps of 10 , 50 , and 90  pa were shown in figure 1(a ) . \n the slopes of the f - i relationships were 246.92  28.00  hz / na before nmda application and increased to 325.49  73.34 \n furthermore , the input resistances were decreased by 20  m nmda in ra projection neurons ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) ( figure 2 ) . \n the afterhyperpolarization ( ahp ) of action potential underlies the modulation of firing frequency . to test the effect of nmda on spike ahp \n comparison of spike shape is shown in figure 3(a ) with 90  pa current injection before and after nmda application . in average \n , there was no significant change in the amplitude of ahp after nmda application ( p > 0.05 , n = 5 ) ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n then we used 50  m dl - apv , a nmda receptor antagonist , to check the selectivity of nmda receptor , and we found that the slope of f - i was not changed by dl - apv alone ( p > 0.05 ) . \n the slope was 255.78  66.69  hz / na and 269.34  56.96  hz / na ( p > 0.05 ) before and after application of 50  m dl - apv ( figure 4 ) , respectively . \n nmda increased the f - i slope 1.32 times ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , the gain modulation induced by nmda was completely abolished by dl - apv ( figure 4 ) . \n previous studies reported that ra projection neurons received glutamatergic and gabaergic inputs [ 23 , 24 ] , which might increase background synaptic activities and modulate the gain of neurons [ 25 , 26 ] . to determine the effect of ampa receptor and gaba receptor on gain modulation by nmda , we examined the effects of nmda in the presence of cnqx , an antagonist for ionotropic glutamate ampa receptors , or / and bicuculline methiodide ( bic ) , a competitive antagonist of gabaa receptors , respectively . \n bic ( 10  m ) accelerated the depolarization by nmda application , but bic alone had little effect on the f - i slope . in the presence of bic , \n the mean initial slopes were 276.46  59.4 and 332.6  40.02  hz / na before and during application of nmda . \n the f - i slope was increased from 1.32 to 1.39 in the presence of nmda and bic ( p > 0.05 ) ; that is , there is an increase of 105.30% over the nmda treatment ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 , unpaired t - test ) . \n cnqx ( 10  m ) decreased the membrane potential and abolished the spontaneous spikes of ra projection neurons sometimes but did not affect the slope of f - i relationship . in the presence of cnqx , \n nmda application hardly changed the f - i slope of ra projection neurons no matter whether bic was present or not ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 ) . \n these results indicated that the ampa receptor - dependent excitability played a crucial role in the gain modulation by nmda . \n the slope was 0.97 or 1.11 in the presence of cnqx or cnqx and bic , respectively . \n the gain induced by nmda was significantly decreased by cnqx ( p < 0.05 ) . \n in this study , we showed that nmda increased the gain of ra projection neurons in adult zebra finch . \n nmda - induced gain increase was limited to firing frequencies less than 40  hz . the effect of nmda on gain was mediated through nmda receptors and might involve synaptic activities . in songbirds , we found that nmda increased the slope of f - i relationship in ra projection neurons , which was completely blocked by dl - apv , a nmda receptor selective antagonist , suggesting that nmda increased the sensitivity of ra projection neurons . \n the pharmacology of nmda receptors involved in gain modulation has been examined in mammals . in cat \n visual cortex , nmda increased the gain of the contrast - response ( c - r ) curve of the neuron in layers ii / iii and v / vi . in mouse , the thalamocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus play a key role in the generation of firing patterns through nmda receptors . \n the neural activity in the afp of songbirds can direct moment - by - moment changes in the primary motor areas responsible for generating song . \n singing - related activity in lman is more variable in pattern across repeated renditions during undirected song than directed song [ 28 , 29 ] . \n reported that the fundamental frequency of the syllable was shifted by stimulating the lman - ra pathway , which is mediated by nmda receptors . \n our results indicated that the activity of nmda receptor changed the sensitivity of ra projection neuron . \n ra , as a premotor nucleus , occupies an important position in the song system , integrating information from both pathways . \n ra projection neurons are responsible for transmitting song information to midbrain and brainstem vocal and respiratory structures . temporal pattern of spike bursts in ra projection neurons is associated with the timing of acoustic features of birdsong . \n precise timing of individual spikes has a close relationship with stereotypic behavior , which suggests that the song is represented in ra by a temporal code [ 5 , 31 ] . \n thus , the modulation of nmda receptors in the activities of ra projection neurons could be very important for the plasticity of birdsong . \n previous studies in slices demonstrated that nmda receptor achieves the nonlinear , multiplicative behavior seen in gain modulation by several mechanisms . \n mel presented results from compartmental modeling studies showing that dendrites containing nmda - type synaptic conductances and voltage - dependent na , k , and ca channels can impose nonlinear interactions between nearby synapses that give rise to approximate multiplications [ 32 , 33 ] . in thalamocortical cell of the rat and cat dlgn , nmda receptors contribute to the burst firing generated by the low - threshold ca potential and depend on the membrane potential range over which this type of firing occurs . \n in substantia nigra dopamine neurons , nmda receptor - mediated synaptic conductance generates transient high - frequency activity by rapidly but transiently overwhelming the conductance 's underlying action potential ahp and/or engaging postsynaptic voltage - dependent ion channels in a manner that overcomes the limiting effects of ahp . \n but our results showed that there was no significant change in spike ahp after nmda application . \n so the gain induced by nmda in ra projection neurons may not be mainly modulated by the change of spike shape , but by synaptic activities . \n the change in membrane potential has been shown to play an important role in the firing pattern regulation by nmda receptor , supporting the idea that depolarization acutely alters firing frequency . \n it has been shown that simple excitability or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change in the cortical neurons . in this model , \n one set of synaptic inputs provided purely excitatory drive to a target neuron , and another set of combined excitatory / inhibitory inputs ( or balanced inputs ) provided the modulation . in this setup , changing the firing rates of the balanced inputs produced an approximately multiplicative gain modulation of the response to the purely excitatory drive . here \n , blockade of the excitatory or inhibitory transmission alone had no effect on the f - i slope of ra projection neuron , implying that simple excitability or inhibition alone can not induce a multiplicative gain change . \n however , our results did not exclude a role of spontaneous synaptic activity on gain modulation in vitro , which , due to the loss of synapses in slice , was not sufficient to produce a significant change in gain . \n ampa receptors are required for the gain modulation in our study , because blocking excitatory transmission mediated by ampa receptors almost abolished the effect of nmda on gain modulation . \n two reasons might be involved : one is the two states of nmda - base mechanism due to the special anatomical structure of ra . \n ra projection neurons receive inputs from two areas , hvc and lman . both are excitatory glutamatergic but have distinct postsynaptic properties . \n hvc - ra is largely mediated by ampa receptor , whereas lman - ra is almost completely mediated by nmda receptor . \n ampa / nmda receptor composition of different neuronal pathways is the foundation of gating and gain modulation . \n nmda receptor - rich pathway can gate ampa - rich input and increase the gain of a neuron responding to the input of ampa - rich pathway . \n the second is related to the intrinsic properties of nmda receptors , which are uniquely voltage dependent . except binding with neurotransmitter \n blockade of main excitatory inputs mediated by ampa receptor with cnqx hyperpolarized the membrane potential , which caused nmda receptors not activated . \n therefore , the ampa receptor - mediated excitatory transmission is essential for the gain modulation induced by nmda . \n it is well known that the nmda receptor plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes , such as learning , memory , neurodegeneration , epilepsy , and ischemia . \n the nmda receptor - mediated synaptic transmission satisfies the associative property of hebbian learning and in fact plays a critical role in its cellular model , long - term synaptic plasticity . \n nevertheless , pharmacological agents which block nmda receptors impair a variety of brain processes , suggesting that nmda receptor transmission also plays an important role beyond long - term memory and participates in shaping the dynamic activity of neural networks . in song system \n , the expression pattern of nmda receptor is related to the development of song learning [ 21 , 3740 ] . \n recent results show that the nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses generates variability across different song renditions , thereby facilitating reinforced learning of songs . how nmda accomplishes this role is not clear . \n our results showed that nmda application increased the gain of ra projection neurons , in which ampa receptor was necessary . \n the ampa receptor - mediated excitability is derived only from hvc [ 10 , 11 ] . \n therefore , nmda receptor in lman - ra synapse might regulate hvc - ra synaptic transmission , which implicated that nmda receptor is more effective to modulate the syllable online . \n these findings suggest a mechanism by which nmda receptor can selectively modulate behaviorally relevant excitatory inputs .",
         "the song of zebra finch is stable in life after it was learned successfully . \n vocal plasticity is thought to be a motor exploration that can support continuous learning and optimization of performance . \n the activity of ra , an important pre - motor nucleus in songbird 's brain , influences the song directly . \n this variability in adult birdsong is associated with the activity of nmda receptors in lman - ra synapses , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . \n the control of gain refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input and is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions . here , we observed the change of gain in ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to activate nmda receptors using the whole - cell current clamp recording . \n we found that nmda substantially increased the slope ( gain ) of the firing rate - current relationship in ra projection neurons . \n the ampa receptor - dependent excitability played a crucial role in the modulation of gain by nmda . \n these results suggested that nmda receptors may regulate the dynamics of ra projection neurons by input - output gain .",

         "suicide is a grave public health issue with a global mortality rate of 16 per 100,000 individuals.1 suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death , particularly among individuals aged 1544 years , which is a productive age group.1 suicide is a complex event that is influenced by biological , cultural , psychological , and socioeconomic factors . \n more than 90% of suicide victims were diagnosed with psychiatric problems at the time of death , and approximately two thirds had been diagnosed with depression.2,3 depressed patients tend to consult physicians other than psychiatrists , and a variety of medical professionals , including general practitioners , the staff of emergency departments , and non - psychiatric nurses , are key interveners for preventing suicide . among medical staff members , negative attitudes toward suicide such as \n anger could affect nontherapeutic reactions to suicidal individuals.4 furthermore , a belief that suicide is a personal right was negatively related to suicide intervention skills.5 an accurate assessment of the attitudes toward suicide held by medical staff members is relevant . \n previous studies have shown that difficulties with parental bonding during childhood could be a predisposing factor for the onset of many psychiatric conditions , such as anxiety , depressive states , and maladjusted behaviors.68 parental bonding and premorbid personality traits play an important role in shaping the developmental trajectory of an individual , including his / her ability to adjust to stressful events . \n although few studies have assessed the relationship between parental bonding and mental conditions among medical staff members,9,10 no study has evaluated the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide . \n the objective of this study was to investigate whether parental bonding is associated with attitudes toward suicide among medical college students in japan . \n students in their fifth year of medical school at hirosaki university , hirosaki , japan , participated in the study . \n the surveys were distributed to 226 medical students . of the distributed 226 surveys , 160 questionnaires ( 116 males and 44 females ) \n the demographic data ( age and sex ) were obtained from self - questionnaires and interviews . \n the data collection for this study was approved by the ethics committee of the hirosaki university school of medicine , and the subjects provided written informed consent before participating in the project . the parental bonding instrument ( pbi ) \n was administered to each participant to measure the attitudes and behavior of the parents.11 the pbi is a 25 item self - rating instrument by which individuals over the age of 16 report their experiences of being parented to the age of 16 . \n a total of 12 items measure the dimension of care , and 13 items measure protection , both on a likert scale . \n the care dimension of the pbi reflects parental warmth and involvement in contrast to rejection and indifference . \n the overprotection dimension of the pbi reflects parental overprotection and control in contrast to the encouragement of autonomy . \n higher scores on the care and protection dimensions reveal that participants perceive their parents to be more caring and/or protective . \n we employed the japanese version of the attitudes toward suicide questionnaire ( atts ) to assess the attitudes toward suicide held by the study participants.12 we employed a six factor model that was previously developed in studies of japanese attitudes , including \n common occurrence  ,  suicidal expression as mere threat  ,  unjustified behavior  , \n impulsiveness.12,13 each item , with the exception of items 10 and 28 , was scored on a five point scale from 1 ( strongly agree ) to 5 ( strongly disagree ) . \n items 10 and 28 were scored using a different scoring method that employed a five point scale from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) . \n multivariate regression analysis was applied to assess the relationship between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide . \n the data were analyzed using the pasw statistics software program for windows , version 18.0 . \n students in their fifth year of medical school at hirosaki university , hirosaki , japan , participated in the study . \n the surveys were distributed to 226 medical students . of the distributed 226 surveys , 160 questionnaires ( 116 males and 44 females ) \n the demographic data ( age and sex ) were obtained from self -

scales with the pbi scores . after adjusting for age and sex , \n maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the right to suicide . under the same conditions , maternal care \n the present study assessed attitudes toward suicide and their associations with parental bonding among japanese medical college students . \n the majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide ( 88.8% ) and that suicide is preventable ( 86.3% ) . \n in addition , the multiple regression analysis revealed that participants who reported a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide was a common occurrence and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide . \n domino and takahashi used the suicide opinion questionnaire to investigate the differences in attitudes toward suicide between students in japan and those in the united states , and the results demonstrated that the scores for  right to die  and  normality  were higher in japanese students and that those for  aggression  were higher in american students.14 etzersdorfer et al compared the attitudes towards suicide held by medical students in madras with those in vienna , finding that medical students in madras rejected the right to commit suicide and assisted suicide to a greater degree than the students in vienna.15 in a swedish study to assess whether attitudes differ between students at the beginning and end of their studies , students in the final year of medical school more frequently considered suicide to be an expression of psychiatric disease and thought that people attempting to commit suicide were not responsible for their actions.16 in addition , a study from japan revealed that sympathetic comments increased with the amount of years in school among students while critical comments decreased.17 in japan , mentality on suicide might be more culturally visible and acceptable than other countries . in past years , suicide was regarded as an honorable solution to personal guilt and failure . regarding occupational differences in attitudes toward suicide , \n onc et al found that medical students and general practitioners held the most permissive attitudes in turkey.18 in addition , they showed that the attitude scores of general practitioners regarding their preparedness to prevent suicide were lower compared to those of other groups . in japan , kodaka et al reported attitudes toward suicide among pharmacists using the atts.13 more than half of pharmacists reported that people understand the wishes of others to commit suicide , and 16.8% of the participants thought that people who mention suicide do not actually take their own lives . \n a 10 year follow - up study of norwegian physicians ( n=631 ) revealed that a low level of maternal care predicted severe depressive symptoms and partially mediated low self - esteem.9 lung et al assessed the psychological effects on 127 health care workers who had cared for suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) patients . \n early maternal attachment and neuroticism were found to heavily affect mental health during life - threatening stress.10 distinct patterns of parental bonding may contribute to the development of different dysfunctional schemas which may influence attitudes toward suicide.19 there are several limitations in this study . \n first , we used pbi to assess the child rearing behavior experienced by our participants . \n although pbi has shown basic reliability for long periods,20 we could not completely rule out possible influences of the current mood state or recall bias in individuals because pbi is an instrument for measuring recalled parental behaviors . \n second , certain parameters were not assessed in this study personality traits , a history of psychiatric disorders , suicidal behavior , and current mood state could affect the attitude towards suicidal behavior . third , because the participants in our study are medical students , we can not generalize these results to general practitioners . \n our study indicated that the majority of participants seriously believe that anyone could commit suicide . \n participants who have experienced a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide occurs commonly and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide . \n although parental bonding predisposes these attitudes toward suicide , educational programs could change caretaking practices.21 to achieve more positive attitudes towards suicidal behavior , promoting the best practices for suicide prevention is needed for medical students .",

treatment ( 100% ) among stage i. in stage ii overtreatment ( 91.1% ) was the main reason for guideline discordant therapies , followed by undertreatment ( 8.9% ) , and lack of treatment ( 3.8% ) . \n only 14.7% of the stage ii patients were treated appropriately . in severe and very severe patients , \n guideline concordant treatment rate was as high as 84.4% in stage iii and 83.2% in stage iv . in stage iii , 13.3% of patients were undertreated , and 2.3% of very severe copd patients did not receive any regular treatment . \n while undertreatment rate was 10.9% among stage iv patients , 5.9% of stage iv patients had no treatment for copd . \n the most administered treatment regimen was laba - ics - lama combination ( 43.4% , n=312 ) , followed by laba - ics - lama - t ( 22.5% , n=162 ) and laba - ics ( 10.9% , n=78 ) . in patients treated with regular bronchodilators , the most frequently used drug was laba ( n=613 ) , followed by lama ( n=575 ) , t ( n=197 ) , short - acting 2-agonist ( n=13 ) and short - acting muscarinic antagonistic drugs ( n=13 ) , respectively . the distribution of patients on bronchodilator alone , treatment containing ics , and no maintenance drug by copd stage is shown in table 3 . \n of all the patients , 614 ( 89% ) received treatment containing ics or ics alone . \n the distribution of patients who received ics was 43.8% in stage i , 81.5% in stage ii , 89.2% in stage iii , and 86.5% in stage iv . of the 25 ( 3.5% ) patients who were not on any medication , one patient was in stage i , nine in stage ii , eight in stage iii , and nine in stage iv . there were 327 ( 45.5% ) patients on short - acting bronchodilators used as rescue drugs in addition to maintenance therapy . \n of all the patients , 56 ( 7.8% ) were on monotherapy , 125 ( 17.4% ) on dual , 350 ( 48.7% ) on triple , and 163 ( 22.6% ) on quadruple therapy . \n long - term oxygen use rate was 22.4% ( n=112 patients ) in stages iii and iv patients . \n this is the first large - scale real - life study in turkey that reflects the clinical practice of pulmonary specialists through an observational analysis of their adherence to treatment recommendations of gold 2010 guideline . \n the survey was carried out in eleven pulmonary outpatient clinics spread over the national territory . \n our findings show that only 59.5% of overall patients were treated in accordance with the guideline recommendations . \n while inappropriate treatment regimens were more frequently prescribed for stages i ( 93.8% ) and ii ( 85.3% ) , overtreatment in early stages and high rate of ics administration ( 89% ) in all stages of disease resulted in improper therapeutic approach according to gold 2010 recommendations . in more severe disease stages , \n guideline - adherent therapeutic approaches were detected by wide use of ics addition to one or more long - acting bronchodilators . \n most of the provider s guideline adherence studies have reported the current practices of general practitioners . \n a few recent studies have reported similar rates of adherence to guideline recommendations for copd patients ( 37.9%54.7% ) between pulmonologists in other countries.4,5 stage i patients were overtreated with regular long - acting bronchodilators or combination of bronchodilators and icss , while guidelines recommend short - acting bronchodilators as initial therapy . in a study conducted among the pulmonary specialists in italy , corrado and rossi reported that 87.7% of the stage i patients received regular treatment containing long - acting bronchodilators , ics alone , or other treatment combinations of ics plus long - acting bronchodilators.4 in a retrospective database study in the united states , fitch et al reported that only 1% of the stage i patients received ics added to laba and lama , while 6% received ics plus single long - acting bronchodilators , and 76% did not receive any medication in stage i.11 shariff et al reported that 7.7% of the patients in stage i were overtreated and received inappropriate treatment according to the guidelines , in another study on guideline adherence among practitioners and pulmonary specialists.5 in our study , only 14.7% of the patients in stage ii received appropriate therapy , and this was mainly due to overtreatment which was combined long - acting bronchodilators and ics in 77.3% of the patients . \n other reasons for nonadherent therapeutic approaches were single use of ics in 3.4% of the patients and lack of treatment in 3.8% of the patients . other studies found 26%49.2% adherence to gold recommendations in this stage . \n overtreatment was 67.3% in one study,4 and lack of copd treatment has been reported in 54% of the patients in another report for stage ii.11 severe and very severe copd patients were treated by the combined use of one or more long - acting bronchodilators and ics which was compliant to gold recommendations . \n this finding can be explained by the features of this group of patients who are more symptomatic and have more frequent exacerbations . \n similar studies on guideline adherence in different countries also reported frequent use of dual and triple therapies in stages iii and iv.4,5,11 the ics was frequently used at all stages ( 43.8% in stage i , 81.5% in stage ii , 89.3% in stage iii , and 87.4% in stage iv ) mostly as a part of combination therapy . \n this study demonstrates that the pulmonary specialists in turkey have a high tendency to use ics for the treatment of patients with copd . in a study by de miguel - diez et al in spain , \n 34.5% of the patients were prescribed ics , alone or in combination , with a rate of inappropriate use of 18.2%.12 asche et al reported that 33% of the patients received combination treatment containing laba , lama , and/or ics consistent with the current gold guidelines.13 pulmonary specialists in our study mostly preferred to prescribe combination treatments containing ics . \n this might be related to a number of factors : \n inadequate time with patients , which leads to opting for combination therapies that can provide a broad - spectrum treatment.concerns about symptom control , exacerbation prevention alongside spirometric staging might influence the treatment choice of the specialist.reimbursement of all copd drugs in turkey , making them easily accessible for patients with health insurance.preferring to prescribe drug groups that are effective in the treatment of both asthma and copd , where a differential diagnosis is not available.increasing number of drugs that are provided in combinations and marketing strategies and publicity efforts that promote their use . \n inadequate time with patients , which leads to opting for combination therapies that can provide a broad - spectrum treatment . \n concerns about symptom control , exacerbation prevention alongside spirometric staging might influence the treatment choice of the specialist . \n reimbursement of all copd drugs in turkey , making them easily accessible for patients with health insurance . \n preferring to prescribe drug groups that are effective in the treatment of both asthma and copd , where a differential diagnosis is not available . increasing number of drugs that are provided in combinations and marketing strategies and publicity efforts that promote their use . in patients treated with regular bronchodilators ( alone or a part of a combination therapy ) , \n the most frequently used drug was laba ( n=613 ) , followed by lama ( n = 575 ) , t ( n=197 ) . among these results , \n t use was prescribed for 27.4% of stable copd patients which was remarkably higher than the finding of corrado and rossi that reported 2.2% of patients were using xanthines.4 gold remark on t is that it is effective in copd but , due to its potential toxicity , inhaled bronchodilators are preferred when available.1 in our study , this high rate of t prescription in addition to other inhaled bronchodilators may be explained by the choice of an oral bronchodilator drug even if it has potential toxicity and drug interactions in older patients . \n another finding of this study was that the use of long - acting bronchodilators such as laba and lama alone remains considerably low , and they have been mostly preferred in stages i , ii , and iii . \n the most commonly used bronchodilator in monotherapy was lama ( 4.2% ) , and this might be due to its single - dose use and duration of action of more than 24 hours.14,15 this study has several limitations . \n individual patient data were retrospectively collected through patient records : number of acute exacerbations in the previous year , complete information on comorbidities , adherence to nonpharmacologic interventions were lacking . \n gold guidelines were updated in 2011 to incorporate clinical presentation , including dyspnea as measured by copd assessment test and the modified british medical research council . \n the updated version of the guidelines incorporates clinical presentation with spirometry findings ( gold 2011).16 this study was undertaken between december 2010 and november 2011 . \n study protocol had been designed to evaluate gold 2010 guideline adherence . due to lack of knowledge on dyspnea level ( medical research council scale ) and exacerbation frequency during the last year \n even this new gold classification ( updated in 2011 ) has been changed by considering sypmtoms and exacerbations in addition to spirometric staging , we have not enough data as to the exact superiorities over the old gold classification . \n a very recent analysis showed that gold 2011 shifted the overall copd severity distribution to more severe categories . \n there were nearly three times more copd patients in stage d than in former stage iv ( p<0.05 ) . \n the predictive capacity for survival up to 10 years was significant for both systems ( p<0.01 ) and gold 2007 and 2011 did not differ significantly . in this study , \n the percent predicted fev1 thresholds of 85% , 55% , and 35% were found better to stage copd severity for mortality , which are similar to the ones used previously in the gold 2010 classification . increasing intensity of treatment of patients with copd according to their gold 2011 reclassification \n is not known to improve health outcomes.17 the classification recommended by the gold committee since 2011 does not seem to be adopted universally throughout europe . \n even if there is a real improvement over the previous classification due to taking into account clinical criteria , quality of life , and exacerbations , criticisms have arisen concerning the choice of certain pathways and therapeutic recommendations not based on prospective studies with a high level of evidence.18 at the national level , we do not have any published data on the adoption of the new gold 2011 classification . according to the previously mentioned obstacles of the new classification , and lack of the knowledge about the frequency of new gold 2011 classification use , instead of the gold 2010 . \n we believe this data on the guideline adherence among pulmonologists may still reflect the current attitude toward the routine approach of the diagnosis and therapies of copd in turkey , and also is concordant with the real life situation around the world . \n turkish thoracic society has published an updated report of copd prevention , diagnosis and treatment in 2014,19 and included in the global alliance against chronic respiratory disease ( gard ) with the ministry of health.20 the improvement of adherence to national and international copd guidelines may be achieved by continuing medical education supported by national thoracic societies . increased awareness of guidelines may influence the standardized care of copd patients , and will have prognostic influences . \n promotion of the compliance to evidence - based medicine by health authorities may have also positive effects on the attitude change in the real - life applications . \n this study showed that the pulmonary specialists in turkey have low rates of adherence to gold guidelines for treatment of stable copd patients . \n major improper approaches were overtreatment in early stages and excessive use of inhaler corticosteroids in all stages of disease . \n new strategies are needed to achieve a standardized approach for the treatment of copd , and thus to improve adherence to guideline recommendations , with particular focus on treatment indications and overtreatment in turkey .",

         "o - glycans have been found to play an important role in protein stability and tertiary structure , stabilize protein conformation , modulate the activity of enzymes ( e.g. by reversible attachment of o - linked glcnac to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins ) and signaling molecules , are essential for a number of recognition processes and are sorting determinants guiding the modified protein in the cell from the place of biosynthesis to its target location [ 13 ] . \n unlike the n - glycans they may be linked to several different amino acid residues ( very often serine or threonine , but also hydroxylysine , tyrosine or hydroxyproline ) of the protein and their occurrence can not be predicted easily by a common consensus sequence . \n extended galnac residues linked to serine or threonine residues ( mucin - type glycans ) are the most frequent and best investigated o - glycans in higher eukaryotes . \n eight core subtype formations showing cell - tissue specific patterns related to their function have been described ( for a review see ) . \n also glcnac--ser / thr without any elongation , a typical feature for nuclear and cytoskeletal proteins existing in a dynamic equilibrium with phosphorylation , and fuc--ser / thr as well as glc--ser , primarily found in epidermal growth factor domains , have been found in eukaryotes . \n a linkage via mannose has been found to be the main o - glycan type in yeasts , but also some mammalian tissues carry this structural feature , which seems to be relevant in some muscular dystrophies , while o - xylosylation is the starting point for the biosynthesis of chondroitin and heparan sulfates , which have roles in development and morphogenesis . \n the o - glycans of nematodes are rather complex with methylation as further modification [ 9 , 10 ] . \n xenopus eggs have o - glycans with up to 10 monosaccharide constituents , often highly fucosylated , with a linkage to the protein via galnac [ 11 , 12 ] . \n even parasites ( helminths and t. cruzi ) display small galnac linked o - glycans . in plants \n o - glycans occur as arabinogalactans linked to hydroxyproline or serine ( gal--hyp / ser ) , or hydroxyproline is glycosylated with short arabinofuranosides ( ara--hyp , ara--hyp ) . here \n we present for the first time an overview on o - glycans of some species of the mollusk branch of the evolutionary tree . \n the glycosylation potential of snails is important in general , because some of them are intermediate hosts of pathogens ( biomphalaria glabrata and lymnaea stagnalis ) or a pest in agriculture \n . a broad knowledge of their glycosylation abilities may show targets for pest control in the near future . \n in the course of the years , n - glycan patterns of several snail species have been presented [ 1417 ] . methylated mannose and galactose residues were found to be frequent constituents . in the present study we determine the main o - glycan structures in snails and characterize a common core - trisaccharide . \n cepaea hortensis , planorbarius corneus , arion lusitanicus , limax maximus and helix pomatia were collected by the authors under the supervision of dr . \n manfred pintar ( department of integrative biology and biodiversity research , institute of zoology , university of natural resources and life sciences , vienna ) in the vicinity of vienna . \n all chemicals purchased were of the highest quality available from sigma or fluka . while water living snails could be dissected right away , land living snails were extensively washed to remove the extraneous mucous components . \n snails were dissected as previously described   and proteins were purified according to   with minor modifications : 1  g of wet tissue was homogenised in 10  ml of chaps - based lysis buffer ( 0.5  % ( w / v ) chaps , 150  mm nacl , 20  mm tris / hcl , 2.5  mm sodium pyrophosphate , 1  mm ethylene - glycol - bis(2-aminoethylether)-n , n , n,n-tetraacetic acid and 1  mm edta , ph  7.5 ) and incubated for 72  h at 4  c . \n snail proteins were then reduced by the addition of 500  l of 10  mm dithiothreitol and incubation at 56  c for 45  min . \n then 500  l of 55  mm iodoacetamide were added and incubated for 30  min at room temperature in the dark . \n the aqueous samples were precipitated with a 4-fold amount of pre - chilled acetone at 20  c for at least 4  h and then centrifuged at 32000  g for 60  min . \n the pellets were resuspended in 0.1  m sodium citrate buffer , ph  4.6 , and incubated with 2 units of -glucosidase from rice [ ec 3.2.1.20 ] at 37  c for 16  h. sugars and polysaccharides were eluted from cation exchange chromatography ( ag 50  w - x2 , biorad , ca ) with 2  % of acetic acid , while proteins were eluted by 1.0  m ammonium acetate , ph  9.0 . \n the protein fraction was again precipitated by acetone followed by a similar precipitation by methanol . \n the dry sample was dissolved in 0.1  m naoh containing 0.8  m nabh3 and incubated at 37  c for 68  h. the sample was carefully neutralised by the addition of 2  m acetic acid , dried in a vacuum centrifuge and washed at least twice with 30  % ( v / v ) methanol . \n the glycans were directly extracted by solid phase extraction on a porous graphitized carbon cartridge ( supelclean envi - carb , 100  mg bed weight , 1  ml column volume or 500  mg bed weight , 6  ml column volume , sigma - aldrich , germany ) according to   by using ammonium formate buffer / acetonitrile for elution   and then on a reversed - phase c18 cartridge ( strata , c18-e , 55  m , 50  mg bed volume , 1  ml column volume , phenomenex , germany ) using 5  % ( v / v ) acetic acid as loading solvent and 25  % ( v / v ) isopropanol in 5  % ( v / v ) acetic acid for elution . \n hplc separation was carried out on a porous graphitized carbon ( pgc ) column ( hypersil - keystone , hypercarb 5   150    3  mm , thermo scientific , austria ) at a flow rate of 0.6  ml / min using 0.3  % ( v / v ) formic acid adjusted to ph  3.1 with ammonium as solvent a and 95  % ( v / v ) acetonitrile in solvent a as solvent b. the elution protocol consisted of 2  min at 100  % ( v / v ) of solvent a followed by a gradient of 28  min till 25  % ( v / v ) of solvent b and a cleaning step of 4  min at 60  % ( v / v ) of solvent b. each fraction was tested by esi - ms for its glycan content . \n single glycan structures were pooled and lyophilised . for monosaccharide analysis alditol acetates and for linkage analysis \n gc analysis was carried out on a vf 5  ms capillary column ( 60  m , 0.25  mm inner diameter ; 0.1  mm film thickness ; varian , darmstadt , germany ) and electron impact ( ei ) mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode using a polaris q instrument ( thermoquest - analytical systems ) . for analysis of small sample amounts with esi - ms an in - gel release method for glycans bound to coomassie \n reduced oligosaccharides were analyzed by pgc - lc - esi - ms on a hypercarb column ( 0.32    150  mm , thermo fisher scientific , austria ) coupled to an ultimate 3000 ( dionex ) capillary hplc and a q - tof ultima ms ( waters ) as described previously [ 21 , 26 ] . \n the interpretation of the ms data was performed with the help of the software tool glycoworkbench . \n arion lusitanicus proteins were isolated and separated from contaminants through several purification steps in order to obtain sufficient amounts ( 12  g ) of pure glycans for further gc - ms analysis ( total monosaccharide and linkage analysis ) . \n the preparation of o - glycans was carried out via -elimination followed by further separation steps . as a final procedure \n the glycans were separated on a pgc ( porous graphitized carbon ) hplc - column by collecting 1-minute fractions which were screened by esi - ms to gain clean single structures . in the course of the -elimination releasing the glycan from the protein backbone , sodium borohydride was used . \n in contrast , for reduction of monosaccharides before gc - ms analysis sodium borodeuteride was employed , which allowed further the discrimination between the sugar released by -elimination and those linked to other sugars previously . in fig \n .  1 monosaccharide constituents of the core trisaccharide representing the main structure found in a. lusitanicus , with a pseudomolecular mass ( [ m+h ] ) of m / z 576.3  da , were determined by gc - ms of the corresponding alditol acetates and identified on the basis of retention times in gc and their characteristic electron impact ( ei ) mass spectra . \n the results revealed the presence of a galnac - residue which was h - reduced , while all the other sugars were h reduced . \n therefore , galnac can be considered as the protein bound sugar . the high amount of 4-o - me - gal indicated that this residue is the one which is mainly involved in the elongation of the glycan . \n minor compounds were identified as contaminations by n - glycans ( glcnac and man ) or storage glycans ( glc and gal ) . \n the lc - esi - ms / ms fragmentation pattern confirmed the occurrence of two methylated hexoses linked to the amino sugar ( fig . \n 1monosaccharide constituent analysis of the core trisaccharide of a. lusitanicus released by [ h ] reductive -elimination . \n alditol acetates obtained after acid hydrolysis , reduction with sodium borodeuteride and peracetylation or hydrolysis and peracetylation of already existing alditols were identified by gc -

glycan core structure identified 2,3,4,6-tetra - o - methyl - galacitol at 20.66  min and 1,4,5-tri - o - methyl galnac - ol at 33.33  min ( fig \n .  3a ) which could be verified by ei - ms data ( figs . \n 3b and c ) . to determine the position of the naturally occurring methyl group on the galactose \n this allows in the ei -

ms consisted of the core trisaccharide elongated by an unmethylated hexose on one arm and a methylated hexose on the other one ( fig . \n the presence of significant amounts of man and 3-o - me - man indicated that these two residues were responsible for the elongation . \n gc - ms analysis using different derivatisation protocols requested a high amount of material and high quality of purification . especially for snail tissues this was a challenge and \n therefore this method could not be carried out for a large number of samples in due time . \n an in - gel -elimination after sds - page followed by a short clean - up ( pgc - cartridge ) procedure was sufficient . \n the shortened protocol also ensured that no weakly bound modifications , such as sulfate or sialic acids for example , got lost . combining our data on snail monosaccharide analysis , data from previous gc - ms methylation analysis   and the fragmentation results of lc - esi - ms / ms analysis of selected snails we could determine the main structures of snail o - glycans and classify them according to their modification of the established core structure into six groups : ( i ) glycans smaller than the core , missing one or both methyl groups or missing one hexose ; ( ii ) the trisaccharide core containing galnac and two 4-o - methylated hexose residues ; ( iii ) the core with additional methylated hexoses ; ( iv ) the core with one or two additional unmethylated hexoses and sometimes one more methylated hexose ; ( v ) glycans containing fucose ; ( vi ) glycans containing one hexnac and up to six unmethylated hexoses . \n for an overview on the structures see table  1.table 1overview of o -

glycan distribution in selected snail species given in [ % ] of total o - glycans . \n compositions are given in terms of hexose ( hex ) , methylated hexose ( mehex ) , n - acetylhexosamine ( hexnac ) and deoxyhexose ( fucose ; dhex ) analyzing snails in detail , it was obvious that the o - glycan trisaccharide core is an important decoration of snail proteins in all investigated species . in five of the analyzed snails ( a. lusitanicus , a. fulica , h. pomatia , l. maximus , c. helena ) this glycan was the most abundant type of o - glycan . \n b. glabrata and c. hortensis displayed as their main glycan the trisaccharide elongated by one or two unmethylated hexoses , respectively . \n only p. corneus was an exception possessing a large amount of hex4hexnac glycan . whereas the addition of one hexose to the core was relatively frequent , larger structures were minor compounds or were even not present in several species . \n the only detected amino sugar was galnac which provided in all cases the connection to the protein . \n gal and man were present in unmethylated or mono - methylated ( 3-o - me - gal , 4-o - me - gal , 3-o - me - man ) versions . \n fucose , which had been identified as such in previous works [ 23 , 28 ] , occurred only in low amounts and was detected linked to galnac as well as to terminal sugar residues by ms / ms fragmentation . \n during the last decades our knowledge on glycosylation processes - structure of the glycans and the corresponding biochemical pathways including the responsible enzymes - increased enormously , especially for glycans of mammalian origin . \n the glycosylation capabilities of other species were only under investigation if their glycans were for any reason connected with human life ( e.g. some recognition processes of pathogens or allergy on food or plant glycans ) or if they were potent candidates for cell culture systems for the expression of therapeutics ( some insect , yeast and plant cells ) . \n in the meantime more and more invertebrate systems are investigated because of their potential usefulness for biotechnological reasons or to get some deeper insights into the processing pathways of unusual glycan structures . \n previous studies on various invertebrates showed that glycosylation has a lot more varieties than we expected as long as only mammals were investigated , but the data are scattered . \n still the main focus is laid on n - glycans but the interest in o - glycans is growing . \n a number of difficulties arose during snail glycan analysis due to the tough tissue , which was not easy to homogenize and the rigid mucus , which had to be discarded diligently . \n the removal of storage carbohydrates , which might influence monosaccharide analysis and the separation of n- and o - glycans were other struggles to resolve . while the first was done by -glucosidase digestion from rice , the latter was an even more difficult task . \n n - glycosidases ( pngase a and f ) did not remove the n - glycans completely and even mild -elimination conditions seemed to be able to release , at least in part , residual n - glycans which resulted in n - glycan impurities in o - glycan fractions . \n furthermore some n - glycans of snails and digested storage glycans are so small ( 45 sugar residues [ 16 , 17 ] ) that they may co - migrate on hplc with o - glycans \n . therefore only a limited number of glycans could be prepared in terms of sufficient amount and purity for permethylation followed by maldi - tof - ms and gc - ms linkage analysis . \n however , in combination with lc - esi - ms of native glycans which is capable of a high throughput of samples the o - glycan pattern of 8 snail species ( land snails with shell : achatina fulica , cepaea hortensis and helix pomatia ; slugs : arion lusitanicus and limax maximus ; water snails : biomphalaria glabrata , clea helena , and planorbarius corneus ) could be identified . \n four monosaccharide constituents  galnac , gal , man and fuc  are the building blocks of the structures . \n the only further modification is a methylation of the hexoses , resulting in 3-o - me - gal , 4-o - me - gal and 3-o - me - man , which has already been shown for snail n - glycans [ 1417 , 23 ] . \n each o - glycan contains only one amino sugar , which is the protein linked galnac . \n the linkage amino acid was not determined in detail , but due to the easy release by -elimination the common galnac - ser / thr motif is very likely . \n the connection to other amino acids , for example tyrosine , is usually more stable . in snail o - glycans the inner galnac \n is frequently elongated by two 4-o - me - gal residues in ( 13)- and ( 16)-linkage . elongations of this trisaccharide core by one or two hexoses with or without methyl group appeared in most snail species , whereas further elongation or fucosylation are rare events . \n insects , one neighbor of mollusks in the phylogenetic tree , display also internal galnac elongated by one gal in their o - glycan structures , but further elongations and/or branching are frequently done by another amino sugar ( galnac or glcnac ) . \n the main o - glycans of toxocara canis are trisaccharides consisting of galnac , gal or 4-o - gal and 2-o - fuc . \n so far nothing is known about biological functions of snail glycans . for sure these glycans \n are similarly involved in recognition processes as they are in all other species , but especially the significance of the high degree of methylation of hexoses of n- as well as of o - glycans is waiting for elucidation . here \n we enlarge the current knowledge on glycosylation abilities of lower animals by presenting the first o - glycan analysis of snails , representatives of the mollusk phylum .",
         "the glycosylation abilities of snails deserve attention , because snail species serve as intermediate hosts in the developmental cycles of some human and cattle parasites . in analogy to many other host - pathogen relations , the glycosylation of snail proteins may likewise contribute to these host - parasite interactions . here \n we present an overview on the o - glycan structures of 8 different snails ( land and water snails , with or without shell ) : arion lusitanicus , achatina fulica , biomphalaria glabrata , cepaea hortensis , clea helena , helix pomatia , limax maximus and planorbarius corneus . \n the o - glycans were released from the purified snail proteins by -elimination . \n further analysis was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and  for the main structures  by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry . \n snail o - glycans are built from the four monosaccharide constituents : n - acetylgalactosamine , galactose , mannose and fucose . \n an additional modification is a methylation of the hexoses . \n the common trisaccharide core structure was determined in arion lusitanicus to be n - acetylgalactosamine linked to the protein elongated by two 4-o - methylated galactose residues . \n further elongations by methylated and unmethylated galactose and mannose residues and/or fucose are present . \n the typical snail o - glycan structures are different to those so far described . \n similar to snail n - glycan structures they display methylated hexose residues .",

         "neurofibromatosis ( nf ) is an autosomal dominant disease , discovered in 1882 , by the german pathologist friedrich daniel von recklinghausen , characterized by disordered growth of ectodermal tissues , and is part of a group of disorders called phakomatoses ( neurocutaneous syndrome ) . \n neurofibromatosis type - i ( nf-1 ) , also known as von recklinghausen syndrome , is caused by the mutation of a gene on the long arm of chromosome 17 , which encodes a protein known as neurofibromin . \n it is characterized by spots of increased skin pigmentation ( caf au lait spots ) , combined with peripheral nerve tumors and a variety of other dysplastic abnormalities of the skin , nervous system , bones , endocrine organs , and blood vessels . \n the localized form of neurofibromatosis type - i , first described by gammel in 1931 , is very rare . \n crowe et al . proposed the term sectorial neurofibromatosis for this localized form of neurofibromatosis , and miller and sparkes modified the nomenclature to segmental neurofibromatosis ( sn )  the current term for neurofibromas of segmental distribution . \n the commonly affected sites for sn are the thorax and abdomen ( 55% ) , upper extremities ( 20% ) , and lower limb and face ( 10% each ) . only few cases ( less than 10 ) of segmental neurofibromatosis over the face have been described so far . \n a 26-year - old female patient reported to the dental department complaining about the unesthetic appearance of her face , since eight years [ figure 1 ] . \n history revealed that eight years back , the patient underwent surgery in the neck region for a cyst and one to two days after surgery the patient got a swelling on the face . \n the swelling was of the same size since then and there was no pain associated with the swelling . \n the unesthetic appearance of the face on examination , the face of the patient appeared asymmetrical , bilaterally , with a growth on the right side of the face . \n the skin over the right side of her face was thickened and hyperpigmented , with a soft and loose hanging overgrowth . \n there were numerous small and large , sessile and pedunculated nodular growths localized on the right side of her neck , with dark - colored underlying skin . \n the skin over the right cheek and chin area showed coffee - colored pigmentation ( caf - au - lait spots ) [ figure 2 ] . \n nodular growths localized on the right side of the neck with dark colored underlying skin there was a soft , compressible , nontender growth on the lower lip . \n the right ear showed disfigurement and hypertrophy , with thickened cartilage and overlying hyperpigmented skin [ figure 3 ] . \n disfigurement of the ear and hypertrophy with thickened cartilage and overlying hyperpigmented skin intraorally there were numerous soft tissue growths with a sessile base seen on the right buccal mucosa [ figure 4 ] and tongue [ figure 5 ] . \n soft tissue growths with sessile bases on right buccal mucosa soft tissue growths with sessile bases on the tongue laboratory findings revealed a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) ( 70 mm in the first hour ) , a decreased hemoglobin level ( 7.5 gm% ) , and the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) was found to be nonreactive . a panoramic radiograph disclosed asymmetric enlargement of the right side of the mandible , with loss of cortication of the lower border in the midline area , expansion of the body of the mandible causing displacement of the teeth , seen on right side , expansion of the right inferior alveolar nerve canal , enlarged mental foramen , resorption of the roots of the mandibular right teeth , and loss of the right antegonial notch . \n a deficiency was seen on the right side of the maxilla , with crowding of the posterior teeth [ figure 6 ] . \n a panoramic radiograph the right lateral oblique radiograph revealed a deep sigmoid notch , loss of the antegonial notch , an enlarged and rounded coronoid process , with resorption of the mandibular right teeth [ figure 7 ] . \n a right lateral oblique radiograph subsequently , biopsy of one of the nodules was taken and sent for histopathological examination . \n the histopathological slide revealed a non - encapsulated tumor of the dermis with a normal overlying epidermis . \n the tumor consisted of loosely spaced spindle cells and wavy collagenous strands in a clear matrix [ figure 8 ] . a non - encapsulated tumor of the dermis , with a normal overlying epidermis \n these tumors are composed of schwann cells , fibroblasts , mast cells , and vascular components . \n the caf au lait spots are irregularly - shaped , evenly pigmented , brown macules . \n most individuals with neurofibromatosis have six or more spots that are 1.5 cm or greater in diameter . in young children , \n five or more caf au lait macules , greater than 0.5 cm in diameter , are suggestive of neurofibromatosis . \n less than 1% of the healthy children have three or more such spots , although one or two caf au lait macules are commonly encountered in healthy individuals without disease . \n bone involvement includes pseudoarthrosis of the tibia , bowing of the long bones , and orbital defects . \n treatment of neurofibromatosis is predominantly surgical . when neurofibromas increase in size or cause pain , malignant transformation must be suspected , and excision or biopsy must be performed . \n acoustic neuromas and tumors that cause tinnitus and vertigo must be excised with great caution . \n plastic surgeons may be included in the correction of deformities , especially those of the face . considering the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of neurofibromatosis , genetic counseling",
         "segmental neurofibromatosis is a rare disorder , characterized by neurofibromas or caf-au - lait macules limited to one region of the body . \n its occurrence on the face is extremely rare and only few cases of segmental neurofibromatosis over the face have been described so far . \n we present a case of segmental neurofibromatosis involving the buccal mucosa , tongue , cheek , ear , and neck on the right side of the face .",
