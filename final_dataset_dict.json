Here\u2019s our roundup.\n\n\u201cHoneymoon\u201d \u2605\u00bd Another day, another doomed relationship, another Lana Del Rey song. The noir-pop singer is teasing her upcoming album, \u201cHoneymoon,\u201d with the title track, a meandering, string-heavy ballad that finds Del Rey helplessly in love with a boy who has a \u201cviolent past.\u201d There is a dark beauty at play, but singing about torrid affairs is a formula that\u2019s starting to wear very thin.\n\n\u201cNew Person, Same Old Mistakes\u201d \u2605\u2605\u2605 For their third album, \u201cCurrents,\u201d Tame Impala has moved beyond psych-rock fetishes and eased into their own hybrid of slow-motion funk and blue-eyed soul. It makes for a heady brew, especially on this closer, where frontman Kevin Parker sounds blissfully intoxicated by the rush of a blossoming relationship. \u201cI know that you think it\u2019s fake/Maybe fake\u2019s what I like,\u201d he croons at the naysayers, and it\u2019s hard not to be swept up in his abandon.\n\n\u201cNo Sympathy from the Devil\u201d \u2605\u2605\u2605 Hip-hop has a new generation of talent taking on modern political and racial upheaval, but having Public Enemy back only adds to the fury. On the opening track from their new album \u201cMan Plans, God Laughs,\u201d they bring brutal, \u201cYeezus\u201d-esque production to the fore, while Chuck D takes aim at today\u2019s political and social hubris with a heightened lyrical power.\n\n\u201cEML Ritual\u201d \u2605\u2605\u00bd The British dance duo don\u2019t sound quite like the revelation they were in the 1990s, but new album \u201cBorn in the Echoes\u201d still exhibits far more depth than much of the modern EDM they spawned. An intense, techno throb powers through this standout, which, thanks to the warped guest vocals of Ali Love, sounds like someone slowly losing his grip on reality. Unsettling and exciting all at once.\n\n\u201cLast 4th of July\u201d \u2605\u2605\u2605 Don\u2019t bother pulling out those old Beach Boys songs this summer \u2014 opt for White Reaper instead. On this cut (taken from their superb debut album, \u201cWhite Reaper Does it Again\u201d), the scrappy, Kentucky-based rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers take melodies that Brian Wilson would have adored back in the day, and feed them through a grinder of youthful aggression and sexual frustration.

Participants were asked to design a superyacht based on the hull of a commercially available 60m SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) hull.\n\nFor Desautel, an Oregon-born student at the California College of the Arts, School of Architecture, the contest provided an opportunity to dramatically redefine the aesthetics of these luxury vessels. The versatility of Lego bricks (they \u201ccan be connected a thousand different ways\u201d, he says) has influenced much of his work and each floor of Glass is stacked upon the other like a building block.\n\nAt its core, the 5,600sq ft yacht features an elevator shaft, alongside living and working space for staff. The interior is otherwise largely open-plan and, in keeping with the brief, includes six guest bedrooms, a private owner\u2019s lounge, a family lounge and children\u2019s playroom. The steps at the aft deck, meanwhile, are meant to resemble those found at ancient Mayan temples and provide additional outdoor space.\n\nA shortlisted entry in this year\u2019s awards, Desautel\u2019s design has been commended by the Boat International Young Design of the Year judges for being particularly family-friendly, but for now Glass remains a concept. Its rigid looks stand in marked contrast to other recently unveiled superyacht prototypes, such as the sinuous yacht designed by Zaha Hadid for Hamburg-based shipbuilders Blohm + Voss. One of the most distinctive superyachts currently on the water is the 390ft (119m) A, designed by Philippe Starck. It features an unusual upside down hull and a hooked, beak-like bow. Also built by Blohm + Voss, it is one of the world\u2019s largest superyachts.",

You can drink soda on a beach or drink soda in a park. That\u2019s about it. However, it\u2019s become a cult hit on PCs, with a version set to be released on the Xbox One in the next few months.\n\nIt\u2019s also simple enough that it\u2019s now being used by Myomo, a Cambridge startup that is helping people with partly paralyzed or weakened arms to regain movement in their limbs.\n\nIt all started when Will Brierly and Sean Halloran met over soda at the Cambridge Innovation Center.\n\nBrierly, the developer behind \u201cSoda Drinker Pro,\u201d had begun selling \u201cbonus sodas,\u201d actual drinks that went along with the game, and Halloran wanted to buy a case. They e-mailed each other and found out they worked in the same building. After a short discussion, they realized their interests overlapped, and that the game could have other uses besides for entertainment.\n\nHalloran is a 21-year-old Worcester Polytechnic Institute student whose research has focused on how games can motivate and train people to establish better health habits. Lately, he\u2019s been making games for the MyoPro, a battery-powered brace that helps train patients who have lost movement in their arms. He had already helped design \u201cBounce,\u201d which is similar to \u201cPong\u201d and has players move a paddle. Another, \u201cMyoSpace,\u201d is an asteroid-shooting game. \u201cSoda Drinker Pro,\u201d which only entails moving around the in-game environment and drinking soda, was a perfect fit for the brace.\n\nAll the two had to do was tweak the game for use with the brace \u2014 changing the controls so it worked with muscle movements instead of a controller, for example. Within a couple of months, it was ready for testing.\n\nPatients can now practice lifting up the soda in the game. Moving the arm up and down will lift the soda, and tensing the bicep will allow the player to take a sip.\n\nWhat made \u201cSoda Drinker Pro\u201d a great candidate for the MyoPro was this noncompetitive gameplay. The goal is to explore environments and drink virtual soda. When players are ready, they can move on to the next stage. Patients could focus on practicing with the hardware, getting to know how to move their arms, and have fun in what even Brierly calls a \u201csilly game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe movement in it is basically picking up a glass and putting it back down,\u201d Brierly said. But those small motions can be instrumental in recovery, he said.\n\nWhile video games are often associated with unhealthy lifestyles, increasingly, researchers have been finding ways to use them for more practical purposes.\n\n\u201cGames for health and training people that are like \u2018Soda Drinker Pro\u2019 are about positive reinforcement,\u201d Halloran said.\n\nHe said he often sees people who get frustrated navigating around the natural environment relax and lose themselves a bit while they\u2019re playing the game.",

Not anymore. Now the style is called the disconnected undercut, and these days it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nNick Wooster, the men\u2019s fashion industry veteran, has a disconnected undercut. So does Nathan McCallum, the men\u2019s style blogger.\n\nThe Justins Timberlake and Bieber, along with Brad Pitt, are credited with popularizing the look, though it isn\u2019t limited to men. The most influential disconnected undercut right now might belong to Ruby Rose, the actress who stars on \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d\n\nDespite its technical-sounding name, the cut is basic. The sides are shaved with clippers set to one or zero. The top is left long. And unlike a classic blend or fade, the transition from short to long hair is abrupt \u2014 that is, disconnected.\n\nJordan O\u2019Brien, a San Francisco-based YouTube style vlogger who has the haircut, said it\u2019s a can\u2019t-miss look. \u201cThe reason people have it is it\u2019s so versatile,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cAnd it looks good on anybody.\u201d\n\nIndeed, with the tuft on top you can do just about anything, from slicked back with gel; to a messy, beachy approach; to a classic side part that feels 1940s-era G.I., like Mr. Pitt\u2019s look in the film \u201cFury.\u201d\n\nThe major league pitcher A. J. Burnett wears a kind of bushy disconnected mohawk. The musician Sam Hunt shaved lines into his short sides. Some guys grow the top long and use styling product to swoop their hair into a disconnected pompadour, as did David Beckham in a recent H&M campaign. This was a new take on the disconnected undercut he has worn for years, arguably starting the trend.\n\nThe look\u2019s godfather may be the director David Lynch, who has been short on the sides and longer on top for years.\n\nJustin Lefkovitch, the chief executive of Mirrored Media, a music marketing firm based in Santa Monica, Calif., said that he went in a completely different direction, with a disconnected undercut that is \u201cpart of that man-bun family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hair is a little unruly, so I prefer not to do the greasy slicked-back look,\u201d Mr. Lefkovitch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a super relaxed, bunned up into a ball in the back. I call it the disconnected topknot.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Lefkovitch said the look isn\u2019t so wild that it turns heads in business meetings. His hairstylist, Jamie Pierce, agreed.\n\nMs. Pierce, who works at the Doves presented by Studio DNA salon in Santa Monica, said that she has been asked to do so many disconnected undercuts in the last year that she has become an expert at it. The style allows conservative older guys to be a little fashion-forward, she said, describing it as \u201cbarbering with a twist.\u201d\n\nStill, maintaining the haircut isn\u2019t as simple as the ear buzzing you received at the barbershop as a kid. Kyle Schaffler, a fashion publicist in New York, said he had to learn how to use a round-head bristle brush in conjunction with a blow dryer to shape the top tuft so it wouldn\u2019t flop around.\n\n\u201cYou have to do something with it to give it some style,\u201d Mr. Schaffler said, adding that during the workweek he blow-dries it back for a professional look.\n\nAsked if he thought the disconnected undercut was as universal as touted, Mr. Schaffler said it depended on the guy.\n\n\u201cNick Wooster rocking this haircut, that\u2019s so cool,\u201d he said. \u201cIf my dad was rocking this hairstyle, I\u2019d say: \u2018What are you doing? We\u2019re going to the barber right now.\u2019 \u201d",

The question, and the personal letter that posed it 36 years ago, fairly leapt out of a file of old Government memos and data at the National Archives. By poignant coincidence, the letter, misfiled until now, was from a Polish national complaining of Soviet abuse, a letter written as a cry from the heart in behalf of a brother, a Polish officer reported murdered in World War II in the Katyn Forest massacre.

The Georgetown Citizens Association, whose members have winced for years as the handsome old cobbled neighborhood yielded to all manner of boutiquery and fast-food eatery, sued this week and charged that the area's historic Market House by law should be used for the sale of fresh fish, meat, produce and other traditional marketplace items. These first gave the M Street landmark its identity back in 1795, well before fast-food seemed America's manifest destiny. The citizens' group complains that when the building was restored two years ago, a Congressional mandate to maintain its marketplace tradition was ignored when pizza mongers and other foodstand entrepreneurs were tolerated.\n\nJ AMES G. WATT got some good public relations mileage early this year when, in taking over the Department of the Interior, he decided to forgo the large office that most Secretaries use and to spend only a small part of his furnishings budget. But there is a price for all gestures in Washington, according to Administration workers who report that Mr. Watt's decision required the surrender of an underling's office and set off a time-@ and work-consuming game of musical chairs that trickled down the pecking order. Mr. Watt took a smaller office of an under secretary nearby on the department's executive sixth floor, and the under secretary then displaced a solicitor who unbegat an assistant secretary for Indian affairs, who moved up to the seventh floor and bumped an underling down to the fourth-floor office of a policy analyst, who nudged out the water research office, which, thankfully for the bureaucracy, broke the chain of demand and found extra room on the seventh floor. By unofficial estimate, the moves consumed parts of three days for some workers, plus breaks for coffee and sardonic observations.\n\nS MALL, quiet art shows are routine in the many monumental lobbies of Washington. But the one under way now at the Shoreham Hotel for the paintings of Otari Shiuk, a Russian emigre once noted in his homeland for his film and stage designs, is an occasion of intense pride for the fast-thriving colony of Soviet Jews in the suburb of Rockville, Md. This community includes some of the best-educated professionals to leave the Soviet Union in the recent wave of Jewish emigration, writers and scientists who landed university and government jobs here. For some of them, like Alla Berkovich, the act of setting down new roots two years ago has meant unexpected adventures of self-identity.\n\n''I would like to be a Jew,'' Mrs. Berkovich, a chemist who teaches at Georgetown University, says gently, noting that her two children now know more Hebrew and more Judaism than she can recall from her secular world of Moscow. ''It is a beautiful time now she says of the Judeo-Christian-rholiday customs in America, ''But people who come from Russia can forget who they are. It is a most difficult thing to be free and to have the habit of a lot of choices.''\n\nShe and her husband, Semyon, a computer science professor at George Washington University, have made the clear choice of seeing that their children are taught Jewish traditions, and the children enjoy the edge in expertise they are gaining.

She was a demon. We had to destroy her.\"\n\nThe group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult.\n\nMs Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate.\n\nThe public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse.\n\nThe only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie.\n\nNo-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.\n\nSince the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",

Rather than merely a compilation of recipes, the book will be more \"novelesque,\" complete with anecdotes.\n\nHe also plans to include some recipes from his Puerto Rican-Navaho Indian heritage.\n\nA true food lover, Soto finds it difficult to decide on a favorite dish.\n\n\"I eat everything,\" he responds. \"It's like when somebody asks me what my favorite ballet is, I can't answer that either.\"\n\nCook onion, pepper and garlic in butter until tender, about 10 minutes.

The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on.\n\n'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.'\n\nThe slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week.\n\nShe added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being.\n\n'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now.\n\n'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone.\n\n'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages.\n\n'Now I can spend more time with the kids.'\n\nLizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'.\n\nShe added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes.\n\n'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done.

His concern for the news and how it was covered made all of us who worked with him better at what we did.\"\n\nHe enjoyed discovering and hiring talented youngsters, many straight from their college newspapers. He was generous with praise and gentle with criticism. He always allowed a reporter to make changes in a story himself -- after patiently explaining why the change needed to be made.\n\n\"The most fun he had was cultivating young reporters,\" said his friend, Chronicle copy editor Bill Pates. \"He also really enjoyed his days as assistant city editor, where he was able to work on copy and deal with the Sacramento bureau.\"\n\nA native of Baltimore and a graduate of Loyola College in Baltimore, Mr. Gavin was a sports reporter and columnist at the Baltimore News American before coming to The Chronicle in 1969.\n\nFor many years he served as night city editor, directing the coverage of late-breaking stories and long features. In between, he managed to find time to attend countless theater productions and San Francisco Giants games. He admired a well-turned double play, a well-sung showstopper and a well-mixed Manhattan.\n\nHis tenure at The Chronicle was not without controversy. Before leaving the paper in 1977, he was criticized for his decisions related to the coverage of Peoples Temple leader Jim Jones. The Jonestown tragedy happened the following year.\n\nMr. Gavin returned briefly to the now-defunct Baltimore News American before joining the staff of the (Cherry Hill, N.J.) Courier-Post, where he was known as \"Big Steve.\" He served as city editor, columnist and editorial writer for nearly 25 years before retiring in 2003.\n\n\"He was so passionate about good writing,\" said Courier-Post columnist Kevin Riordan, whom Mr. Gavin hired as a cub reporter in 1980. \"Sports writing, editorials, nonfiction, fiction -- if it was good, he was passionate about it. He certainly helped me tremendously. I do a lot of things automatically that I learned from him, and I owe him a lot.\"\n\nOn his desk, said Riordan, he keeps a three-word note of writing advice (\"watch your 'whiches' \") that Mr. Gavin wrote to him a quarter century ago.\n\nIn his spare time, Mr. Gavin hopped the train to New York to attend countless Broadway plays and musicals. He was a regular at Baltimore Orioles games, although he often attended them wearing his old San Francisco Giants cap. He read any newspaper he could get his hands on.\n\nHe is survived by his longtime partner, Ichan Ando of Burlington, N.J., by sisters Patricia Gavin of Bel Air, Md., and Valerie Vogt of Lancaster, Pa., and by brother Gerald Gavin, of Baltimore.\n\nAt Mr. Gavin's request, no service will be held.",

While I sleep my computer translates the music into a compressed digital format onto my computer's hard drive. Over the course of the past year I have been steadily building my own personal jukebox from the 300 CD's I own. I can now listen to only my favorite songs on an album, rearrange songs into my preferred order, or move them to a portable player. Besides my own virtual personal radio station, I also have an index and catalog of the music I have bought.\n\nI am not the only one digitizing music. Without breaking any law, I could just as easily have gone on the Web to download the songs I had bought in the same digital format, thanks to the prior work of many other music lovers. So far music listeners around the world have digitized more than 850,000 albums and 10 million songs of all musical genres. Fans have already converted almost all music ever recorded.\n\nThis point is essential to the case that was heard Wednesday in the Supreme Court. In Eldred v. Ashcroft, copyright holders argued that it is vital to extend the life of copyright -- even though it has already been extended 11 times in the last four decades. A 1998 law extended the protection of copyright for an additional 20 years: material is now protected for 70 years after the creator's death or for 95 years if the copyright is held by a corporation. Only after the copyright has lapsed does it enter the public domain, meaning that anyone can use the work for whatever purpose -- creative, academic, even commercial.\n\nOwners of an about-to-expire copyright have several favorite arguments for extending it. One is that it spurs creativity by making original works more valuable. But an extension actually restricts creativity by narrowing the shared universe of works artists can build upon. Another is that they need an extension as an incentive to convert old material into new media. As Jack Valenti, the chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, has pointed out, digitizing films is expensive. ''Who is going to digitize these public domain movies?'' he asks.\n\nI have an answer: movie buffs. Not only have fans moved almost all of music into the digital era, they have been busy moving hundreds of millions of documents onto the Web and are producing millions of pages of daily reporting and news in Weblogs. And without the help of paralyzed publishers, avid readers have already converted nearly 20,000 books in the public domain.\n\nThe passion of fans is unstoppable -- and technology will make it only more so. Listeners, readers and watchers now have the means to do chores that companies themselves used to have to do. Yet instead of seeing this new force as a positive development, corporate copyright holders view it as something that must be quashed. While reformatting an old film is more trouble than slipping a CD into a personal computer, as bandwidth and storage continue to drop in price, more movie fans will have the means to convert old films. Given the benefits of digitized films, there is little question that film buffs, powered only by passion, would rush to convert the 500 to 1,000 films that fall out of copyright each year -- if the copyright period is not extended.\n\nAll that is keeping fans from this work is the steady erosion of the public domain by corporate copyright holders. Copyright extension serves only to keep everyone -- fans and corporations -- away from old masterpieces. If the Supreme Court upholds the current law, some old works of uncertain ownership, which would normally be allowed to come into the public domain, will now be locked up for another couple of decades. For some films on old stock, this could be their death.\n\nUnder the current copyright regime, short-term profit outweighs long-term value. As copyright protection lurches toward perpetuity, America's cultural heritage -- in whatever media -- is increasingly becoming the property of corporate copyright holders. But it belongs to all of us. Technology has given fans the means to enhance and protect this common heritage. The law should give them the right.",

Given the highly technical nature of the challenges facing the United States in the Gulf, one would assume that Lazarus comes from a background deep in technical know-how, operational understanding of offshore processes and an unbiased perspective on the critical issue of this nation\u2019s energy development.\n\nUnfortunately for the future of American energy production and consumption, Lazarus\u2019 background is far from technical and, perhaps more ominously, far from unbiased. Lazarus is an environmental lawyer who has, in fact, argued 30 cases in front of the Supreme Court on behalf of environmental interests. Quite simply, Lazarus is an incredibly accomplished, incredibly talented opponent of offshore drilling.\n\nThe problems with the president\u2019s new commission do not stop with its new head. As noted by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board, it\u2019s devoid of a single expert on oil production or offshore development. The lone member with a background in any type of engineering specializes in physics and optics, far from an oil and gas expert. The group is, however, well-stocked with anti-drilling activists and high-ranking officers of environmental groups.\n\nThe BP spill may prove to be as hard to interpret as an airline accident where the black box is missing. It is likely that a large combination of physical and human factors may have contributed to it and very advanced technical expertise is absolutely warranted to understand what went wrong. Otherwise, any conclusions become political grandstanding.\n\nAmerica currently sits at an energy crossroads. Technology and especially economics are many decades away from being anywhere near replacing or even significantly supplementing oil and gas as a means of fueling our economy; Nonetheless, federal policymakers stand on the precipice of enacting knee-jerk, politically motivated, and short-sighted restrictions that would constrain and hamper US energy production (and its accompanying jobs) for the foreseeable future. A dangerous combination, if ever there was one.\n\nThe administration and its advocates have voiced a desire to deal with this issue from an objective standpoint, bringing the best and the brightest technical minds to a vexing technical problem and simply fixing the leak. It makes for a great sound bite, but the White House\u2019s actions do not support their commitment to objectivity.\n\nWhat the administration must understand is that their actions have impacts that go beyond the political gains they see on the horizon. Their actions have damning economic repercussions in the Gulf region and dangerous implications for the future of our nation\u2019s energy portfolio. Look no further than the president\u2019s (recently overturned) decision to place a moratorium on offshore drilling, a politically-motivated decision that seemed to completely ignore real-world implications for the people of the Gulf and idled rigs, stopped production, and took away one of the region\u2019s most critical employers and revenue generators--offshore production.\n\nThis is exactly the sort of behavior that needs to be avoided in the wake of the spill and exactly why the partisan and biased nature of Lazarus and the rest of the commission\u2019s members are so troubling.\n\nTo effectively address the catastrophe in the Gulf, we need our leaders to remove political bias, carefully examine complex technical processes, and safeguard against wrongs both environmental and economic.\n\nThe Gulf region is already suffering through one man-made disaster resulting from this unfortunate and likely preventable tragedy. If drilling commission\u2019s appointees act based on their apparent ideologies, there is a very real possibility that they will ultimately inflict yet another, orders of magnitude bigger, man-made economic catastrophe on their own.",

It outlined a series of measures the alliance would take to help Georgia rebuild and ultimately bring it into the embrace of the West.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said NATO would coordinate assistance to what he said were more than 150,000 Georgians displaced by the fighting. The alliance, he said in a news conference, would dispatch experts to assess damage to Georgia's infrastructure and armed forces.\n\nBut with no sign that the Russians have begun a full-scale withdrawal from Georgian territory -- days after pledging to do so -- diplomats privately described the document as an indication of the limits of what NATO's diverse membership would agree to beyond denunciation.\n\nThe Russians themselves appeared to ridicule the declaration. While Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters the document was a \"clear indication of NATO's interest and NATO's concern,\" Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's envoy to the alliance, assessed in his own news conference that \"the mountain gave birth to a mouse.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also dismissed NATO's declaration, the Associated Press reported, saying the alliance was trying to make a victim of Georgia's \"criminal regime.\" Georgia's desire for NATO membership is strongly opposed by Russia.\n\nThough Rice said the United States got precisely what it wanted in the declaration, a German diplomat said that his government did not consider NATO the best place to discuss a global response to the Georgian crisis.\n\nSome of NATO's newest members -- including those formerly part of the Soviet Union -- called for a more robust statement, the diplomat said. But \"Georgia is not a member of NATO,\" the diplomat said. \"What can NATO do?\"\n\nThe cease-fire negotiated last week by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and signed over the weekend by Russian President Dmitry Medvedyev, called for Russian troops to return to their positions of Aug. 6, before they flooded from Russia through the separatist zone of South Ossetia and into undisputed Georgian cities and towns.\n\nThe demand in NATO's Tuesday declaration for a Russian withdrawal covers troops who crossed from Russia as part of the war. It does not cover several hundred Russian soldiers who were stationed on disputed Georgian land as peacekeepers prior to the escalation.\n\nNATO hopes that U.N. action will result in an international peacekeeping force deploying to the two disputed areas of Georgia.\n\nThe declaration welcomed an agreement, reached between Georgia and Russia this Tuesday at the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to expand a small group of unarmed OSCE military monitors on the ground in Georgia from nine to 29. OSCE Chairman Alexander Stubb said that the monitors -- eventually to number 100 -- would initially be deployed only in areas in Georgia proper \"adjacent\" to South Ossetia and the other disputed enclave, Abkhazia.\n\nCalling Georgia a \"valued and long-standing Partner of NATO,\" the alliance's declaration said a NATO-Georgian commission would be formed to help Georgia move toward eventual membership. But it made no mention of fast-tracking action on Georgia's application.\n\nUntil the Georgia situation is resolved, Scheffer said he saw no indication that the NATO-Russian Council, established in 2002 to facilitate cooperation, would convene. In an indication of NATO's inability to agree on specific steps, he said that \"no specific decisions on projects or programs have been taken.\"",

The casual observer of the business scene might easily be forgiven for concluding that any technology is high technology. These days, most executives -and virtually all of those in public relations - refer to their enterprises' technology as high technology, if they refer to it at all.\n\nThere are many reasons for the term's popularity: First, the growing public sentiment that new technology is all too often a mixed blessing at best has led to a kind of linguistic inflation. Some business executives seem to feel that, if technology does not go so far as it once did in impressing the public, something more is needed - high technology.\n\nA second reason is that the term seems to be irresistibly attractive to investors. Companies with reputations as hightechnology concerns trade on Wall Street at high multiples of their earnings per share. For example, leading companies in the business of applying computers to design problems and manufacturing processes (known as the CAD/CAM business) have traded at 40 to 50 times earnings.\n\nNevertheless, evidence occasionally pops up to indicate that high technology has not yet become entirely synonymous with technology in general.

Danforth, vice chairman and chief operating officer of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, had to field a question at a stock analysts' meeting here about technology developments in a division that makes furniture and room-dividing arrangements for offices.\n\nGroping slightly, he distinguished the technology involved from the high technology of Westinghouse's defense and energy businesses, and the company's interest in industrial robots, by describing it as ''straightforward.''\n\nGene Strull, manager of advanced technical laboratories at Westinghouse's defense plant in Baltimore, wryly addressed the problem of what distinguishes high technology at a recent technology seminar in Pittsburgh:\n\n''My friends say, 'I know what high technology is - everything you talk about is over my head.' ''Customers say, 'High technology means that everything you want to sell us is in an embryonic stage and is high-priced.' '' But, Mr. Strull concluded, high technology really refers to the technology development that is taking place in an area where changes occur rapidly. ''It's as though Columbus set out to rig the Santa Maria and, before he got the sails up, someone invented the steam engine.''\n\nOne hallmark of high technology, Mr. Strull said, is that development and pricing of systems incorporating it is extremely difficult. A system using sophisticated electronics might be changed several times during its development, as improvements in microelectronic components make new features possible. The system developer needs to maintain as many options for insertion of the technological advances as possible while still moving forward. In short, in the world of high technology, an accurate final cost picture may emerge very late in the game, and the chances of ending up with a product that is outdated before it gets to market are high.\n\nIn most cases, the higher risks associated with high-technology endeavors are accompanied by the possibility of high returns. Those who correctly positioned themselves at the cutting edge of the computer industry it developed made immense fortunes. Some of those entering the race to engineer new life forms through gene-splicing will no doubt do the same.\n\nHigh technology, in addition to being complex and risky, is frequently exotic. Gene splicers tinker with the building blocks of life. But the gene splicers have plenty of less-publicized company when it comes to work with the inner structures of the natural world.\n\nConsider the metallurgists. During the 1960's, they discovered that crystalline metals, which have very regular atomic structures, can be rearranged into random forms. The trick is to freeze them directly from their liquid state by cooling them rapidly.\n\nThe resulting metals, called amorphous metals, resist corrosion because it is more difficult for oxygen molecules to penetrate their surface and they are unusually strong. They have magnetic properties that make them excellent candidates to reduce energy consumption in transformers used in the electricity distribution grid, according to a study by the Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nHowever, like many of the recognized branches of high technology, amorphous metals are still more notable for their potential than their impact. Ironically, by the time the relative importance of the various high technologies recognized today is clear, they might not be high technologies. History shows that jargon tends to evolve.\n\nWhat comes after high technology? If marketing departments are consulted, it could be ultrahigh technology or new, improved high technology. Engineers tend to be more prosaic. Large-scale integrated circuits (LSIC's in the electronics trade) are on the verge of being replaced by very large-scale integrated circuits (VLSIC's). Very high technology?",

            "answer": "WHAT is high technology? The casual observer of the business scene might easily be forgiven for concluding that any technology is high technology. These days, most executives -and virtually all of those in public relations - refer to their enterprises' technology as high technology, if they refer to it at all.   There are many reasons for the term's popularity: First, the growing public sentiment that new technology is all too often a mixed blessing at best has led to a kind of linguistic inflation. Some business executives seem to feel that, if technology does not go so far as it once did in impressing the public, something more is needed - high technology."

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

(CBC)\n\nSo a teenager will attempt riskier behaviours, Schafer says.\n\n\"What we have seen is the teen brain is actually wired evolutionarily to take risk and to excitement seek. It's sort of a Darwinian thing that says this is the age as a species you are asking the approaching adult to leave the security of the family social unit and to venture out \u2014 basically flock from the nest,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm sure every parent can probably dig back in their memory and think of something where they go: 'There but for the grace of God go I, if I would have gone two miles an hour faster or didn't stop three seconds earlier,\" she said.\n\n\"We've all done boneheaded things and survived. This is just one of those cases where it didn't work out.\"\n\nSchafer says teens are good at recognizing risks in their actions, but often take part anyway. Add in peer pressure and there's a problem.\n\nFlowers are placed on a fence near the start area for the bobsled track after Saturday's incident on the track that left two teenagers dead and six injured at Canada Olympic Park in Calgary. (Larry MacDougal/Canadian Press)\n\n\"I bet those eight teens made a different decision than if one teen went up there alone.\"\n\nSchafer advises parents to try to find activities for their kids that involve the feeling of risk without the danger, such as sports or public performance.\n\nThe superintendent of Westmount Charter School where twins Jordan and Evan Caldwell attended, says he hopes that students will learn from this sad event.\n\n\"It's important for us to remember that the students involved in this event are teenagers. They make some decisions about the kind of activities they want to get involved in. Sometimes it will be a bad decision which can lead to a tragic ending,\" says Joe Frank.\n\n\"I think we need to have our students as much as possible think it can happen to anybody \u2014 it can happen to them.\"",

Others say that he is important to the evangelical movement that he helped create when he established the Virginia Beach-based Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960, but that he needs to stop damaging it with his words.\n\nHe canceled a speech planned for Tuesday at the closing banquet of the National Religious Broadcasters convention in Dallas after NRB leaders said they were worried that his appearance could detract from the event.\n\n\"He is in a very visible leadership position, and comments such as recent ones related to Mr. Sharon and so many others are misinformed and presumptuous and border on arrogance,\" said David S. Dockery, president of Union University, a private college affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention. \"It puts the evangelical movement in a bad light.\"\n\nRobertson, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed.\n\nHe apologized after facing swift condemnation for his Jan. 5 statement that Sharon was punished for \"dividing God's land.\"\n\nRichard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and religious liberty commission, has said he was \"appalled that Pat Robertson would claim to know the mind of God concerning whether particular tragic events . . . were the judgments of God.\"\n\nBarry Hankins, professor of history and church-state studies at Baylor University, said Robertson tries to interpret contemporary events as \"being part of the drama of God's activity in the world.\"\n\nBrian Britt, director of the religious studies program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, said Robertson's remarks are not just \"off-the-wall\" but part of a strategy that earns him headlines.\n\nWhen people attack Robertson, he wins sympathy for appearing to be an underdog, Britt said. \"It reinforces an image of Christianity as a persecuted religion, a religion that is being hounded by the secularists,\" he said.",

It was that simple. And that wondrous.\n\nIn eight seasons on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Hartman did hundreds of them. Males, females and gender-uncertains. He played moguls and mutants. He played suave ladies' men and girly-men, dictators and saviors.\n\nHe could do anything, so the \"SNL\" writers and producers asked him to do everything.\n\nHe played Frankenstein's monster in sketches about creatures who couldn't communicate. He played Disney chairman Michael Eisner and Phil Donahue and Donald Trump and Ted Kennedy and Ed McMahon and Frank Sinatra and, of course, Bill Clinton. He played a she-male in the decadent German nightclub setting of the \"Sprockets\" sketches and a normally built human who was brutally ridiculed by the musclebound Hans and Franz.\n\nHartman was a wicked Barbara Bush, a thawed-out Neanderthal-turned-attorney known as the Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer and, in one of my favorite characterizations, Russell Clark, the senior editor of \"Sassy\" magazine, which Hartman always pronounced SASSSS-ie!!\n\nHis wizardry with characters made him a natural for \"The Simpsons,\" where cloying phonies like the obnoxious Troy McClure were a specialty. (\"Hi, my name is Troy McClure and you might know me from such movies as . . .\")\n\nHis not-quite-smarmy tone lent a peculiar kind of authority to the TV commercials he did for such advertisers as 1-800-COLLECT.\n\nIt was that tone that Hartman brought to Bill McNeal, the deceptively complex character he played on \"NewsRadio.\" On one level, Hartman performed the same service for the sitcom that he did for \"SNL\": Need a laugh? Write a line for Hartman. He'll take care of the rest.\n\nBut what was most remarkable about McNeal, and, indeed, about many of the characters he did for \"SNL,\" was the combination of qualities that Hartman somehow managed to pack into them.\n\nFirst, he always made sure the audience was in on the joke; whether he was playing Charlton Heston or Liberace, you never forgot that it was Hartman performing and performing for your benefit.\n\nSecond, no matter how goofy or dense or self-absorbed or idiotic or maddening the character and he played scores of such entities Hartman found a way to let you like them. It could be a raised eyebrow or a knowing smirk or even a brief, sudden flash of hurt, but one way or another, Hartman humanized his often infuriating and sometimes literally inhuman characters.\n\nThis was most apparent, as you'd expect, in McNeal on \"NewsRadio,\" the character he played the longest (since 1995), thus, had the most opportunity to explore. Hartman kept you off-balance with McNeal, never quite sure where he'd draw the line between unforgivably venal and touchingly vulnerable. Watching McNeal spar with Dave Foley's character of Dave Nelson was delightful, and watching McNeal dance tantalizingly with the emotions of Andy Dick's Matthew Brock was a kind of sitcom poetry.\n\nHartman did characters, and he did them with a brilliance that stood shoulder to shoulder with that of the great Sid Caesar and Jackie Gleason.\n\nHartman surely had more characters inside him; we'll miss the ones he didn't get time to show us, and we'll miss him.",

With low crude prices rendering shipping by train unprofitable, a growing share of the nation\u2019s rail capacity has been idled and major freight railroads have announced hundreds of layoffs.\n\nOverall, transportation and warehousing employment contracted by 5.300 jobs in February after the businesses cut 19,500 jobs in January.\n\nThe losses come as the overall job market added 242,000 jobs, led by industries including health care, retail and restaurant hiring that benefited from strong consumer spending. The warehousing sector, which has been growing faster than the overall job market for years, added 2,400 jobs in February and has added more than 50,000 jobs in the last 12 months.\n\nThe trucking industry, which had been expanding employment in recent months, lost 600 jobs in February.\n\nThe overall job growth eases fears that uncertainty in foreign markets could lead to a slowdown in the U.S. But the data also signals a shift in the U.S. economy toward services sectors, which isn\u2019t translating to higher wages. Wage growth significantly slowed in February compared with recent months, to 2.2% from a year earlier.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said manufacturers, which added 29,000 jobs in January, lost some of those gains last month with 16,000 fewer jobs. Good-producing jobs decreased by 15,000.\n\nThe Alliance for American Manufacturing industry group blamed the U.S. trade deficit with China for the sector\u2019s losses. \u201cWe\u2019ll never experience a true manufacturing resurgence in the United States unless we get trade policy right and get a lot tougher with China,\u201d Scott Paul, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n\nWrite to Loretta Chao at loretta.chao@wsj.com",

Kean of Livingston, a former Assembly Speaker, has a 1,681-vote lead over Representative James J. Florio, Democrat of Runnemede. Mr. Florio requested the recount of the Nov. 3 vote yesterday.\n\nThe candidates will be permitted to have two observers at the sites where the new tally is to be compiled. The recount will be done by the election boards in the state's 21 counties.\n\nThe recount will involve reopening all sealed voting machines, estimated at 5,250, and recording the gubernatorial votes registered on them. Since Nov. 4, the machines have been stored under 24-hour police guard in centralized locations in each of the counties. Counted By Hand\n\nIn addition, all absentee ballots, computer ballots and emergency paper ballots used when voting machines broke down will be counted by hand by clerks of the election boards. All of these ballots, estimated at about 184,500, had also been impounded.\n\nClive S. Cummis, a lawyer for Mr. Florio, said the recount would take from a week to a week and a half. The legal staffs for both candidates drafted the ground rules for the recount. Mr. Cummis was assisted by Timothy Downs, a Detroit lawyer who specializes in election recounts. Mr. Kean's lawyer, Irwin Kimmelman, had similar assistance from James Schoerner, an attorney from Washington.\n\nAmong other things, the rules specified that recounts of any local contests would await the finish of the gubernatorial recount; voting machines and emergency ballots would be counted first and absentee ballots second, and only election board officials would handle the ballots or machines. Question on Computer Cards\n\nMr. Kimmelman was unable to achieve guidelines for the computer punch-card ballots used in Gloucester, Warren, Sussex and Salem Counties. The rectangular punch-out tabs on the cards, called chads, are opposite each candidate's name and attached to the card at each corner.\n\nMr. Kimmelman wanted vote-validation rules set for a variety of instances in which the chads were not fully punched out, but were still attached to the ballot.\n\nFormer Justice Mark A. Sullivan of State Supreme Court, head of the three-man panel hearing challenges on the election, said that there were too many variables for which to set rules. Any disputes over the computer ballots not settled by a majority vote of the county election board will be referred to the panel for resolution, Justice Sullivan said.\n\nIf a county's new total differs from its earlier certified count, the new total will be returned to the county's election board by the judges for recertification. It also will be submitted to Donald Lan, the Secretary of State, for final state certification.\n\nIf the recount reverses the election in Mr. Florio's favor, Mr. Kean would challenge the recount only ''on the basis of fraud or miscalculation,'' said Carl Golden, a spokesman for Mr. Kean.\n\n''Mr. Kean is confident it will not change,'' Mr. Golden said.\n\nIllustrations: photo of judiciary panel ruling on recount",

While the devices and services description was helpful in starting our transformation, we now need to hone in on our unique strategy.\n\n\u201cAt our core, Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world,\u201d Nadella wrote.\n\nThe new boss sees Microsoft as having \u201ca unique ability to harmonize the world\u2019s devices, apps, docs, data and social networks in digital work and life experiences so that people are at the center and are empowered to do more and achieve more with what is becoming an increasingly scarce commodity \u2013 time!\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the XBox is going anywhere.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have Xbox in our family to go after this opportunity with unique and bold innovation,\u201d says Nadella. \u201cBottom line, we will continue to innovate and grow our fan base with Xbox while also creating additive business value for Microsoft.\u201d\n\nAnd Nadella sees a bigger role for Cortana, aka Microsoft\u2019s Siri. \u201cIn the future, it will be even more intelligent as a personal assistant who takes notes, books meetings and understands if my question about the weather is to determine my clothes for the day or is intended to start a complex task like booking a family vacation.\u201d\n\nNow, for the re-org part:\n\nNothing is off the table in how we think about shifting our culture to deliver on this core strategy. Organizations will change. Mergers and acquisitions will occur. Job responsibilities will evolve. New partnerships will be formed. Tired traditions will be questioned. Our priorities will be adjusted. New skills will be built. New ideas will be heard. New hires will be made. Processes will be simplified. And if you want to thrive at Microsoft and make a world impact, you and your team must add numerous more changes to this list that you will be enthusiastic about driving.\n\nYeah, there was talk of \u201ctaking actions to flatten the organization and develop leaner business processes.\u201d But few tech CEOs leaven that by dropping a Rainer Maria Rilke quote to soften the blow, as Nadella did Thursday: \u201cThe future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens.\u201d",

His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",

Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed.\n\nIt is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia.\n\nMany popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to \"cheat\" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether.\n\nAnton Nossik, who is considered Russia's \"internet guru\", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google.\n\n\"The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person\", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nEarlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation.\n\nIn March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government.\n\nIn a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests.\n\nEarlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor.\n\nFor many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws.\n\nHowever Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing \"CIA project\".\n\nHe also claimed that the popular Russian search engine Yandex was controlled by foreign intelligence.\n\nTwo years ago, Russia enacted a law enabling authorities to blacklist and force certain websites offline without a trial.\n\nThe government said the legislation was designed to protect children from harmful internet content, such as pro-suicide or pornography websites.\n\nOn Thursday, lawyers for US intelligence officer Edward Snowden said the whistleblower had filed for refugee status in Russia.\n\nMr Snowden received temporary shelter in Russia last year.\n\nHe had evaded US authorities after he leaked classified government documents revealing mass surveillance programmes undertaken by the NSA in the US and GCHQ in the UK.",

In recent days, top Yemeni officials have publicly played down their growing ties to Washington, fearing that they will be perceived by their opponents as weak and beholden to the United States.\n\nAlimi, speaking at a crowded news conference Thursday, also said that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian who allegedly tried to bomb an American airliner on Christmas Day, had likely met with Yemeni American cleric Anwar al-Aulaqi. Aulaqi is also linked to Nidal M. Hasan, the U.S. Army major who is charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., on Nov 5.\n\nSome news organizations reported definitively that Abdulmutallab had met with Aulaqi, while others translated Alimi's comments in Arabic to mean that the pair \"likely met.\"\n\nDiscussing Abdulmutallab's stay last year in Yemen, Alimi echoed an account he gave The Washington Post in an interview last week. He said Abdulmutallab had traveled to Shabwa province, where he likely met with al-Qaeda operatives in a house owned by Aulaqi.\n\nAbdulmutallab arrived in Yemen in August, ostensibly to study at an Arabic-language school in the capital, Sanaa. School officials said he left the school in late September, clutching an exit visa. But authorities believe that instead of leaving Yemen, he traveled to Shabwa. The Nigerian left Yemen on Dec. 4, Alimi said.\n\nU.S. investigators say they think that the airliner plot originated in Yemen and that Abdulmutallab received chemical explosives and training during his stay in the country.\n\nBut Alimi asserted Thursday that Abdulmutallab had received the chemical explosives for the failed attack in Nigeria. It was unclear how the engineering graduate could have received explosives there: Flight records show that he spent four hours in the Lagos airport on Dec. 24 before boarding a KLM flight to Amsterdam. He then boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 bound for Detroit.\n\nAsked what proof he had that the explosives were obtained in Nigeria, Alimi replied: \"That question should be directed at the Nigerian authorities and the Dutch government. It's not related to the Yemeni security apparatus.\"\n\nIn an extensive accounting of a Dec. 17 U.S.-backed operation, the Yemeni government said its security forces \"had seized a group of terrorists\" in possession of the same explosives used in an attempted assassination of Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in August, according to a report published by the state-run Saba news agency this week.\n\nInvestigators say they think such explosives were also used in the attempted airliner bombing, in which Abdulmutallab is charged with trying to detonate chemical powders that were sewn into his underwear.",

It indicated the president with a three point advantage over Romney among likely Minnesota voters. Forty-seven percent of respondents said they would back the president and 44% said they support Romney. Obama's advantage was within the survey's 3.5 percentage point sampling error.\n\nThe poll also showed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson with 2% support of likely voters in the state.\n\nSunday's poll \u2013 paired with small ad buys by the Obama and Romney campaigns in Minnesota \u2013 suggest a tightening race in a state that turned out overwhelmingly for then-Illinois Sen. Obama in 2008. Obama took 54% of the vote in Minnesota four years ago, compared to 44% that went to Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nThe last Republican presidential candidate to win Minnesota was Richard Nixon in 1972. The state carries a prize of ten electoral votes.\n\nRepublican's believe there is some movement in Minnesota toward the GOP while Democrats billed the ad buy as a ploy to generate buzz about a close race that does not exist.\n\nOn a conference call Monday, top Obama adviser David Axelrod said the Obama team was \"not going to surrender any territory there,\" but said he was confident of a win in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nAn earlier poll from St. Cloud State University, taken from October 15-21 and released Friday, indicated Obama with an eight point edge over Romney, 53% to Romney's 45%.

Atiyeh of Oregon, a Republican, appears to be in a solid position to win renomination in his state's primary elections today after a campaign in which he kept his distance from the Reagan Administration's economic policies.\n\nMr. Atiyeh served 20 years in the Oregon Legislature as a representative from Portland before he was elected Governor in 1978. While he was a state administrator, his image shifted from conservative toward the center. The best known among his four opponents for the nomination is Walter Huss, a former Republican state chairman, who represents the party's conservative wing. Polls indicate that Governor Atiyeh is well liked; in January, for example, he drew 62 percent approval to 26 percent disapproval.\n\nThree Democrats dominate the seven-candidate race for the Democratic nomination for governor. Don Clark, Multnomah County executive, and Ted Kulongoski, a State Senator from the Eugene area, appear in the polls to have narrow leads over Jerry Rust of Eugene, a Lane County commissioner.\n\nMr. Clark's 20-year political career has all been in the Portland area, and he has not yet made a statewide campaign. Mr. Kulongoski in 1980 was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate and was defeated by the Republican, Bob Packwood. Lumber Industry a Big Factor\n\nThe most important political consideration in Oregon this year is the collapse of the lumber industry, which Oregon voters ascribe to a slump in new home construction caused by high interest rates.\n\nGovernor Atiyeh carried this logic another step in a letter to President Reagan on March 25. The letter protested the prospect of a Federal budget deficit in the $100 billion range. He told Mr. Reagan such a deficit would push interest rates higher and prolong the recession, which brought unemployment here to 11.3 percent.\n\nOregon now has four seats in the House of Representatives, but will get a fifth in January. Denny Smith, now in the Second District, the only Republican in the delegation, will continue to live in Salem, which is in the new Fifth District. Three Expect Renomination\n\nRon Wyden of Portland, Les AuCoin of suburban Portland and James Weaver of Eugene, all Democrats, expect to be renominated. The Second District, which covers 73,000 square miles running from the Columbia River to California and across the southern tier of counties to the Pacific, has witnessed hard-fought races for both nominations. The Republican contenders are the Curry County Commissioner, Mike Fitzgerald of Gold Beach, who asserts ''I am the Reagan Republican,'' and State Senator Bob Smith of Burns. The leading Democratic contenders are Larryann Willis of Vale, a member of the Democratic National Committee, and Mayor Al Densmore of Medford.\n\nWhile Oregon is a leader in direct legislation by voters, there are only five ballot measures this election. The most controversial is a proposal to issue $60 million in state bonds to build state and local prisons. Another would authorize the Governor to name the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, who now is elected by his colleagues on the Court. A gas tax increase to 9 cents from 8 cents a gallon this year, with another penny increase in each of the next two years, is thought to be headed for defeat. ---- Races in Pennsylvania By The Associated Press\n\nGov. Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania and John Heinz, the state's senior United States Senator, are running unopposed in a Republican primary today.\n\nVoters in the three counties around the Three Mile Island nuclear plant are holding a nonbinding referendum on whether the facility's undamaged reactor should be started up. Nunzio J. Palladino, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has said the Federal panel would take the vote into account when deciding the reactor's fate.\n\nThe Republican's opposition in the gubernatorial race this fall will come from a field of four Democrats, led by Representative Allen E. Ertel, who won three House terms in a predominantly Republican district.\n\nBoth Governor Thornburgh and Senator Heinz have raised more than $1 million, primarily for use in the fall. ''There's no campaign, not now,'' the Governor said recently.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Victor G. Atiyeh",

That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image.\n\n'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.'\n\nMr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services.\n\nThe prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack.\n\nHe believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures.\n\n'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said.\n\nMr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation.\n\nThe prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right)\n\n'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.'\n\nHundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain.\n\nHis comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group.\n\nWaheed Ahmed, 21 \u2013 the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed \u2013 is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS.\n\nAhmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by Turkish police at the border town of Reyhanli last week. He was one of a group of nine detained, all from Rochdale, including four children aged from one to 11.\n\nThey could be flown back to the UK today.\n\nNafir Afzal last month quit the CPS despite being cleared of allegations suggesting he texted a defendant in a case.\n\nIn the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS.\n\nMr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences.\n\nThis included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions.\n\nHe said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice.\n\nMore recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall.\n\nHe also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse.\n\nThe prosecutor last year claimed that there would be a fresh wave of Operation Yewtree arrests concerning the abuse of children by celebrities.\n\nHe said: 'This is a growing industry. There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some are very high-profile figures.'\n\nMr Afzal began his CPS career in central London and went on to be awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

(Charlie Neibergal/Associated Press)\n\n\"In light of the final ruling, and due to the fact that the United States has continued to discriminate against Canadian livestock products, Canada will be seeking authority from the WTO to use retaliatory measures on U.S. agricultural and non-agricultural products,\" a statement from the two ministries said.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers are taking that possibility seriously, and are already taking steps to introduce a bill that would repeal the law currently on the books ahead of any retaliatory sanctions.\n\nThe measure was blamed for a drastic decline in meat exports from Canada and Mexico.\n\nOttawa reckons the labeling requirements have cost Canadian meat producers about $1 billion annually since being implemented in 2008. The impact on Mexico has been about the same.\n\nIt's the fourth similar ruling from the WTO against the U.S. in the issue, and long past time to move on, the chair of the Canadian Pork Council says.\n\n\"The U.S. has now lost four times at the WTO and has no other appeal options,\" Rick Bergmann said. \"It is time that the negative impact \u2026 is recognized by Congress and that they fix the legislation.\"",

Roberts Jr. told the attorneys to keep arguing -- and fellow justices kept pulling out copies of the Constitution and peppering the lawyers with questions -- long after the arguments in a complex case known as Medellin v. Texas were scheduled to come to an end yesterday.\n\nThe case began with a horrific rape and murder committed by Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Medell\u00edn and others in 1993. But it has moved far beyond Texas's death row to complicated questions about whether the president or an international court has the power to determine the rights U.S. courts afford criminal defendants.\n\nRoberts was one of several justices who seemed skeptical of the deference owed to the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court. He asked Medill\u00edn's lawyer, Donald F. Donovan: If the Supreme Court thought a World Court ruling preempted federal law, \"We would have no authority to review the judgment itself?\"\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia agreed, saying he has a constitutional problem with giving an international body such power. \"I am rather jealous of that authority,\" Scalia said. \"I don't know on what basis we can allow some international court to decide what is the responsibility of this court, which is the meaning of the United States law.\"\n\nMedell\u00edn, 33, has lived in the United States since he was 3; he speaks and writes English but is still a Mexican national. He was part of a gang that attacked Jennifer Ertman, 14, and Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a, 16, as the girls walked home from a friend's house. The girls were raped and murdered, one of them strangled with her own shoestring.\n\nMedell\u00edn signed a waiver of his Miranda right to remain silent and confessed within hours of his arrest. But he was not told of his right to talk to the consulate of his country, guaranteed to those arrested outside their home countries, under the Vienna Convention. Medell\u00edn did not raise that right during his trial but did in one of his death penalty appeals.\n\nMexico, which has no death penalty, went to the International Court of Justice, and it ruled that the death sentences of 51 Mexican nationals in nine states, including Medell\u00edn's, receive \"review and reconsideration.\"\n\nThe Bush administration first argued against Mexico, then President Bush in 2005 issued a memorandum to the attorney general saying that the United States will \"discharge its international obligations . . . by having state courts give effect to the decision\" of the World Court.\n\nBush's home state said no. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said Bush's directive exceeded his authority, and to give Medell\u00c2\u00bfn an additional hearing would violate the state's judicial procedures.\n\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer were most supportive of Bush's desire to comply with the guarantees of treaties and the ruling of the international court.\n\n\"The United States gave its promise,\" Ginsburg said. \"It voluntarily accepted this jurisdiction. It didn't have to.\"\n\nBreyer pulled out a copy of the Constitution and read a portion that said state judges must comply with U.S. treaties -- \"I guess it means, including Texas.\"\n\nSolicitor General Paul D. Clement, who joined Medell\u00edn's side, distanced himself from the argument that the treaties alone would mean the court must follow the World Court's directive. The president's agreement with the World Court is the \"critical element,\" Clement said.\n\nBut Texas Solicitor General R. Ted Cruz said Bush had no authority to issue a memorandum ordering a state court to do something its laws do not authorize -- in this case, another hearing for Medell\u00edn.\n\nThe lively debate drew in all the justices, save Justice Clarence Thomas, who maintained his customary silence. At one point, the fray grew such that Justice John Paul Stevens asked Cruz to clarify a point -- and then asked colleagues not to interrupt until Cruz finished.",

Its followup last fall, Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate, got the wheels mostly back on track, but the bloom was off the rose. You may, understandably, have given it a pass, in other words.\n\nNow\u2019s your chance to circle back. For those rocking Sony\u2019s new PlayStation 4 Pro (see our review) and a 4K television (see our buyer\u2019s guide), it seems Ubisoft\u2019s snuck out a patch that adds 4K support to the game. Version 1.50, noticed by NeoGAF, doesn\u2019t appear to be doing anything else. But it may be a welcome gift for PS4 Pro owners, and further indication that developers may be quietly mulling updates to other extant titles.\n\nEmphasis may be. The patch notes are feature-specific: \u201cAdded 4K support on PlayStation 4 Pro.\u201d That would imply something greater than native 1080p support, and that you\u2019d need a 4K television to enjoy the extra pixel bounty. The original PlayStation 4 game rendered at 900p. Does the PS4 Pro version render at greater than 1080p?\n\nI\u2019ve installed the patch and futzed around Southwark, and it\u2019s not clear the game looks any better. Distant objects \u2014 brick facades, industrial smokestacks, discrete stones in roads and mortared walls viewed from five or six stories up \u2014 seem better delineated and less prone to shimmering when swiveling the view. But that could just be the way my new 4K television\u2019s upscaling the picture, not the game itself.\n\nSome at GAF seem to think the patch is just a user interface upscale, and that the game itself is still rendering at the original 900p resolution. Even if it\u2019s been bumped to native 1080p, the patch note language is worrisome, since it specifies 4K, which implies pixel counts minimally greater than 1080p. No one\u2019s expecting native 4K support from the PS4 Pro, but 1080p support has nothing to do with 4K screens. You could, in other words, enjoy the salient benefits on a plain old 1080p screen.\n\nAnd so we\u2019re left to squirm over the PS4 Pro\u2019s Achilles heel: that, absent studio transparency, it\u2019s left to message board guessing and face-off reverse engineering to articulate what developers themselves could, and ought to be doing, by releasing these things with a few simple lines of elucidation.",

Hassell said it\u2019s the investment managers hired by the pension funds that have that duty.\n\n\u201cThe investment managers are the ones who make the decision to use us or not, and they\u2019re actually the ones who bear the fiduciary responsibility to act well on behalf of their clients,\u2019\u2019 Hassell said during a question-and-answer session with reporters. He suggested that they all knew they were paying convenience store prices for this type of foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cThey understand the program very, very well,\u2019\u2019 Hassell said.\n\nHe declined to say whether settlement talks were progressing between BNY Mellon and prosecutors in New York who have sued the company for $2 billion in alleged foreign exchange overcharging.\n\nMassachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin last month filed a civil lawsuit against the bank, alleging that it had defrauded the Massachusetts state pension fund of $29 million over a decade.\n\nOf the Massachusetts case, Hassell said, \u201cWe\u2019re basically defending ourselves because, again, we think we provided a valuable service at a fair price.\u201d\n\nHassell, 59, took over as chief executive of BNY Mellon last August, after the foreign exchange battles had already become public, following complaints filed by Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. Hassell was previously president of the company; he succeeded Robert P. Kelly, who had a falling out with the board over the company\u2019s direction.\n\nHassell during his speech painted a grim portrait of the global economy and suggested that the government should \u201chit the pause button\u201d on new financial regulations, while the industry adapts to new rules that have already been passed under Dodd-Frank.\n\nAsked about Rep. Barney Frank\u2019s announced retirement, he said he and Frank often did not see eye-to-eye, but that \u201che\u2019s been an incredible patriot for our country.\u201d\n\nHassell said BNY Mellon was cutting costs around the world, particularly in areas related to technology.

DeGiacomo, said Upper Crust shut restaurants Monday night because it had just four days of supplies and only $14,000 in cash after company executives paid themselves a month\u2019s salary in advance.\n\nThe business, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month, needs $120,000 to keep doors open. If the company can obtain funding within few days, it could avoid a permanent shutdown. So far, Upper Crust has closed 10 of 16 locations.\n\n\u201cWe do hope that if an investor comes forward, the stores could reopen,\u201d DeGiacomo said. \u201cAs a trustee, my job is to sell the business any way \u2014 either sell it open or sell it closed.\u201d\n\nNo one answered the phones at Upper Crust locations on Newbury Street in Boston, Hingham, Lexington, and Wellesley. Some restaurants, including those in Boston\u2019s Fenway and South End neighborhoods, are routing orders to locations in Beacon Hill and Brookline, which are operated separately by company founder Jordan Tobins and are not part of the bankruptcy. Four other franchise stores, in Newburyport, Plymouth, West Roxbury, and Porstmouth, N.H., remain open as well.\n\nTobins, who opened the first Upper Crust store in 2001 on Beacon Hill, was placed on leave earlier this year. The chain\u2019s co-owners, Brendan Higgins and Joshua Huggard, sued him for allegedly misusing company funds. Tobins \u2014 with the help of a separate business partner \u2014 is attempting to get funding to reopen the other stores and is making a proposal to the trustee, according to Tobins\u2019s lawyer, Rick Mikels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible what\u2019s happened. We\u2019d like to see the stores reopen immediately,\u201d Mikels said.\n\nLawyers for Huggard and Higgins did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe turn of events marks a swift unraveling for the pizza empire, which gained a loyal foodie following and expanded to more than 20 locations across the region. But the company cut corners with expenses and relied on a supply of immigrant workers from the impoverished village of Marilac in Brazil, according to a Globe investigation published in 2010. The Brazilian employees say they were underpaid for long work weeks and faced tough working conditions.\n\nThe US Department of Labor first investigated the company in 2009 and ordered Upper Crust to pay workers about $350,000 in back wages. Several employees, in a class-action lawsuit, said they were forced by company executives to give back the federally mandated payments or lose their jobs.\n\nUpper Crust owes workers about $850,000 in back wages and damages, according to court records filed recently by the Department of Labor. A second federal investigation of pay practices at the Boston business between 2009 and 2011 found it violated minimum-wage and overtime laws and failed to pay 67 employees roughly $425,000 during that period.\n\nUpper Crust, which defaulted on a TD Bank loan in late September, said it owes at least $3.4 million to creditors, including more than $500,000 to ZVI Construction Co. in Brookline, about $235,000 to a food distributor, and $230,000 to a former state attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly, who represented the business after leaving office, according to a list filed last month in court.\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy, company executives said they had enough money to continue operating but later drastically revised the amount of cash on hand. DeGiacomo said Tuesday that the company had not made employee health insurance payments since August, and did not set aside money for state meals taxes. He also said the co-owners, Huggard and Higgins, and the company\u2019s chief financial officer paid themselves a month\u2019s salary in advance on Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just disgraceful,\u201d said Shannon Liss-Riordan, who represents the workers in the class-action lawsuit and sits on the creditors committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a further reflection of their lack of regard for their workers that they would pay themselves first and put 140 of their workers on the street.\u201d",

Many photographers referred to him as the Savior. The more concision-minded simply called him God.\n\nWhen the shop went out of business in 2001 (Mr. Forscher had sold it to colleagues when he retired in 1987), the photographic community heaved a collective shudder of panic.\n\nWhether one\u2019s camera had plunged into the sea, fallen from a skyscraper, been smashed in a riot or been otherwise sorely treated, Mr. Forscher could almost always find a solution. He knew, for instance, when to give a camera a bath (after an unplanned ocean dip, to flush out the saltwater), when to take it to the gas station (after the curative freshwater bath, to blow out the residue with the compressed-air hose), and when to bake it in the oven (after returning from the gas station, to dry out any lingering moisture).\n\nPresiding over a staff of specialists \u2014 Nikon men, Leica men, Hasselblad men, movie-camera men \u2014 Mr. Forscher, in his red apron, was a learned generalist. An accomplished inventor, he adapted equipment so his clients could capture better pictures atop tall buildings, beneath the sea, on the battlefield and inside the human body.\n\nHis best-known invention, patented in 1982, was the Pro-Back, a Polaroid attachment for a 35-millimeter camera that gave photographers an immediate proof print, letting them test a shot without having to wait for the film to be developed. Mr. Forscher also created an early compact motor drive for still cameras.\n\nMartin Hubert Forscher was born in Manhattan on Nov. 25, 1921. His father, a furrier and gambler, ran off with his bookkeeper when Marty was about 6, leaving his mother to weather the Depression by selling lingerie door to door in financial district offices.\n\nAfter graduating from Stuyvesant High School, Marty entered the City College of New York intending to become a doctor, but left before graduating to help support his mother. He found a job as an errand boy for a downtown camera shop and before long was fixing cameras.\n\nIn World War II, Mr. Forscher worked in Washington as a repairman for the Navy photographic unit run by the eminent photographer Edward Steichen. After the war, he opened Professional Camera Repair Service. Originally at 480 Lexington Avenue in Midtown, the shop was located for many years afterward at 37 West 47th Street.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Mr. Forscher began begging discarded cameras from magazines, fixing them and sending them South. There, members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee used them to document the civil rights movement in images published in newspapers and magazines around the world. Some were of signal events, like Bloody Sunday \u2014 March 7, 1965 \u2014 when state troopers beat black marchers in Selma, Ala. Others captured small daily victories, like a black child learning to read at a Mississippi Freedom School.\n\nWhen the cameras were dashed to the ground or drenched by police fire hoses, Mr. Forscher repaired them and sent them back again.\n\nBesides his wife, the former Marian Hamilton, whom he married in 1945, Mr. Forscher is survived by two sons, Paul and Gregg, and a grandchild.\n\nSince 1990, the Marty Forscher Fellowship has been awarded to students and young professionals specializing in humanistic documentary photography. The fellowship is given annually by Photo District News, a trade publication, and Parsons the New School for Design.\n\nIn reminiscences on the Web last week, clients also paid tribute to Mr. Forscher\u2019s Holmesian deductive abilities. Some years ago, as recounted in a posting to The Online Photographer, a photo-news site, a man walked into Mr. Forscher\u2019s shop wearing a Pentax MX and a pained look.\n\n\u201cWithout batting an eye,\u201d the posting continued, \u201cthis impish, graying, stoop-shouldered guy looks at my face, looks at the camera and says: \u2018Lemme guess. The diodes flicker in the finder and jump all over the place when you meter.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Forscher was spot-on, and there was a reason. A few days before, he had seen another customer with the same camera, the same problem and precisely the same facial expression.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on October 11, 2009, on Page A34 of the New York edition with the headline: Marty Forscher, 87, Dies; Tended Cameras and Owners.

They are Labour\u2019s Maquis. Small cells of heroic men and women who have pledged to fight for the country, and party, they love.\n\nToday they broke cover for the first time with \u201cIn the Black\u201d, a discussion paper advancing the radical proposition that fiscal probity and social justice need not be sworn enemies. \u201cThere is nothing right wing about fiscal conservatism,\u201d it argues. \u201cIt simply means that those from whom the state borrows can have absolute confidence that it will meet its obligations to repay, come what may. This means adopting an approach which is careful, risk averse, and cautious. More importantly, Labour\u2019s ability to advance social justice can go hand-in-hand with a clear, fiscally conservative stance\u201d.\n\nWithin today\u2019s Labour party, this is brave, some would say foolhardy stuff. The authors \u2013 an academic, lecturer, writer and spin doctor \u2013 are only too aware of the risks being taken. They face reprisals; accusations of betrayal. Denunciation by neighbours and former friends.\n\nBut they will not be deterred. \u201cLabour\u2019s principal political task is to demonstrate to people, as well as to convince itself, that it can be trusted to govern in this era of fiscal constraint and that it has a compelling project for economic and social reform within that demanding context. The reality of our fiscal situation means that any future Labour government must look to reforms rather than spending to advance centre-left goals.\u201d\n\nThe member\u2019s of Labour\u2019s secret army are not under any illusion. They know one document will not change the course of the argument within their party, nor result in an overnight shift in Labour\u2019s economic stance. It is the political equivalent of blowing up a railway bridge, not the start of a second front.\n\nBut they do sense a growing unease within Labour ranks over the inability to capitalise on the cascade of dire economic news. And they have some powerful friends.\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is Ed Balls economic strategy is hurting but it isn\u2019t working,\u201d said one shadow cabinet member, \u201cGeorge Osborne stood up and delivered the worst economic assessment for a generation this week and we had absolutely no impact. Frankly, it\u2019s criminal.\u201d\n\nThese fears have been fuelled by polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s statement. Since July George Osborne has increased his lead over Ed Balls as the best Chancellor. The number of people who think the Government is \u201cmanaging the economy well\u201d actually rose following his statement. Some 37 per cent of those asked thought the economy would be doing worse under Labour, compared to 25 per cent who thought it would be doing better. And the coalition enjoys an 11-point lead over the question, who is trusted to \u201csteer the economy through the economic crisis\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe shadow cabinet is now basically split into two camps: those who believe all we need is one more heave on the economy, and those who think we have to fundamentally change our position,\u201d said an insider. The number of senior Labour MPs who fall into the second camp is now growing steadily. \u201cIt\u2019s noticeable over the past month how many senior back benchers are saying we can\u2019t go on like this,\u201d said one source.\n\nIn fairness to Ed Balls, the chief architect of Labour\u2019s bullish economic strategy, there is a growing realisation even among his own inner circle that while their man has won his battle to expose the failure of the Government\u2019s Plan A, they are yet to make headway in the broader economic and political war. They feel this is partly due to the legacy of Labour\u2019s last tortuous years in office. But they also acknowledge they must find a way of shifting the terms of the debate to recapture the reputation for prudence Balls worked so diligently to construct in the run up to the 1997 election. \u201cThis is Ed Balls were talking about,\u201d said one back bench ally. \u201cHe loves Prudence. When no one else in the party would give her a second look it was Ed buying her flowers and taking her to dinner.\u201d\n\nThe question is how to win her back? Some people see this week\u2019s admission from George Osborne that deficit reduction will straddle the next election as an opportunity. They believe it gives Balls more time to flesh out, and toughen, his own strategy. Though they remain wary of providing another hostage to fortune by reproducing Labour\u2019s infamous 1992 shadow budget.\n\nOthers see the possibilities, but are sceptical about whether Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor is truly committed to seizing them. \u201cThere\u2019s no point saying we\u2019ll get the deficit down on the same timetable as Osborne if we\u2019re still banging on about more borrowing and more spending,\u201d said a shadow cabinet insider, \u201cif we\u2019re going to start talking the language of cuts, responsibility and hard choices then we\u2019re in with a chance.\u201d\n\nA handful of dark silhouettes stand framed in the moonlight.

The Agriculture Department said the step could save $700 million in the fiscal year 1982 because the rate of inflation was expected to be lower at that time.\n\nIn return for House acceptance of this change, the Senate's conferees agreed to raise the the total amount available for food stamps to $11.7 billion, from a $10.87 billion limit imposed in a separate Senate measure on food stamps.\n\nThe conference, now in its third difficult week, broke another deadlock by accepting a watered-down Senate version of a farm bill clause intended to tighten inspection standards on imported meat.\n\nThe conferees did this despite warnings from the House Agriculture Committee chairman, E. (Kika) de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, that this version was not present in the meat inspection clauses of either the House- or Senate-approved farm bills. He said that this would subject the conference report to a floor challenge when it is returned for final approval by both bodies. Floor Challenge Promised\n\nRepresentative Glenn English, Democrat of Oklahoma, whose more stringent meat inspection clause was rejected, said afterward that he would probably challenge any conference bill that included the clause adopted today.\n\n''I intend, as of now, to work against the conference report we now have,'' he said. ''It's not in any way what the farmers of this country want.''\n\nIn the original food stamp section of the House farm bill adopted last month, the date for adjusting food stamp benefits for inflation was to be June 30, 1982, with whatever changes this required to be paid after Oct. 1.\n\nThe conferees today accepted a motion by Representative E. Thomas Coleman, Republican of Missouri, to make the adjustment on April 30, 1982, when presumably the inflation rise would not be as high as later in the year and thus the increase in food stamp benefits would not be as great. The April 30 adjustment, which also would not actually be paid until after Oct. 1, was expected to reduce food stamp costs by about $700 million. This saving would be effective in the fiscal year starting next October.\n\nBy raising the spending limit on food stamps in this fiscal year to $11.7 billion, the conferees intended to insure the same rate of benefits through Sept. 30 even though rising unemployment was expected to increase the number of families on the food stamp rolls.\n\nIf the cap had not been raised, as these numbers increased, the levels of benefits would have had to be reduced. The rescheduling of the adjustment date was done in the absence of Representative Frederick W. Richmond, Democrat of Brooklyn, who has been the chief architect of food stamp legislation in the House. However, Mr. Coleman said the change had been approved last night by Mr. Richmond.\n\nThe question of new meat inspection requirements has been bedeviling the conferees for more than a week. Opponents of both the English measure and the one originally introduced in the Senate by Senator John Melcher, Democrat of Montana, charged that they would result in blocking most meat imports into this country.\n\nBoth measures would have banned any foreign meat or meat products from animals treated with chemicals that are banned for use in the United States.",

In response to Smith\u2019s account the airline will only say it was a mechanical issue.

It\u2019s 3,200 miles west of California in the dead center of the vast Pacific.\n\nToday, Midway acts as emergency diversion point for transpacific flights. It has been used before, but rarely, as a place where planes go when they have a problem over the Pacific Ocean and can\u2019t make it back to Hawaii.\n\nSmith said the passengers were each given a $500 voucher for their troubles. Many were still waiting earlier today for their flight to Guam.",

She was a demon. We had to destroy her.\"\n\nThe group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult.\n\nMs Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate.\n\nThe public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse.\n\nThe only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie.\n\nNo-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.\n\nSince the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",

He is a handful for defenders to mark.\n\nMarouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United.\n\n'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option.\n\n'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.'\n\nFellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.\n\nWayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment.\n\nFellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nNow the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier.\n\n'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney.\n\n'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him.\n\n'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch.\n\n'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were.\n\n'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him.\n\n'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.'\n\nFellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby.\n\nUnited are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope.\n\n'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney.\n\n'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in.\n\n'We have been working really hard.\n\n'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.'\n\n'We are confident going to Chelsea.\n\n'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea.\n\nLouis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth.\n\n'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can.\n\n'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue.\n\n'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

That raises the prospect of a return to all-out war. At the moment, the purported terrorist activities that Putin has vowed to put down are very much in dispute. The region is awash with military personnel and hardware from both nations, as well as the two rebel armies based around the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nRussia says that Ukraine deployed agents to destabilize the Black Sea peninsula and that two Russian servicemen were killed in shootouts. Ukraine denies the accusations and says Russia may be fabricating them as a pretext for military action. The lack of witnesses and the absence of media on the scene make it hard to corroborate such claims.\n\nCrimea remains under Russian control, though only seven other countries officially recognize Russia\u2019s claim. The U.S. and the European Union say they\u2019ll maintain sanctions until Russia returns the territory to Ukraine, which is highly unlikely. A peace accord signed in February 2015 stemmed the worst of the fighting, but regular clashes between the army and insurgents have resulted in a growing number of deaths. Ukraine\u2019s military said July was its deadliest month in almost a year.\n\nDiplomacy continues in the form of regular meetings and telephone conversations among Ukrainian, Russian, German and French officials -- the so-called Normandy format. Envoys also gather frequently in Minsk. Progress, however -- such as the release of Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko -- has been scant. Russia has also pulled back its initial support for another four-way meeting during next month\u2019s Group of 20 meeting in China.\n\nThe peace accord signed last year in the Belarusian capital of Minsk halted heavy fighting and set out a path to reconciliation, but little has been achieved since. Weaponry initially pulled back has been returned to the battlefield, a full prisoner exchange hasn\u2019t taken place and the two sides are at loggerheads over elections and the constitutional status of the rebel-held lands. The United Nations says the death toll is nearing 10,000.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of explanations. Russia says Ukraine wants to destroy key Crimean infrastructure and distract its citizens from its own economic travails. Ukraine says Russia is fabricating a reason to attack it. Outside the official barbs, analysts list several possible scenarios: Putin may be seeking to show Crimeans how important Russia is to their well-being before parliamentary elections in September, or trying to achieve relief from sanctions by showing that Ukraine isn\u2019t committed to the peace process.\n\nRussia says the deaths of its servicemen won\u2019t go without a response. Putin, who\u2019s already enacted a host of economic penalties against Ukraine, has spoken of enhanced security measures. While the U.S. and the EU have urged calm heads, reports suggest that Russia is bolstering its military presence on its neighbor\u2019s border. It\u2019s already been conducting drills nearby. Ukraine has put its military on high alert. Investors are worried, pushing Ukrainian bond yields to a six-month high after the spat began.",

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",

It has convinced the country that El Salvador is not a five-cent cigar, but it is no longer talking as if the crisis in Central America were a threat to world peace.\n\nThere are some other signs of common sense. President Reagan made a superb conciliatory speech to the Parliament in Ottawa and will meet again with President Lopez Portillo of Mexico next month.\n\nHe is also resisting the pressure of the protectionists to impose restrictions on the import of Japanese cars -though this is a savage and divisive controversy - and he has put Vice President Bush in charge of preparing for what promises to be an important conference with the other leaders of the industrial nations in Canada next July.\n\nNothing surprises Washington more than a new President who is faithful to his campaign promises, and Reagan has done better on this than most of his recent predecessors. But he has taken the rising opposition to his Economic Recovery Program seriously, and is trying to avoid unnecessary conflict with the Democrats, much to the despair of some of his more unyielding supporters.\n\nFor example, some of his old penthouse buddies in California have been raising tax deductible funds to propagandize his economic program and telling prospective contributors that ''the President wants this and the President wants that.'' Also, that the names of such contributors would not be published.\n\nThis has irritated Robert Byrd, the Senate Minority Leader, among other influential Democrats, and the White House, through Chief of Staff James Baker, has told the leaders of this private Republican fund-raising organization to keep the President's name out of their solicitations and remember that he favors disclosure of the names of contributors.\n\nIt is in the field of foreign affairs, however, where there is a noticable change of emphasis. Secretary of State Haig is no longer saying that the Soviets must accept a civilized ''code of internatinoal conduct'' before talking with them about the control of nuclear weapons, world trade, the Middle East and other critical problems.\n\nHe does not concede that he is changing his tone on El Salvador, Afghanistan, Poland or anything else, but he is now talking publicly about talking to the Soviets, provided they don't make things worse by using force in Poland, and even if they don't withdraw from Afghanistan.\n\nHaig is under considerable pressure not to enhance the range and fighting power of the 62 F-15 planes sold by the Carter Administration to Saudi Arabia, but he is sticking to this deal, despite the opposition of Israel and influential Jewish leaders in this country.\n\nIn fact, with the approval of the President and the Pentagon, Haig is pressing for more rapid construction, at increased cost, of military facilities from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean.\n\nThese would include the improvement, at a cost of over $100 million, of a base at the Egyptian port of Ras Banas across the narrow Red Sea from a major oil terminal in Saudi Arabia; also the construction of a former British base on the island of Masira off the coast of Oman; and other improved military facilities in Oman, Somalia, Kenya, and the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThese would not provide the permanent ''on the ground'' bases for U.S. troops Haig is understood to prefer, but they would be available to the Navy and the Rapid Deployment Force if the nations concerned agreed later for their emergency use.\n\nAll this, however, will take years to complete, and the Administration is not emphasizing the program. It is merely trying to make clear to the Soviets that it intends to defend its vital interests in the oilfields, by force if necessary, but it does not want the Soviets to have grounds for believing that this is a policy of ''encirclement.''\n\nNevertheless, the allies have been counseling caution, and urging Haig to cool the anti-Soviet rhetoric. Britain is pre-occupied with its economy, and the French with this summer's election, but their fear is that the anti-Soviet thrust of the Reagan Administration might persuade the Soviets that no reconciliation between East and West is possible and, therefore, that Moscow should concentrate on the defense of its borders, by sticking in Afghanistan and taking over Poland if necessary.\n\nNo doubt the recent visits here of French, British and German officials have contributed to the more moderate and balanced statements by the Administration in recent days. The allies have mixed feelings about the Reagan budget, approving stronger defenses, yet fearing that Reagan has mainly transferred money from social programs to the Pentagon and not really dealt with his sagging economy, which is the main concern of the industrial nations.\n\nThis is also the theme that worries the Congress. On the whole, the calmer language on foreign affairs is approved on Capitol Hill, for it was diverting attention from the President's recovery program, and both parties now seem to agree that it is the economy that is the ''present danger'' to the security of the nation.",

(AP)\n\nIt\u0092s a tough case to make, comparing New Hampshire and Alaska, the state capitals of which are some 4,000 miles apart. But the Alaska governor and GOP vice-presidential candidate went for it anyway, ticking off the similarities at a pair of rallies in New Hampshire, a battleground state where she and running mate John McCain are trailing in the polls.\n\n\u0093I know that we can count on the good people of New Hampshire because you\u0092re a lot like the people of Alaska,\u0094 she told a crowd in Dover, N.H. \u0093We all love good moose hunting, I know that. And we both so enjoy our great lands, the clean water and the fresh air and the abundant wild life and good fishing, we love being outdoors.\u0094\n\nAnd while statistics on loving \u0093good moose hunting\u0094 are hard to come by, other measures are readily available. Washington Wire scanned the latest Census Bureau data to find a more thorough comparison.\n\nAmong the similarities: roughly the same population growth rate\u20136% each from 2000 to 2006. They are close to one another on similar median incomes, about $53,000 in 2002. The states also share a small number of electoral votes. New Hampshire boasts four, while Alaska has three.\n\nBut the differences are vast. For starters, New Hampshire has less than two-one-thousandths the amount of land as Alaska, but nearly twice as many people. Population density disparity is stark: Alaska has one person for every square mile, New Hampshire has 137.\n\nAlaska\u0092s population is much more diverse, while New Hampshire is older. Only 71% of the Alaska population is classified as white, compared with nearly 96% for New Hampshire. New Hampshire has twice the percentage of people 65 and older.\n\nThere is significant spread on residents with health insurance as well. From 2005-2007, an average of 10% of New Hampshire residents were uninsured each year. In Alaska, the number was 17%.\n\nNew Hampshire and Alaska are also far apart economically. Wholesale trade sales topped $13.2 billion for New Hampshire in 2002, compared with just $3.6 billion for Alaska. One out of 10 Alaskans lives below the poverty line. In New Hampshire, it\u0092s one out of every 15. Retail sales per capita in 2002 averaged $16,330 in New Hampshire, roughly $5,000 more than that of Alaska.\n\nMedian home values in both states are above the national average. But Alaska\u0092s median price is higher \u2013$144,200 compared with New Hampshire\u2019s $133,300.",

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

Writing the 'Love Boat' theme and playing Little Enos in the 'Smokey and the Bandit' movies,\" he said.\n\n\"I must have done three 'Love Boats,' and three or four 'Fantasy Islands,' and it was very heady. I became better at showing off than showing up,\" he said. \"You know you're an alcoholic when you misplace things like a decade.\n\n\"The best description of my career and my alcoholism is that in the '70s, I was nominated for six Academy Awards and actually won one. Then, in the '80s, I wrote the music for 'Ishtar.' \"\n\nIt's been an uphill climb since then. \"When I got sober in '89 and really looked at my life, I found that because I'd been medicating so long, I had denied myself the chance to really experience life,\" he said.\n\nActing, singing and writing music seemed impossible. \"I didn't know if I could do any of these things again. I was terrified. All I wanted to do was stay in rehab.\"\n\nWilliams went to UCLA and got himself certified as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation counselor and worked as a volunteer. \"I didn't know whether I would ever act or write songs again,\" he said.\n\nHe tried. In '92 he wrote the songs for \"A Muppet Christmas Carol.\" \"I was proud of the work, but the passion was not there,\" he said. \"So the deal was, I would write music again when I fell in love with it,\" he said.\n\nAbout two years ago, the love came back and he established his second home on Nashville's Music Row. His latest effort, \"You're Gone,\" co-written with Jon Vezner, is the title track on Diamond Rio's new album.\n\nWilliams is married to his first-ever blind date, Hilda Keenan Wynn (of the famous acting family), and has two children from a previous marriage. \"My son, Cole, is 17 and wants to be an actor. My daughter, Sarah, graduated from middle school yesterday and wants to be Mrs. Matt Damon,\" he said.\n\n\"The cartoon acting I did in so many of the films, well, I'm going to have to live with that. But I look at some of my sober acting and I see a difference.\n\n\"It's weird, because I've got the star on Hollywood Boulevard and the Oscar on my piano, but it's almost as if they belong to somebody else. I get the credit, but I also get to be the new kid in town.\"\n\nThese days, he said, \"My compass is working a little better. I hit my knees every morning and say, 'Use me as a tool today.'

(The Associated Press)\n\nAbbott and Costello's heirs are crying foul after a Broadway play used a satanic sock puppet to perform part of the comedians' famed \"Who's on First?\" baseball routine.\n\nThe copyright holders sued \"Hand to God\" producers, promoters and playwright Robert Askins on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, demanding unspecified damages as they accused them of copyright infringement.\n\n\"Hand to God\" will be up for five Tony Awards, including best play, on Sunday. It opened in early April to flattering reviews after previews that began in mid-March.\n\nThe play's lead producer, Kevin McCollum, said in an email that the filing of the lawsuit on the eve of the Tony Awards was \"obviously nothing more than a stunt, and, frankly, we welcome the attention.\"\n\nClick here to subscribe to FOX411\u2019s YouTube channel\n\nThe production's spokesman, Rick Miramontez, added: \"The lawsuit is baseless; the material in question is in the public domain, and the show's producer carefully vetted with the production's legal counsel.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims the play \"copied the very heart\" of \"Who's on First?\" with a 1-minute, 7-second portion that was used so the play could more easily be promoted as a comedy as it confronts dark sides of human behavior.\n\nIt said the scene taking place 15 minutes into the production is \"one of the lighter moments of the production, without which the much darker tone of the rest of the play would be very difficult for the audience to handle.\"\n\nNothing new, different or transformative happens during the \"Who's on First?\" segment of the play, the lawsuit said. Sometimes, courts have tossed out copyright lawsuits when it can be shown that copyrighted material was used in a new and transformative way.\n\nThe comedy duo Abbott and Costello first performed \"Who's on First?\" in March 1938 with Lou Costello trying to learn the names of players on a baseball team from William \"Bud\" Abbott. Laughs ensue when Costello was left perplexed as he grappled with the reality that the first baseman was named \"Who,\" the second baseman, \"What,\" and the third baseman, \"I Don't Know.\"\n\nCostello's daughter, Chris Costello, told The New York Post for its Friday editions: \"The legacy of my father is important to me and my family, and we felt that this lawsuit was necessary to protect us.\"",

Investigators reportedly claim DNA evidence links\u00a0Ghlam to her murder.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nSid Ahmed Ghlam (pictured)\u00a0had shot himself in the leg before his arrest by anti-terrorist officers.\n\nKilled: DNA evidence also reportedly links Ghlam to the murder of Aurelie Chatelain (pictured left and right), a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor who shot dead in her car in a Paris suburb on Sunday morning.\n\nGathered: This is the student residence  where Sid Ahmed Ghlam - a 24-year-old computer science student suspected of plotting imminent attacks on churches in France - had reportedly been living.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve today said: 'A terrorist attack was foiled on Sunday morning.'\n\n'The police discovered an arsenal containing weapons of war, and a suspect was immediately taken into custody.'\n\nVictim: DNA tests reportedly link the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain (pictured) on Sunday.\n\nMr Cazeneuve said the suspect was found on a street in the 13th arrondissement of Paris with a bullet in his leg, and bleeding heavily.\n\nHe originally claimed to be the victim of an attack by criminals, but officers followed the trail of blood to his car, where they found a Kalashnikov assaultrifle, and a Sig-Sauer automatic pistol.\n\nThere were also stolen police armbands which would enable him to pose as a plain clothes officer.\n\nIn Ghlam's student accommodation, detectives later found three automatic rifles, handguns, and bulletproof vests.\n\nThere were also Jihadi flags and literature, false passports, and plans for attacks on 'one or two' churches in the Paris area.\n\nDNA analysis reportedly linked the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain, who was originally from Caudry, in northern France.\n\nThe arrested man was an Algerian national studying computer science in Paris,\u00a0and was known to the intelligence services.\n\nThe man had been considered a likely candidate to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State terrorist organisation, said Mr Cazeneuve,\u00a0and was officially under surveillance.\n\nTragic: Ghalm's arrest came just hours after the murder of Aurelie Chatelain (pictured), a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, who was riddled with bullets as she sat in her car in the Paris suburb of Villejuif.\n\nStatement: French Prime Minister Manuel Vall, left, and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, speaking to the assembled media about the thwarted attack after a cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris today.\n\nLocation: The 24-year-old, named locally as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, had shot himself in the leg before his arrest by anti-terrorist officers in the 13th arrondissement in southern Paris (pictured) on Sunday morning.\n\nThe arrested man had moved to France in 2009, and was supported by his sister, who lives in the Paris area. Her home has since been raided by police too.\n\nIt follows the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in January, when three Islamist terrorists slaughtered 17 people in the city.\n\nThey included cartoonists and journalists working for the notoriously anti-Muslim magazine, as well as police and four Jews who were targeted in a kosher supermarket.\n\nTwo of the attackers, Saif and Cherif Kouachi, were both from Algerian backgrounds, while the third, Amedy\u00a0Coulibaly, was from a Malian immigrant background.\n\nAll were shot dead by police commandos following sieges.",

Image Credit: MicroCHIPS, Inc.\n\nA microchip could one day change the way many of the 10 million Americans living with osteoporosis manage their symptoms.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges of treating osteoporosis by injection is remembering to take the medicine. But a new experimental implantable microchip that releases medication makes it possible to set it and forget it.\n\nIn a first of its kind study, Massachusetts researchers implanted the experimental microchip in the waistline of seven women with osteoporosis. The chip released precise dosages of the osteoporosis drug teriparatide, commonly known as Forteo, either prescheduled or triggered remotely by radio communication.\n\n\u201cIt enables telemedicine, in which physicians can keep track of their patients and modify as needed,\u201d said Robert Farra, president and chief operating officer at Michochips Inc. in Waltham, Mass., which makes the experimental microchip and funded the study.\n\nThe daily injections increased bone formation in all seven women, according to the study published Thursday in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nThe chip, equivalent to the size of a computer flash drive, remained in place for four months. The women didn\u2019t even feel the chip and they experienced no side effects, according to the researchers.\n\nThe women were auto-injected with the medication daily for up to 20 days.\n\nAccording to Dr. Robert Neer, an endocrinologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-investigator, treatments fail and diseases worsen simply because patients forget to take their pills, or can\u2019t face painful daily injections.\n\n\u201cIt [the microchip] makes sure that a patient gets every dose that is expected, because the chip is more reliable than the patient,\u201d said Neer.\n\nThe microchip follows suit with many other implantable medical devices, such as pacemakers, joint replacements and fluid pumps.\n\nThese women may have been given more consistent doses compared to standard self-delivered injections, according to the study. However, the study did not compare the participants\u2019 doses and quality of life to those who use standard injections.\n\nAlthough this preliminary study tested the microchip device on only seven women, the researchers said it sets up more efficient ways for patients to self-administer their own medication, and even for doctors to better monitor their patients\u2019 treatments.\n\nThe microchip is not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Further tests still need to prove it is just as safe and effective in a larger group of people.\n\nBut, said Farra , given where the technology seems to be headed, a doctor could administer a patient\u2019s medication remotely \u2014 perhaps one day from a smartphone.\n\n\u201cWe have the ability to also house sensors inside the microchip. The microchip is capable of both sensing and drug delivery. At some point we envision that we could combine those two in the same device.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 Dr. Sarah Combs contributed to this report.",

He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011.\n\nHe quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens.\n\nBizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader.\n\nOn his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles.\n\nIn one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'.\n\nIn 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims.\n\nMr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that.\n\n'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.'\n\nHe also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud.\n\n'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember\u2026 Personally I didn't find it that shocking.'\n\nMr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left)\n\nAccording to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance.\n\n'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.'\n\nAnother post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil and held in a cellar for.\n\nMr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.'\n\nMs Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for \u00a3249,950 in 2007 in North London.\n\nLast night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks.\n\nA spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011.\n\n'The party does not endorse the views expressed and would not want to be associated with them.

The largest loss, $20.3 million, was posted by North Shore Medical Center in Salem.\n\nMass. General and North Shore Medical are both owned by Boston-based Partners HealthCare System, the state\u2019s largest hospital and physicians network.\n\nOf the state\u2019s 11 unprofitable hospitals, only Cambridge Health Alliance, which lost $6.3 million, is a standalone institution. The rest were affiliated with larger systems \u2014 Partners, Steward Health Care System, and Baystate Health \u2014 that were profitable as a whole.\n\nThe report understates the financial pressures on hospitals, said Tim Gens, executive vice president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association. He cited government reimbursement cuts, a decrease in inpatient volume, and a state push to reduce medical expenses.\n\n\u201cMargins are just one measure,\u201d Gens said. He said that North Adams Regional Hospital, which closed in March, made money in fiscal year 2013. \u201cWhat the margins don\u2019t tell you is the age of the facilities, their debt service, their access to capital, their cash on hand \u2014 all these are examples of the measures you have to pay attention to if you manage hospitals.\u201d\n\nFive profitable hospitals registered non-operating gains, from investments and other activities, that offset operating losses. They were Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, Partners-owned Nantucket Cottage Hospital, Steward-owned Norwood Hospital, and UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester.\n\nThe report showed stark differences in the financial performance of many hospitals, ranging from a 14 percent profit margin at Worcester\u2019s Saint Vincent Hospital to a nearly 23 percent loss at Steward-owned Quincy Medical Center.\n\nFigures for 50 hospitals, those on the standard fiscal year, covered the 12 months ending Sept. 30. But for some hospitals with different fiscal years, the data covered shorter periods. For Steward, which uses a calendar year, the data covered nine months. For Cambridge Health Alliance, three months of data were included.\n\nWhile the Steward hospitals as a whole earned $5.6 million during that period, four of the 10 \u2014 Quincy Medical, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Merrimack Valley in Haverhill, and Morton Hospital in Taunton \u2014 posted losses. Two Partners hospitals lost money \u2014 North Shore and Faulkner Hospital in Jamaica Plain \u2014 but Partners overall earned $292.5 million.\n\nIn addition to Boston Children\u2019s and Mass. General, the biggest money makers were Partners-owned Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, with $139 million; Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, which earned $104.6 million; and, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, with a profit of $100.1 million.",

And cringe-worthy accounts from passengers who had to make do without power or working toilets for five days may have turned some travelers off cruising for good.\n\nBut for those undeterred by the mishap that befell the Carnival Triumph in February, or several other headline-grabbing woes that afflicted some of Carnival Corp.\u2019s other ships over the past year, this is a good time to save money on a cruise vacation, experts say.\n\nAnd it is not just Carnival that has had to discount its fares to coax back passengers. An economic slowdown in Europe has opened the door to savings on cruises that sail around ports in the Mediterranean Sea, says Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor in chief of Cruise Critic, an online cruise reviews guide published by The Independent Traveler Inc. \u2018\u2018A lot of Europe is feeling the pinch of the recession,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018There are some low prices and there\u2019s a lot of availability.\u2019\u2019\n\nHere are eight tips for saving money on a cruise vacation:\n\n1. Book early: The cruise industry touts offer-packed deals during its annual \u2018\u2018Wave Season,\u2019\u2019 which runs from January through March. If you know exactly when you want to travel, say specifically in the summer when kids are out of school, it pays to book as soon as possible.\n\n2. Avoid peak times: High season is generally during the summer and other times of the year when school is out. That includes spring break, around the December holidays, Thanksgiving, etc.\n\n3. Sail old school: Another way to save: Select a cruise with an older ship. It may not have as many amenities, but it won\u2019t have nearly as many of the cabins with balconies, which are pricier than the smaller, windowless interior cabins.\n\n4. Look for repositioning cruises: Cruise lines move their ships from their rotation in one region to another every few months, usually as the high season in one region cools off and before the next destination heats up. Booking a vacation on one of these repositioning cruises can be significantly cheaper than a regular itinerary that hits several stops before returning to a home port. All told, you could pay from $35 to $65 per person, per day on a repositioning cruise, says Spencer Brown.\n\n5. Look beyond price: Perks and incentives could end up making the trip a better value. But a key factor is whether the cruise you select is right for you. Experts recommend you read up about specific ships and their itineraries to get a sense of whether the cruise fits what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n6. Target cheaper itineraries: The shorter the voyage, the less costly the cruise. If you\u2019re looking for ultra-cheap, go for a three-day cruise, which tend to compete more on price.\n\n7. Consider a travel agent: A cruise vacation has a lot of components to sort out, from air travel to the departure port, to offshore activities that often are not included in your cruise costs. Travel agents can help sort out the details.\n\n8. Account for extras: The term all-inclusive is often associated with a cruise vacation, but in most cases, it is far from the truth. Here\u2019s a tool to help add up potential travel costs when you book a cruise: www.independenttraveler.com/travel-budget-calculator.",

The ratings are coming!\n\nAnd if the networks voluntarily adopt their own six-category TV ratings system next month as more and more news reports continue to suggest they will the question then becomes:\n\nIn other words, the way the networks likely will assign these ratings, and the way viewers probably will use them, render them almost meaningless.\n\nThe categories, according to a Washington Post report yesterday, now range from TV-K (suitable for all children) to TV-M (the equivalent of movies' NC-17 rating). In between are TV-K7 (intended for children older than 7), TV-G (all audiences), TV-PG (parental guidance suggested) and TV-14 (suitable for 14 and older).\n\nSix categories may sound like a workable, even a comprehensive, ratings system, but when it comes to placing specific programs in these specific categories, let's not kid ourselves. It won't be easy (even with ratings being applied to series in general, rather than specific shows), it won't catch everything and, more than likely, it won't make much sense.\n\nFirst of all, the categories at both ends of the spectrum are no-brainers.\n\nThere isn't a single program on commercial TV not even those reprehensible blood-and-bruises specials on Fox that would earn a TV-M. That designation would be reserved for the likes of HBO's late-night \"Fetishes\" documentary and \"Real Sex\" series, or the Playboy Channel's raw \"Night Calls\" interactive call-in show.\n\nAs for TV-K programs suitable and designed for all kids programs like PBS' \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" and \"Sesame Street\" come to mind. The problem is, they would come to mind anyway. You don't need a TV-K to find Big Bird, and you don't need a TV-M to know your kids shouldn't be watching a postmidnight premium-cable show about domninatrixes.\n\nAccording to industry officials quoted in The Washington Post, even TV-14 would be reserved for only a few clearly mature programs. The examples cited, \"Millennium\" and \"The X-Files\" on Fox and \"NYPD Blue\" on ABC, carry viewer advisories already. If that's it, then the rest of TV is getting off very, very easy.\n\nTV-K7 would be shows such as \"Wishbone\" and \"Bill Nye, the Science Guy\" targeted at kids, but slightly older ones. Again, parents can recognize and find these shows on their own. TV-G is full-family fare not intended solely for kids.\n\n\"The Wizard of Oz,\" for example, would be TV-G or would it? It contains \"limited violence,\" one of the guidelines that would push Dorothy and Toto into the category of TV-PG. That's the category also housing \"infrequent coarse language\" and \"some suggestive sexual dialogue and situations.\"\n\nIn other words, TV-PG is the place you'd expect to find \"Friends.\" And \"Frasier,\" \"Cybill,\" \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,\" \"ER,\" \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" and \"Melrose Place.\" And, unless they earn some sort of reality-TV exemptions, where you'd also find \"Cops,\" \"Unsolved Mysteries\" and even \"When Animals Attack.\"\n\nDon't let that fact slip by unnoticed. What it means is that, once you take away the obvious programing for kids and the most blatant adults-only cable offerings, what you're left with is a ratings system where the vast majority of programing, especially in prime time, is lumped into the same catchall TV-PG category which is no help at all.\n\nUse a V-chip or simple parental guidance to exclude those programs, and you've wiped away just about everything in prime time. Deal with the TV-PG shows on a case-by-case basis, and you're back where you started making individual decisions about individual programs.\n\nWhich was the right place all along. Caveat viewer: Let the viewers beware. And let the parents decide.",

He was pronounced dead at Marin General Hospital, according to the state Department of Corrections. He had been in San Quentin State Prison for nearly 28 years awaiting an execution date.\n\nRamirez, who scrawled pentagrams on crime scene walls and yelled \"Hail, Satan\" during his trial, was also convicted of numerous attempted murder, sexual assault and burglary counts stemming from a killing spree that swept through San Francisco and Southern California in 1984 and 1985.\n\nHis victims ranged from 6 to 79 years old and were often killed while sleeping, which earned him his nickname.\n\nIn 2009, investigators also linked Ramirez's DNA to the crime scene where 9-year-old Mei \"Linda\" Leung was beaten, raped and stabbed in a hotel in San Francisco's Tenderloin in April 1984, two months before any of Ramirez's previously known murders.\n\nLeung had wandered away from her 8-year-old brother to look for a lost dollar bill. When he found her again, her body was hanging over a pipe in the basement of the apartment building at 756 O'Farrell St., police said.\n\nRamirez lived nearby around that time - either at 373 Ellis St. or 56 Mason St., police said.\n\nRamirez mostly killed in Southern California, and police say he made his deadly mark in San Francisco near the end of his spree.\n\nOn Aug. 17, 1985, Ramirez shot and killed 66-year-old accountant Peter Pan as he slept in his Lake Merced home, then beat and shot his wife, Barbara, police said. She survived and identified Ramirez as her attacker based on sketches from other surviving victims.\n\nWhen investigators also found a pentagram drawn on the wall at the Pan crime scene, San Francisco police became all but convinced that the Pan attacker was Southern California's by-then infamous Night Stalker. Inspectors also soon began to find evidence of connections between the killer and El Sobrante, where Ramirez had a girlfriend at the time.\n\nBut as San Francisco's investigation began to close in on Ramirez, his time ran out in Southern California, where he had returned after the Pan killing. He attacked a couple in Mission Viejo, and one of the victims was able to get a partial license plate, which cemented Ramirez as a suspect.\n\nPolice released his mug shot, and he was soon recognized by a crowd in East Los Angeles while he was trying to steal a car. They chased him, beat him, and held him until police arrived and arrested him.\n\nRamirez's trial dragged on for four years before he was sentenced to die. Executions in California, carried out by lethal injection, have been on hold since 2006 while the prison system appeals legal rulings that the injections were not being carried out properly.\n\nIn 1988, while the trial was still going on, he proposed to a San Rafael freelance magazine editor, Doreen Lioy, who wrote him dozens of letters while he was in prison. The couple were married in a ceremony in 1996 at the prison. Ramirez wore starched prison blues.\n\nRamirez died of natural causes that \"we're suspecting are related to his liver,\" said Lt. Keith Boyd, an assistant coroner with Marin County.\n\nSince California reinstated the death penalty in 1978, 59 of the state's 735 condemned inmates have died from natural causes, including Ramirez. Twenty-two have committed suicide, 13 have been executed in California, one was executed in Missouri and six have died from other causes, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reported.\n\nEllen Huet is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Instead, in the last three years, the Saudis have guided OPEC oil prices up from $12 a barrel to roughly $30 a barrel, helping to fuel our inflationary economy. Recently, the Saudis have threatened to cut back oil production if the U.S. builds up its strategic petroleum reserves as mandated by Congress. Can we allow such blackmail?\n\nThe Saudis claim they require this arms package, increasing the operational capabilities of the F-15's and providing advanced aerial intelligence - Awacs - for protection against external foes. But the Saudis do not have the capability to absorb this package nor the means to counter a Soviet attack without massive, direct assistance from the United States.\n\nRather than provide vital protection to the Saudis, we run the great risk of falling into an Iranian-type trap where our operational capabilities would be compromised. The greatest threat to the Saudis today is their internal instability and the constant threats to the tottering oligarchy. Providing large stocks of American weapons and training Saudi pilots could contribute to the social unrest as it did in the case of Iran. While training manuals for systems such as the F-14 and the Phoenix missile were compromised during the Iranian upheaval, we are now speaking of possibly jeopardizing our most sophisticated combat capabilities.\n\nMany other arguments opposing this sale have been made, emphasizing the Saudis' failure to support American interests: their active work against the Camp David peace process; their boycott of Egypt; their $400-million-a-year financing of terrorism through the P.L.O.; their condemnation of the American rescue attempt in Iran, and their opposition to American military bases on the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nPositive support from the Saudis was implied when the 1978 sale was granted, but it never materialized. Also, under the terms of the first sale, the Carter Administration told the Saudis and Congress that no additional offensive equipment would be sold. The Saudis have now put us in a possibly humiliating position if we abrogate our public commitment, showing the world that an American policy can easily be broken.\n\nEven these arguments pale before the dangers to American security if we place our sophisticated systems and operational capabilities in the hands of an unstable Government in a potentially explosive region. All of us who know what it means to fight for our country must be very concerned about America's placing itself in such danger. IRVIN STEINBERG Natl.

That has left many borrowers unable to refinance maturing mortgages. Even when they can obtain financing, borrowers are often obtaining much less than they need.\n\nLending is based on a percentage of a property's value and prices are off 34.8 percent from their peak in October 2007. Many see the decline reaching 45 percent.\n\nBut banks have been loathe to foreclose on the mortgages and are extending them.\n\n\"They're taking loans that don't have a cash-flow problem, but definitely have a valuation problem, and they're pushing those out to the future,\" Anderson said.\n\nAbout 4.5 percent of bank commercial real estate loans were 30 or more days delinquent in the second quarter, up from 3.6 percent in the first quarter, according to Foresight Analytics. Nonaccrual -- or the percentage of the loan balances that banks believe borrowers will fail to repay -- rose to 2.6 percent in the second quarter from 2 percent the prior quarter.\n\nBanks account for about $1.7 trillion, or half, of U.S. commercial mortgages outstanding. The delinquency rates have been increasing since the second quarter 2007, when they were 1.2 percent, according to Foresight.\n\nYet foreclosed loans as a percentage of nonaccruals has been declining, down to 19.7 percent in the first quarter from over 30 percent three years ago, according to the most recent statistics from Foresight.\n\nThe practice of extending loans has become so prevalent, it has earned its own catch phrases -- \"push-outs,\" \"kicking the can down the road\" and \"a rolling loan gathers no loss.\"\n\nBanks have many reasons not to foreclose.\n\nFirst, it's an expensive processes. Secondly, banks are not in the business of owning real estate. When they sell a property, they face the same distressed market their borrowers would face, leaving them saddled with more losses.",

A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",

His most recent book, \u201cThe Quest: Energy, Security, and the remaking of the Modern World,\u201d is a follow-up to that earlier work.\n\nYergin on Friday delivered the keynote address at the MIT Energy Conference, an annual two-day gathering of industry insiders, academics, and policy makers. In a wide-ranging interview in his Cambridge office Thursday, Yergin tackled a variety of topics, including protecting the power grid from terrorist attacks and natural disasters; the false promise of oil independence; and the impact of cheap natural gas on power markets.\n\nYergin\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Quest: Energy, Security, and the remaking of the Modern World,\u201d is a follow-up to his 1992 Pulitzer Prize-winning book.\n\nThe low cost of natural gas, the result of the North American drilling boom, is driving higher-cost coal and nuclear plants into retirement, Yergin said. But with growing concerns over climate change, nuclear needs to remain part of the mix, he added, requiring the nation to figure out how to make it economical.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing perfectly good nuclear power plants close,\u201d Yergin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-carbon source of electricity, so there is concern about prematurely losing existing nuclear capacity.\u201d\n\nAs the energy mix continues to shift, Yergin said, he expects the United States to rely on Canada for a larger share of its fuel needs. And that will happen, he added, with or without Keystone XL, the controversial pipeline project that would move Canadian oil sands crude into the United States.\n\nHe said that killing the pipeline would have little impact on reducing the use of fossil fuels and the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that they emit. Accelerating climate change has been a key argument against the pipeline.\n\n\u201cThe Canadians, if they don\u2019t ship it through Keystone, it\u2019s going to come by rail,\u201d Yergin said. \u201cThe big winner from not building Keystone is Venezuela, because their heavy oil has the same carbon footprint as the oil sands. [So] Venezuela or Canada, take your pick. Who is your favorite country and who is your neighbor?\u201d\n\nUS oil production is also booming as the controversial drilling technique known as fracking opens new reserves, Yergin noted. But he questioned whether the United States will ever be able to free itself from foreign oil producers \u2014 whether Saudi Arabia or Canada \u2014 since oil prices are set globally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be independent in terms of price,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to be part of the same global market.\u201d\n\nYergin said one of his biggest concerns is the security of the nation\u2019s power grids, which use computer technologies that can leave them open to cyberattacks. Yergin said the American economy is more vulnerable than ever to such threats because of the proliferation of technology and electronic devices across industries and households, which, of course, rely on electricity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so much more dependent on it than we were 20 years ago. You don\u2019t connect to the cloud without a grid,\u201d Yergin said. \u201cUntil something happens, it\u2019s fine. But something will happen. It always does.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission urged a cautious approach to protecting the grid. Commissioner John R. Norris estimated that building walls and fences around 400,000 miles of transmission lines and 55,000 substations would rack up billions of dollars in costs.",

The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing.\n\nUsers can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK.\n\nThere is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\"\n\nHowever, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\".\n\n\"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy.\n\n\"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\".\n\nSue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\".\n\nShe said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\".\n\nJanet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\"\n\n\"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

Microsoft Corp. wants you to use its MSN search engine, and it's got $1 million worth of prizes up for grabs for those who nibble at the offer.\n\nThe company announced the three-month promotion Tuesday, inviting Web searchers to visit MSNSearchandWin.com to take their chances at winning a prize.\n\n\"We're hopeful that once people give it shot, they'll want to come back again and again,\" said Lisa Gurry, director of marketing at MSN Search.\n\nThe incentive program is another example of how important search engines -- and the advertising dollars they generate -- have become to the Internet economy. It also points to the measures some will take to beat search engine powerhouse Google Inc.\n\nYahoo Inc. recently polled its users to see if offers such as a discount on frequent-flier miles or a subscription to online DVD rental service Netflix would tempt them into switching to its search engine.\n\nAccording to Nielsen-NetRatings, MSN's search engine ranks third, trailing Google and Yahoo. In December, MSN had 10.9 percent of Web searches, down from 14 percent in December 2004.\n\nKen Cassar, senior director of analytics for Nielsen-NetRatings, called MSN's move a \"smart promotion,\" adding that he has tried each of the major search engines and isn't convinced that he could differentiate the results of one from another.\n\nDigital marketing firm WebSideStory Inc. also has found that MSN Search has lost traction over the past year. \"MSN's problem is that when people think of 'search,' they think of Google,\" Erik Bratt, the firm's spokesman, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nThis isn't the first time a company has handed out prizes or other incentives to attract Web searchers. Amazon.com, for example, already offers discounts to people who use its A9 search engine.\n\nFor one Google-partnered site, called Blingo.com, giving away prizes to Web search users is the entire business model. Blingo receives revenue from Google for referring Web search users to its results; the company takes some of that revenue and dispenses prizes to users who access Google via the site.\n\nBlingo chief executive Frank Anderson said his site has tens of thousands of users. \"It's the same business as Google has; we're just using incentives to get people to use our site,\" he said.\n\nLaurel resident Laura Dalrymple won an iPod through Blingo in October and, in return, the company has won her loyalty -- even with Microsoft's incentive program out there.\n\n\"I don't think it's very likely that I'd switch,\" she said.",

She was a demon.

But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse.\n\nThe only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie.\n\nNo-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.\n\nSince the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",

Read on.\n\nProfile: Boris Johnson\n\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\n\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\n\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\n\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\n\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\n\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\n\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\n\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\n\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\n\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\n\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\n\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\n\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\n\nNo, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on.\n\nWhen Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\"\n\nNo, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump. Same hair though.\n\nNo, that's Julian Assange.",

It is a crime against humanity,\" added the prime minister.\n\nUkraine's state security service has accused Russian intelligence officers operating in Ukraine, and the separatist leader in Slavyansk, of involvement in the torture and murder of a local councillor from Yatseniuk's Batkivshchyna (fatherland) party.\n\nHe said Kiev was still waiting for a response to an official request for details of Russian military exercises on the border. It made the request through Europe's OSCE security body and set a deadline of Saturday.\n\nYatseniuk said: \"If the United States, the European Union and the entire international community continues to be united and act together to compel Russia to fulfil its obligations, then we will maintain the peace, stability and international security system that Russia wants to destroy.\"",

Williams, famous for howling \"Are you ready for some football?\" saw his visage and song yanked from ESPN's Monday Night Football opener.\n\nThe country star released a statement to media outlets suggesting he was misunderstood during comments he made on Fox News in which he criticized Obama's golf game with House Speaker John Boehner:\n\n\"Some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood. My analogy was extreme -- but it was to make a point. I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me -- how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites and it made no sense. They don't see eye-to-eye and never will. I have always respected the office of the President. Every time the media brings up the tea party it's painted as racist and extremists -- but there's never a backlash -- no outrage to those comparisons... Working class people are hurting -- and it doesn't seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job -- it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change.\"\n\nQuick rewind for those of you just catching up: Williams was a Monday morning guest on Fox News (video below) to discuss his take on the Republican field of presidential candidates. Seemingly out of nowhere, Williams brought up the golf game.\n\n\"You remember the golf game they had? That was one of the biggest political mistakes ever. That turned a lot of people off ... it just didn't go over.\"\n\nThen he adds, \"C'mon! It'd be like Hitler playing golf with [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. OK? Not hardly?\"\n\n\"They're the enemy,\" he says. When asked who he means by \"they\" he shouts \"Obama!\" and adds Vice President Joe Biden in the mix, referring to them as being two of the \"Three Stooges.\"\n\nThe Fox crew gives Williams the opportunity to clarify himself -- again and again. Anchor Gretchen Carlson later said to him: \"You used the name of one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe, I think, the president.\"\n\nWilliams does not back down. \"Well, that is true. But I'm telling you like it is.\"\n\nESPN's statement on the matter did not make clear whether Williams will be restored to MNF glory. \u201cWhile Hank Williams, Jr. is not an ESPN employee, we recognize that he is closely linked to our company through the open to Monday Night Football.

There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story of simply getting the show on the air. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMTM\u00e2\u0080\u009d broke ground with its focus on the social and work life of a single career woman. The series began in 1970 as 30-year-old Mary relocated to Minneapolis after being jilted by her fiance. The producers originally wanted her to be divorced, but network research showed that viewers wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tolerate that storyline.\n\nThe first quarter of the book takes us through launching the pilot episode, in which Mary is interviewed for an associate producer job by curmudgeonly Lou Grant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got spunk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he famously told her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hate spunk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Confession: Not long after grad school, I worked at \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour\u00e2\u0080\u009d in New York.

Early reviews called the show \u00e2\u0080\u009ca disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the smart, character-driven humor won over the nation, and the same media outlet that initially called Mary \u00e2\u0080\u009cunmarried and getting a little desperate about it\u00e2\u0080\u009d described her a few years later as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthirty-three, unmarried, and unworried \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mary is the liberated woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement of the late 1960s opened the door for female characters.

DANIELS\n\nAs they usually do in June, tenant groups and landlords are once again arguing about the effect of the city and state's rent stabilization laws. But this year there is a difference: next Tuesday New York State's Emergency Tenant Protection Act is due to expire.\n\nThe State Legislature is only now beginning serious negotiations on five proposals to revise the seven-year-old law, which applies to 900,000 rentstabilized apartments in New York City and 75,000 more in Nassau, Rockland and Westchester Counties.\n\nAbout 300,000 other apartments in the city's rent control program and 60,000 more in the state program are not under the jurisdiction of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act.\n\nThe preliminary rounds of the debate were played out in hearings held in the metropolitan area by the Assembly's Standing Committee on Housing.\n\nTenants groups and their allies contended that the law had not protected renters from avaricious landlords and should be amended to offer tenants more protection. Landlord groups and their allies asserted that the law must be changed because it had made it difficult for owners to maintain their properties. Legislature Is Divided\n\nBut working against the kind of broad revision hoped for by both tenant and landlord advocates is a sharp division in the Legislature. While there is strong sentiment in the Democraticcontrolled Assembly for strengthening the bill's protections for tenants, there is opposition to such action in the Republicandominated Senate.\n\nThat division, coupled with the approaching deadline, may result in the Legislature renewing the act largely as is, according to lobbyists for both sides. The Legislature did this in 1977, when the act last came up for renewal.\n\nPeter Beitchman, an aide to Alexander B. Grannis - a Democrat-Liberal of Manhattan who is chairman of the State Assembly's Standing Committee on Housing - said yesterday that he was confident the act would be renewed by the June 30 deadline.\n\nFrank Rinaldi, counsel to the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, said that ''we in the Senate would like to see a return to the free market system,'' but he added that there was not even a slim possibility of that this year.\n\nThe five proposals are by the Rent Stabilization Association, a New York City landlord group that finances the city's rent stabilization system; the Temporary State Commission on Rental Housing, impaneled two years ago to investigate rental housing in the state and since disbanded; Assemblyman John C. Dearie, Democrat of the Bronx and a candidate for City Comptroller, along with another sponsor, State Senator John E. Flynn, Democrat of Yonkers and the Bronx; the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, a tenant lobbying group; and Assemblyman Grannis.\n\nThe proposal of the landlord group incorporates many of the provisions of the present act. But it would limit the act's jurisdiction to New York City alone and would allow landlords to charge market-level rents on vacant apartments, something they cannot now do.\n\nThe four other proposals, in varying degrees, urge greater protection of tenants against rental overcharges and an expansion of the act's jurisdiction. Both Sides Seek Change\n\nThe State Legislature initially voted the act in an effort to protect tenants against excessive rent increases while allowing landlords a fair profit. Since then both tenants and landlords have assailed it.\n\nBehind the jockeying in the State Capitol is the major question affecting millions of apartment renters, a far smaller number of landlords and the quality of housing in some of the state's bigger municipalities: How much rent should tenants pay?\n\nMany issues are involved in the answer. To identify a few: Are the rent increases levied by the Rent Guidelines Board justified by the landlords's economic needs of landlords? How widespread is overcharging for rent-stabilized apartments in New York City, and does it occur in part because the system's enforcement agency has too great a backlog to investigate complaints promptly? Should landlords be allowed to pass along to tenants the higher costs of refinancing mortgages?\n\nIn New York City the rent stabilization law applies to the following: all rental apartment buildings of six units or more; all rental apartments except those covered by rent control; rental apartments in buildings constructed after Jan. 1, 1974 and that have not received tax abatements; and rent-controlled apartments that have been vacated.\n\nIn addition to the basic rent for an apartment, the law governs the sum a landlord can add to the rent for major capital improvements, new equipment, furnishings and fuel costs.\n\nThe nine-member Rent Guidelines Board sets rent levels, and a nine-member Conciliation and Appeals Board adjudicates disputes. The appeals board, by law, gets its funds to operate from the Rent Stabilization Association, to which the owners of rent-stabilized apartments must belong. The association collects about $4 million in dues and contributes about $2.5 million to the appeals board.",

One reason for Amazon\u2019s change of heart is its decision to build more regional distribution centers to speed deliveries of its goods.

The networks\u2019 take from the upfront could be flat or slightly down on last year. More TV ad dollars are expected to migrate to cable channels. But both broadcast and cable are starting to face a broader challenge from online media.\n\nGlobal markets have had a positive reaction to the latest deal to avoid a financial crisis in Europe. US stock futures rose this morning after a strong close for Wall Street on Friday. A new agreement means Cyprus gets a $13 billion bailout and avoids a banking collapse. But in return Cyprus must roll back its bloated and lightly regulated banking system, which has been a haven for Russian billionaires and others seeking to avoid taxes. Steep losses are imposed by this deal on depositors who have more than $128,000 in two large Cypriot banks. Because the banking sector accounts for about half of the economy, the bailout could lead to an outright depression on the island. Further weakness could force the need for another financial rescue for Cyprus in the future.\n\nThere are signs that agricultural subsidies in the US and Europe could be deal-killers for a new trade agreement.

And yes, he always preferred to be called Dr. Buss, because he\u2019d earned that doctorate the hard way in physical chemistry from USC.\n\nBuss was born during the Depression, in Salt Lake City, to parents who soon separated. His mom became a waitress in Evanston, Wyo., and Buss began working at various odd jobs at age 13. He dropped out of high school, toiled on the railroad, then returned to school and threw himself into academics as a means to escape the hard life.\n\n\u201cIn high school I was an overly competitive but underly endowed player,\u201d Buss said of his athletic skills. \u201cI turned to heavy studies, worked hard in the books.\u201d\n\nRELATED: LONGTIME LAKERS OWNER BUSS DEAD AT 80\n\nBuss received an academic scholarship at Wyoming, married young, went on for his doctorate at Southern Cal.

After the closing arguments, Judge Catherine Eagles made the unorthodox decision to extend the service of the four alternate jurors, while the primary panel of 12 deliberated the six felony charges. So for the last five days of deliberations, the gang of four alternates has been required to show up at court each day, sent to a holding room with instructions to avoid talking about the case.\n\nAnytime the jurors are in the courtroom, the judge calls the alternates down to keep them apprised of the status of deliberations. And the alternates are also sent to lunch every afternoon with the rest of the jurors.\n\nSince the alternates were identified last Thursday, it has been impossible to ignore the dynamic between Edwards and one of the female alternates, an attractive young woman with jet-black hair, who seems to have been flirting with Edwards for days.\n\nThe juror clearly instigated the exchanges. She smiles at him. He smiles politely back at her. She giggles. He blushes.\n\nThe jury returns today to resume deliberations for a sixth day. Edwards is accused of using nearly $1 million in campaign donations to hide his affair with his mistress Rielle Hunter. If convicted, he could be sentenced to as much as 30 years in prison and fined as much as $1.5 million.",

While the gruesome assaults have been rare in the West, a rising number of attacks in Colombia has alarmed prosecutors and public health officials and terrified women. Dozens of such attacks, in which assailants soak their victims with sulfuric or nitric acids, are believed to take place here each year.\n\nThe precise reason for the spike here \u2014 and not in, say, neighboring Peru \u2014 is not known. But women\u2019s rights advocates in Colombia talk about an epidemic of violence against women, from spouse-battering cases so extreme that they make the nightly news to reports of illegal armed groups using rape as a weapon in a murky rural conflict.\n\n\u201cSometimes in the West we make fast judgments and say, \u2018Look how terrible they treat women in the East,\u2019 and we don\u2019t look first at ourselves,\u201d said Monica Roa, the Bogota-based international programs director of Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, a rights group. \u201cThe violence here may be different, but it emanates from the same place. This is a culture where machismo reigns, where men do what they want to do.\u201d\n\nIf a woman is attacked over a dowry in India or because she ventured outside without a veil in Pakistan, in Colombia a woman might be attacked because of sheer rage over her independence or even by a disturbed man she doesn\u2019t know.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in 2004 to Maria Cuervo when a complete stranger shouted, \u201cThis is so you don\u2019t think you\u2019re so pretty\u201d and drenched her face with acid.\n\nMostly, though, a jilted boyfriend or a husband intoxicated with jealousy is behind the attack.\n\n\u201cHe had hit me because of jealousy, so I ended it,\u201d Erica Vanessa Vargas, a slight, soft-spoken woman of 20, said of the day she ended her relationship with a boyfriend four years ago. \u201cHe then said, \u2018If you\u2019re not mine, than no one will have you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHer former boyfriend paid a small boy $1.75 to throw acid at her \u2014 changing the course of a young life. \u201cI stopped going to school, I can\u2019t work, I can\u2019t depend on my own self,\u201d said Vargas, wearing a scarf to shield her scarred neck and chin.\n\nThe statistics on acid attacks are hazy in Colombia, as in other countries where they take place.\n\nBogota city councilwoman Olga Rubio, a victims\u2019 advocate, said about 100 of the assaults have taken place so far this year across Colombia. It is a pace that would easily surpass last year\u2019s total of 150.",

I\u2019m talking about Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela. He\u2019s the socialist who knows what he\u2019s doing.\n\nHe pointed it out recently in a State of the Nation address he needn\u2019t have given since everyone who lives in Venezuela already knows the State of the Nation and it is Excruciating.\n\nStill, it seemed to me a commanding reassurance: \u201cI\u2019m a socialist and I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d The Venezuelan treasury is now free to issue notes bearing the motto E Non Sequitur Gloria, or \u201cOut of that which makes no sense shall we stitch the fabric of our glory.\u201d (It\u2019s OK. I\u2019m a Latinist and I know what I\u2019m doing.)\n\nIt works with doctors. They do embarrassing things to embarrassing parts of you inflamed by embarrassing conditions and, if you look uncomfortable, may say with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d\n\nThus did President Maduro, with his own avuncular bedside manner, let his comrades know that he had seen many such ugly inflammations, having created them himself, and that there was no need for embarrassment or concern.\n\nI am reminded of the amorous warning Booth Jonathan gives Marnie on the High Line in the first season of \u201cGirls,\u201d about what he intends to do to her in bed, noting that it might scare her, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a man and I know how to do things.\u201d\n\nSo, what is Maduro doing, other than that?\n\nTo be fair, he is just trying to whip inflation. To that end, he has removed the finance minister from his post after the guy presided over a doubling of consumer prices to 56 percent during his nine-month tenure, which has to be a record. Ted Williams, on his hottest streak, raised inflation by only 48 percent.\n\nWho is the new finance minister? An army brigadier general.\n\nWhat unsuccessful effort at battling inflation did the government try two months ago? Troops.\n\nLook, it seemed to make sense at the time. It\u2019s a syllogism:\n\nWe want to fight inflation\n\nQuod erat demonstrandum. (That\u2019s on the other side of the nation\u2019s 12 million-bolivar note.)\n\nAnd the guy who failed to whip inflation as finance minister \u2014 what is his fate?\n\nA. He has resigned in disgrace from public affairs.\n\nB. He has fled the country in the dead of night, stopping only at Arby\u2019s for an Ultimate Angus (19 million bolivars but that\u2019s with fries).\n\nC. He has dug a hidey hole, only deeper than Saddam\u2019s.\n\nD. He goes back to running the nation\u2019s central bank.\n\nFor Maduro is a socialist, and he knows what he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s why he decreed that company profits can no longer exceed 30 percent. A comfortable operating environment for J.C. Penney, yes, but a solution?\n\nDon\u2019t be so skeptical. Things are under control. As the vice president (whose motto is I\u2019m an oboist and I know when I\u2019m squeaking) explained, \u201cOur fundamental anchor is the dollar at 6.3 bolivars.\u201d Just as the Titanic\u2019s fundamental anchor was a rubber bath toy named Davey.\n\nIt\u2019s a war on inflation, so give war a chance. Bloomberg\u2019s Anatoly Kurmanaev and Corina Pons note that Venezuela\u2019s military men are now in charge of finance, industry, defense, the interior, and air and aquatic transport (hence the anchor). That\u2019s a lot of brains and brawn. Certainly a lot of brawn.\n\nNobody\u2019s saying Mision Cumplida. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done in Venezuela. Inflation is rampant. Goods are scarce. A giant zombie of Hugo Chavez roams the streets squashing cars and giving three-hour speeches. OK, that\u2019s next week.\n\nLife isn\u2019t easy. But Nicolas Maduro is a socialist. And that\u2019s saying something.\n\nWrite to Peter Jeffrey at pjeffrey@bloomberg.net",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 5 sentences.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nLast summer I went on holiday, but I didn\u2019t take a vacation. I continued firefighting and stayed connected to the office in this crazy, 24/7 working world we inhabit. And, I paid a price. I never recharged physically or mentally.\n\nI leave soon for vacation and have been waiting for this departure day with much anticipation. This year will be different. I am resolved to take a vacation\u2026as in unplug, disconnect, chill. And I am encouraging my employees \u2013 \u201cthoroughbreds\u201d all who race until they drop \u2014 to do the same. Vacations are good for my business. Here\u2019s why\u2026\n\n1) Anticipating Departure Increases Productivity: Call it the \u201csuperman\u201d/\u201dsuperwoman\u201d syndrome, but as my departure date looms I find I am possessed with getting things done \u2014 crossing things off my to-do list, tying up loose ends\u2026attending to projects that have suffered sorely from neglect. I switch into overdrive right before a vacation, and my employees do, too.\n\n2) Unplugging Unclutters the Mind: On vacation, after banishing sleep deprivation with solid sleep and hours of gloriously unscheduled time, the cobwebs evaporate and my mental clarity returns. Yes, after a few days away from it all my mind does inevitably return to my business, yet with clarity that often eludes me in the daily rush of meetings, Skype pings, and emails. On vacation I am able to think strategically about my business\u2019s future because I\u2019ve given myself the gift of a peaceful mind. The strategic insights I gain are invaluable and allow me to set new goals and plans for the upcoming period.\n\n3) Downtime \u201cElsewhere\u201d Brings Fresh Perspectives: Visiting faraway places, or even just chilling at a beach somewhere away from it all, makes us see the world differently. Maybe it\u2019s new and different foods, or hearing different languages, or just experiencing life at a different rhythm, but these new perspectives often inspire more flexible thinking and creative problem solving. Often times during my vacations, solutions emerge to issues I might have been tackling for months before my trip.\n\n4) And Back at the \u201cRanch\u201d, the Team Rises to the Occasion: When I am away, or my employees take vacation, the absence creates opportunities for the \u201cLeft Behinds\u201d to stretch and grow professionally, covering new functions and solving different problems.\n\n5) Vacationers Return Rested, Re-charged and Ready to Rock: When I\u2019ve given myself the gift of a real vacation, I return rejuvenated and re-energized and ready to dive in again. The same goes for my team. We are able to buckle down to thinking, creating and problem solving with much greater efficiency.\n\n6) And, Work is Fun (Again\u2026): I know when I return from a vacation I am overflowing with good will and a positive outlook. I\u2019ve got my \u201cspark\u201d back. And the good will and positivism is highly contagious.\n\nI am a fully reformed vacationer with a zealot\u2019s belief in the need for vacations \u2013 Vacations ARE good for business. Happy Travels!",

Gwatkin, a demographer with the Overseas Development Council. It now appears, he said, that this drop is attributable in considerable part to persistently high death rates, not just lower birth rates.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Gwatkin said, the encouraging trends that began after World War II have given way to a ''more confused, ambiguous and diverse'' situation in which further improvements may depend on economic and health advances that will not easily be accomplished. Two Factors Cited as Cause\n\nHe theorized that two factors underlay the faltering mortality picture. First, advances in controlling infectious diseases have had their effect, and the leading causes of death in the poorer countries now are diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, malnutrition and other problems that do not yield easily to modern medical technology. Second, progress in social and economic development has slowed in many places.\n\nMr. Gwatkin's findings on the mortality trends, based on United Nations and other data, are published in the current issue of the Population and Development Review, issued this month but dated December 1980. The journal is published by the Population Council in New York.\n\nAfter World War II, life expectancy began to increase dramatically by as much as two years annually in Mexico and in countries that are now the sovereign nations of Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Jamaica and Taiwan. In that period, the average infant in these countries could expect to die 15 to 30 years before the average American or European. Since then the gap has narrowed considerably.\n\nThough the situation varies from country to country, it is difficult to be optimistic, according to Mr. Gwatkin. Sri Lanka, which was Ceylon until 1972, had made dramatic gains earlier but has suffered an increase in mortality in the late 1960's and early 1970's, as did Bangladesh, which was East Pakistan until 1971. Progress has slowed too in India. The average annual increase in life expectancy in Asia as a whole dropped from 0.7 years in the early 1950's to 0.5 years in the early 1970's. Africa and Latin America\n\nHopes that the gains in life expectancy in Africa, still extremely low, would be the greatest ever have not been fulfilled. In Latin America, the picture is mixed, but the average rate of mortality decline is down there too.\n\nMr. Gwatkin conceded that vital statistics from less developed countries were not consistently reliable. But, he wrote, ''There are too many of them, from too many sources - from independent empirical observations about mortality levels and trends, about disease patterns, about public health measures, about social and economic development relevant to health conditions - simply to be ignored.''",

The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time,  unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.'\n\nWith the same amount of money that the handbag costs, you could splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante.\n\nWhilst they don't own the exact same bag, Kim Kardashian, left, and Heidi Klum, right, are both the proud owners of pink Hermes Birkin bags.\n\nHermes is one of the most coveted handbags of all time, but with a price tag of around \u00a38,000 the Herm\u00e9s Birkin bag isn't quite within every fashionista's price range (unless you're Victoria Beckham whose collection is worth a reported \u00a31.5m).\n\nPrestigious luggage and accessories firm Herm\u00e9s, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as fans, is known for luxury leather accessories.\n\nRenowned for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Herm\u00e8s claims never to use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time, hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product.\n\nThe brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have intriguing stories behind them.\n\nThe iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most popular styles, was originally known as the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935.\n\nIn 1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches to hide her pregnancy.\n\nPhotographs were sent all over the world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since.\n\nVictoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth \u00a31.5m.\n\nThe Birkin has similarly romantic roots, conceived as it was in honour of French star Jane Birkin.\n\nThe Birkin was allegedly created after the company's CEO Jean Louis Dumas sat next to the actress on a Paris to London flight.\n\nBirkin had been discussing her difficulty in finding a leather weekend bag, explaining her ideal.\n\nShortly after, in 1984, the bag she described arrived at her flat with a note from Dumas. Although nowadays the bag can be made to order, the design is still one of the most recognised in the fashion industry.\n\nAnd Victoria Beckham isn't the only celebrity Birkin fan.\n\nBritish-born author Barbara Taylor Bradford owns an impressive 24 and heiress Tamara Ecclestone has specially built cupboards to house her \u00a3100,000 collection.\n\nKatie Holmes, Julia Roberts, Hilary Duff and Kelly Brook are also fans while Jane Birkin, the inspiration behind the roomy leather must-have has said she covers her 'b***** heavy' Birkin with stickers to disguise the fact she's carrying a 'snobbish' bag.",

John Galloway, making his annual appearance at the storied Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.\n\n\"I've been doing this for several years now,\" he said after batting last Sunday for the vacationing senior pastor, the Rev. Tom Tewell, a longtime friend. Galloway, who once was an associate pastor at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, now is the senior pastor of the Wayne (Pa.) Presbyterian Church.\n\n\"I enjoy it enormously,\" Galloway said, \"and I like to think I'm doing Tom a favor.\"\n\nFor sure. All over the city, pastors, priests and rabbis count on stand-ins - either from their own sanctuaries or from out of town - to fill the pulpit while they are away.\n\nBut more and more at larger churches and synagogues, they don't need to look farther than their own ordained aides.\n\nSome pastors, among them the Rev. Anthony Trufant of Emmanuel Baptist Church, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, use guest preachers only on special occasions. During the summer, he calls on his inhouse talent.\n\n\"I've got seven associates champing at the bit,\" Trufant says. \"They like to preach and they're good.\"\n\nThe same is true at famed Marble Collegiate, the Reform Church landmark in midtown Manhattan, where senior pastor Arthur Caliandro - in Maine this week - calls on aides. One is a resident Catholic nun, Sister Carole Perry, who will preach Sept. 2, the last summer speaker.\n\nRabbi Ronald Sobel at Temple Emanu-El, on Fifth Ave., goes with a strict summer rotation among his three associates - officiating today is Rabbi Amy Ehrlich.\n\n\"It's their chance to star, and they're not about to blow it,\" an official said. \"They don't get that many chances to shine, and they spend a lot of time preparing. You hear some great sermons.\"\n\nSermons are not the big deal in Catholic churches, where the liturgical focus is on the Eucharist. But because only a priest can celebrate the Mass, and because of a shortage of priests in many neighborhoods, vacation scheduling can get tricky.\n\n\"In some cases, priests double up on duty or ask friends from other parishes, even from other countries,\" says one Bronx priest, who added that he has been so desperate in past years that he has asked worshipers to help him recruit stand-ins.\n\nPope John Paul, incidentally, does not take a full month, although he does spend his summers at the papal villa in Castelgandolfo, outside Rome. But he spends a lot of it working.\n\n(Actually, he is midway through his real vacation, in a chalet in the Italian Alps, where he has gone for several summers and where he always stays 12 days.)\n\nGuidelines for priests in the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens suggest one month's vacation, which generally is the rule for all faiths.\n\n\"Believe me, pastors need it,\" says Caliandro, who gets 13 Sundays off every year. \"You need the time to think, write, read, rest - just get away from the pressure and demands.\"\n\nEven so, some clergy accept speaking engagements even on their Sundays off - Caliandro just preached in Ludington, Mich., and Tewell spoke in Ocean Grove, N.J.\n\nSometimes, there are unexpected bonuses. Galloway provides one of them.\n\n\"The first time I spoke [at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian],\" he says, \"I realized there was no air conditioning. It was so hot that I gave one of the associate ministers $1 and told him to start an air conditioning fund.\"\n\nEvery year since then, he has handed $1 to every church official at his summer service. \"There were 10 last Sunday, and I gave each of them $1,\" he said.\n\nOne result: Inspired by him, Fifth Avenue began a real air conditioning fund.\n\n\"I'm going to keep coming back,\" Galloway said, \"until I feel comfortable in the pulpit.\"\n\nHe means climatically - he already feels comfortable in every other respect.",

So which super PAC finances certain ads? And which candidate does each super PAC lean towards? Well, there\u2019s an app for that.\n\nThe Super PAC App, soon available for free in the iTunes store, will use audio fingerprinting technology employed by apps like Shazam and SoundHound to identify adverts. Users will be able to hold their iPhones up to an advert while it is playing, and the Super PAC App will draw on third-party data to tell the user which super PAC is running the ad. It will classify the super PAC\u2019s political leaning, and identify the claims the ad is making. The app will then link the user to related articles that could help the user verify the advert\u2019s claim. Users can share the information they find via email, SMS, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBorn out of a class project at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, the Super PAC App is the brain child of recent Harvard Kennedy School grad Jennifer Hollett and MIT Sloan grad Dan Siegel. The pair met and began working on the app in February, and are currently based out of the MIT Beehive Cooperative startup accelerator. The app is set to go live in time for the Republican National Convention at the end of August.\n\n\u201cI have an eternal interest in politics and business and was reading a lot about super PACs,\u201d explained Siegel. \u201cI remember reading an estimate that there would be $11 billion spent in this election \u2013 I remember thinking where is all this money going to? That\u2019s the size of a small stimulus package.\u201d\n\nSince receiving funding from the Knight foundation last month, the startup\u2019s programmer, Bob Caslin, has been hard at work building the app.\n\n\u201cInstead of just sitting there and letting the ads come at you, you have the opportunity to interact with the content,\u201d explained Hollett.\n\nMuch of the third-party data the app sources will come from OpenSecrets.org, a research group that tracks spending in U.S. politics, as well as the New York Times. The app will not just be limited to super pac ads, but will also generate information on non-profit and campaign ads.\n\nHollett and Siegel hope their app will be of most use to voters in the swing states, and the pair seek high download numbers in those regions. \u201cIf we can get 1% or 2% of people in swing states based on the 2010 voting numbers to download the app then we\u2019re looking at hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d explained Siegel.\n\nAccording to data from app researcher Xyologic, there were 378 million iPhone app downloads in the U.S. during April alone \u2013 far more than any other nation in the world. China, the second country in line, downloaded around 246.4 million iPhone apps the same month.\n\nSo is the future\u2019s political landscape full of apps?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll see a lot of digital revolution in this election,\u201d said Hollett. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of how our culture is moving, and how we\u2019re engaging with everything.\u201d\n\nAs for what\u2019s next for the Super Pac App, Hollett and Siegel are undecided. Once the app has served its purpose in the U.S., the duo may take the app and apply it to international elections. Alternatively, they say they could pivot to use the app as a transparency tool, linking users to information that verify the claims made by other commercials.\n\nWould you use the Super PAC App? Let us know in the comments.",

The remaining 800,000 pounds are to be dispensed by the Red Cross, probably sometime next month. Exact details are still being worked out between the Red Cross and the State Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for the program in the state. Rules Seem Imprecise\n\nToday, respresentatives of most of the 100 community groups within the archdiocesan food bank arrived in vans and station wagons to take their shares of cheese from two trailer trucks parked in the shadow of cargo ships. Each truck contained 1,200 30-pound cases of cheese. In each case were six rectangular, five-pound blocks of cheese - packaged as it might appear in cold-cut showcases in a neighborhood delicatessen.\n\nAfter the vans and station wagons were loaded with pre-arranged allocations, they returned to community offices in the four counties of the Newark archdiocese: Hudson, Bergen, Essex and Union. Officials of the community groups will use their own criteria to se l ect recipients.\n\nQualifying rules do not seem precise. When President Reagan announced the program on Dec. 22, he said only that the cheese was earmarked for charitable organizations, needy homes and food banks. It was left up to the states to decide who was eligible.\n\nNew Jersey's Agriculture Department turned to the archdiocese and the Red Cross for help. ''We don't really know who the needy are,'' said Dominick A. Ritardi, coordinator of the food-distribution section in the State Division of Markets. ''We're allowing the Red Cross and food bank to tell us who they are.''\n\nAmong the agencies participating today were a Cuban refugee center in Union City, which got 200 cases; a soup kitchen opened on Sussex Street here last summer by Mother Theresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the Nobel Peace Prize, 60 cases; St. Patrick's Church in Elizabeth, 100 cases; Newark Day Center, 30 cases, and Beulah Baptist Church of Newark, 50 cases.\n\nThe minister at Beulah Baptist, the Rev. J. C. Crawford, was less than sanguine about the Federal Government's largess. ''Man cannot live by cheese alone. Only rats can,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''We certainly need more than cheese. Cheese won't keep the people warm. Cheese won't pay the rent. We need jobs. But when you're poor you have to accept what is given.''\n\nParishioners at Beulah Baptist were told during services on Sunday that free cheese would be available today, Mr. Crawford said. By midafternoon, the only ones who had come for any were four women who had made several calls before locating a site that had the cheese, they said. Mr. Crawford gave each one a five-pound block.\n\nHe said the 296 other blocks he had would go to the poor of his neighborhood and his parish. U.S. Had Stockpiled Cheese\n\nNationwide, all 50 states have expressed an interest in participating in the cheese program, according to Bonnie White, a spokesman for the United States Agriculture Department. Fourteen states, including New Jersey, have already started distributing their portions. Twenty-four others, including New York, have signed agreements with Washington, but have not yet started distribution, Mrs. White said. The remaining 12 states, including Connecticut, are in the process of registering for the program.\n\nIllustrations: photo of women carrying packages of cheese",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 5 sentences.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nIn many ways, we know more about answers to your first question than we do about many things in psychiatry. Because for all the controversy surrounding them, stimulants like Adderall have been the subject of thousands of studies. A number of studies have now followed children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from childhood through adolescence, and the findings are pretty consistent.\n\nThe short answer is that most studies find treatment with medications like Adderall to have good long-term effects on children with ADHD. That is, children with ADHD who receive treatment with Adderall or one of the other psychostimulants do better in multiple areas of their lives than do children with ADHD who don't receive treatment. For example, treatment in childhood is associated with better grades and less substance abuse during the teenage years.\n\nSo that is the overall good news. Here's the bad news: As a group, children with ADHD don't do as well in school and have more behavioral and emotional problems through the years than do children without ADHD regardless of how much treatment they get. Notice, please, that I added the qualifier \"as a group\" to my statement. This is very important, because individual children have very different responses to all manner of treatment, and it turns out this is very important for predicting how they will do over the long haul.\n\nWe can see this in the long-term findings from a large study of ADHD funded by the federal government. This study has now followed hundreds of subjects from childhood into adolescence over an eight-year period. A key finding at eight years is that how children responded when they first got either medication or therapy strongly predicted how well they were doing as teenagers. If a child responded very well to initial treatment, he or she was much more likely to be doing well in their lives as teenagers than children who didn't respond well.\n\nTaken together, this is what I think the science says: ADHD is a serious disorder that has long-term negative consequences on a person's life. In general, treatment provides long-term benefit, but it's not perfect, and most children with ADHD continue to struggle into their teen years, compared with their peers without ADHD. If you can find an intervention -- either medication-based or therapy-based -- that produces significant improvements, this is a strong sign that your child will probably do well over the long term, especially if he or she continues with the treatment. This means that it is very worthwhile to keep searching for a treatment that produces clear improvements in your child, even if this requires trials of several medicines, therapists or both.\n\nYour issue about appetite is a fairly common side effect of psychostimulants. If the medication is working for your child, and if you are seeing clear improvements in his school performance and behavior, then I would encourage you to work with your doctor to find ways to alleviate your child's erratic eating. There are multiple stimulant preparations these days that have different patterns of onset and offset and that might help improve this problem.\n\nNow to your final question. I think the bulk of scientific data indicate that for most children with ADHD, diet alone will not significantly improve symptoms. On the other hand, recent studies suggest that certain dietary interventions may be of some benefit and might be worth considering. Several recent studies found that artificial food coloring additives may increase hyperactivity. Supplements with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may be of some benefit -- in some children.\n\nIn general, current recommendations are that all children -- regardless of whether or not they have ADHD -- eat a balanced diet heavy on fruits and vegetables and low on fatty junk food. If you find that certain dietary measures help your child, and they are not unreasonable from a nutritional point of view, they may well be worth pursuing. But I would not recommend replacing better-proven therapies with diet changes alone.",

In a bathroom of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Athletic Center, the fashion designer Ronaldus Shamask explained to his models how to stand very still. In a back locker room, Issey Miyake's assistant gave his models some last-minute instructions in tai chi. And in an adjoining locker room, Gianfranco Ferre, satisfied with his models, helped Mariuccia Mandelli of Krizia and rolled his eyes.\n\nThe occasion was M.I.T.'s first exhibition of fashion as a serious design discipline, attended by over 1,000 Bostonians and other visitors Friday night, and it was an unprecedented three-ring success. Entitled ''Intimate Architecture: Contemporary Clothing Design,'' the exhibition was mounted at M.I.T.'s Hayden Gallery by the curator Susan Sidlauskas and was followed by a fashion show staged by the Fashion Group of Boston.\n\nBoth presented the work of eight designers who are part of a growing international fraternity informally known as the architects of fashion. All are joined by a similar design vocabulary: a propensity for minimalist designs and cerebral tailoring and an aversion to surface decoration. Although Giorgio Armani and Claude Montana did not show up, the other leading members of the fraternity did: Mr. Ferre, Miss Mandelli, Mr. Shamask, Issey Miyake, Yeohlee Teng and Stephen Manniello, the only American-born designer there.\n\nAlso in attendance was a contingent of New Yorkers including the fashion designers Gloria Sachs, Pinky Wolman and Dianne Beaudry; Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed the clothes for the exhibit's catalogue, and such retailers as Ira Neimark and Dawn Mello of Bergdorf Goodman. In addition, there was a flotilla of fashion followers who came from as far away as Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\n''The exhibit,'' said Mr. Miyake, ''proves that fashion no longer has to be separated from the other design fields. At its best, it is considerably more than a craft. It must represent its time. That M.I.T. has staged this show validates fashion and may inspire students here not to become electrical engineers but engineers of fashion.''\n\nFor the public, the exhibition began at 5 P.M. at the Hayden, and viewers arrived wearing everything from gym shorts to cutaways to pink satin and diamond earrings. Designed by Daniel Pike, the Hayden exhibition shows the clothing without benefit of traditional mannequins. Instead, plaster casts of body parts have been suspended from the ceiling and the clothing draped on them. In the Krizia exhibit, a cast plastic bra and bathing suit bottom hung on a torso. In the Ferre exhibit, a black and white leather Mae West jacket hung serenely next to a Ferre white pique dress, itself a little marvel of fashion engineering. The Miyake exhibit was an explosion of rattan and polyurethane breastplates floating over silk skirts.\n\nFor those who live in Boston, the exhibition was not only an opportunity to wear clothes that might look a little strange on the Boston Common but a signal that fashion had finally arrived in the heart of academia. ''The show,'' said Kate Hines, a jewelry designer in a Daniel Hechter black tuxedo, ''is the most refreshing thing anyone affiliated with fashion will ever see. To have fashion at M.I.T. means those of us involved with it in Boston do not have to have a complex about it.''\n\nSome of the designers who had verbalized misgivings about the show during the fittings at the Athletic Center came away from the Hayden suprisingly sanguine about it all. ''My God,'' said Miss Mandelli, ''my clothing really does look like sculpture.''\n\nAt 9 P.M., the guests left the exhibition to walk under the trees to the Athletic Center, which in the winter houses a hockey rink but which Friday night was filled with tables, a dance floor, black and white balloons and eight platforms placed along the length of one wall. Paper Cape and Monks' Coats\n\nAs the fashion show began, the models came out at intervals. Krizia's woolen coats with hip belts were first, followed by Mr. Miyake's paper cape over a skirt and tunic, and Mr. Shamask's hooded monks' coats. But the lights did not function. The music tape sagged. After some backstage maneuvering, it all fell into place, and as a model wearing a Miyake molded rubber jacket flexed an arm, as Ferre's models wearing his black velvet and leather trousers, tops and ties stepped out, the crowd left the tables, sat cross-legged in their taffeta on the dance floor and applauded.\n\nWhen it was over, each designer, surrounded by his models, was introduced separately to the audience. All that was missing was an applause meter to gauge who had won.\n\nIllustrations: photos of models in latest fashions",

And in an adjoining locker room, Gianfranco Ferre, satisfied with his models, helped Mariuccia Mandelli of Krizia and rolled his eyes.   The occasion was M.I.T.'s first exhibition of fashion as a serious design discipline, attended by over 1,000 Bostonians and other visitors Friday night, and it was an unprecedented three-ring success. Entitled ''Intimate Architecture: Contemporary Clothing Design,'' the exhibition was mounted at M.I.T.'s Hayden Gallery by the curator Susan Sidlauskas and was followed by a fashion show staged by the Fashion Group of Boston."

You can\u2019t understand what being one means unless you\u2019ve been one, which I don\u2019t recommend, but that\u2019s just how the cookie crumbles. One of the topics that has my tech and tax policy brethren going these days, and led to an interesting discussion yesterday at the Republican National Convention, is the idea of an Internet sales tax. State and local governments, especially in this economy, are hungering for more and new revenue streams. One they\u2019ve had their eye on for a while is taxes on sales made over the Internet. Right now, with few exceptions, online purchases made across state lines are sales tax free. Current law isn\u2019t clear as to where sales taxes apply: in the state where the purchaser is or the state where the seller is. Courts have ruled that since there isn\u2019t any clarity or uniformity on where the money is collected, which state\u2019s sales tax applies and, therefore, which state gets the money, sales taxes don\u2019t apply online. As such, states have been pushing for the federal government to clarify these issues so they can get their slice of this ever-growing pie. As a conservative, I\u2019d like to see the Internet remain how it is \u2013 free from government intrusion, taxes and regulation. As a realist, I know that\u2019s simply not going to happen forever. My friend Mike Flynn, a fellow tech policy refugee, wrote this piece agreeing with the concept of \u201cpoint of purchase\u201d sales tax, and I agree. Flynn writes, \u201cIt will be increasingly hard to justify tax-exemption for certain transactions solely on the basis of how that transaction is made. There are enough carve-outs in the tax code as it is. We shouldn't sustain or create new ones to further distort the market.\u201d That\u2019s the fear \u2013 that the federal government will create another monster in the tax code to get a slice of this revenue stream and that it will be in charge of handing it out to the states or, more likely, spending it itself. There are members of Congress who would very much like to tax Internet sales, but that would be disastrous. I\u2019d be all in favor of a national sales tax if, and only if, the Sixteenth Amendment authorizing the income tax is repealed. I don\u2019t want the feds having another bite at the apple. Short of that, the uniformity of a \u201cpoint of purchase\u201d sales tax makes the most sense. It\u2019s there the money is being collected and doesn\u2019t require people to file what I imagine is the least used tax document in the world \u2013 the voluntary and, for all intents and purposes, unenforceable declaration of Internet purchases, whereby taxpayers are encouraged to declare their Internet purchases on the state income taxes and pay their state the sales taxes they would\u2019ve paid had they purchased those goods at their local mall.\n\nTrying to sort out this mess will only lead to more bureaucracy, more cost and higher taxes in the long run, all of which could be avoided through the \u201cpoint of purchase\u201d idea. As an added bonus, it could lead to sales tax competition, whereby states seeking to attract Internet-based companies would compete for their business by lowering their sales tax rate. Businesses would be incentivized to move to low or no sales tax states because to get a leg up on their competitors. States, fearing the loss of those businesses, would be pressured to lower their sales taxes. Consumers could end up being the big winner here. While that\u2019s a possibility, the more immediate and probable course of action would be much worse \u2013 the federal government dipping its considerable fingers into the Internet. And once they\u2019re in, they\u2019re in. Mike Flynn\u2019s \u201cpoint of purchase\u201d proposal not only would keep the federal government camel\u2019s nose out from under the tent, it would keep it tied to a tree away from the tent altogether. At least until the next time, because there\u2019s always a next time when it comes to government and taxes.",

The United States also provides billons annually to Israel in military aid.\n\nMost recently, Trump and fellow Republicans have agreed with Netanyahu that the administration-brokered Iran nuclear deal hurts Israel, Tehran\u2019s enemy, because it lifts economic sanctions without enough safeguards to ensure Iran has indeed curbed efforts to build a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism,\u201d the campaign also said after the meeting. \u201cHe agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.\u201d\n\nThey also said Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been \u201cthe eternal capital of the Jewish People for more than 3,000 years\u201d and that the U.S., with Trump as president, \u201cwill finally accept the long-standing congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel.\u201d",

The woman often uses a wheelchair, according to the resident.\n\nThe government blamed the attack on Somali militants from al-Shabab, and Kenyan navy and police chased the suspected boat at sea.\n\n\"Security forces swung into immediate action and pursued the abductors as they sped northwards in a high-speed boat towards\" Ras Komboni, the town in Somalia the government said the militants originated, according to a government statement.\n\n\"In the ensuing shoot-out between the abductors and the Kenya Navy, several of the abductors were injured but managed to enter\" Ras Komboni, the statement said.\n\nAt one point during the chase two Kenyan boats had the suspected pirate boat surrounded, with four men and the kidnapped woman on board, said Tourism Minister Najib Balala. A plane overhead was also monitoring the situation, he said.\n\n\"We are just concerned about the safety of the lady,\" said Balala. He identified her as Marie Dedieu. French officials said in a statement that she is in her 60s. The Kenyan government called her \"elderly\" and one official said she was in her 70s.\n\nAmbrose Munyasia, a top police official on the coast, said he had information that the French government would join the chase. He said he was optimistic the woman would be rescued soon.\n\nBut by early evening in Kenya there was no news of a successful rescue. In a message to Kenyans, the government said that \"adequate security measures\" had been put into place.\n\nThe French Foreign Ministry said in a statement that French officials are \"working with the Kenyan authorities, who have mobilized significant air and sea resources in order to free our compatriot.\"\n\nOfficials had earlier indicated Somali pirates had pulled off the attack, before the government later blamed al-Shabab. If pirates are involved, it would be the second such attack near the popular tourist town of Lamu in a month. In early September, pirates shot dead a British man and kidnapped his wife from a resort near Lamu.\n\nPeople near the scene of the kidnapping heard gunshots around 3 a.m., Lamu resident Muhidin Athman said. Athman said the Frenchwoman owns a house on Manda Island and lives there half the year. She gets around with the help of a wheelchair or personal assistants, Athman said.\n\nManda Island is just across the channel from Lamu, an old resort town. Two kidnappings within a month have the potential to greatly harm the tourist trade in the area just before the busy holiday season.\n\nAfter the attack, the French Foreign Ministry updated its travel advice for Kenya, \"formally discouraging\" trips to the Lamu archipelago and the surrounding area.\n\nPirates once focused primarily on big ships at sea, but in recent years have also attacked private yachts, capturing Europeans or Americans on private trips.\n\nAs U.S. and European navies have increased their patrols of the Indian Ocean, and as large ships have increased their on-board defenses, pirates may be looking for easier targets to keep ransom payments coming in.\n\nPirates kidnapped and held a British couple -- the Chandlers -- for more than a year.\n\n\"It's profit-motived action. As we know the British couple we captured before paid huge ransoms, so sometimes these targets are a big gain that gives you more than ships,\" a man who identified himself as a pirate commander named Bile Hussein told The Associated Press last week.",

While witness accounts have varied, family members said they were told by police that the driver either backed up or made a U-turn in order to run Jeffrey down.\n\nThe driver fled the scene, and no arrest has been made.\n\nIt is not known if the Tenderloin attack had anything to do with a shooting near Fisherman\u2019s Wharf on Oct. 14 that left Jeffrey with a gunshot wound to his leg. His family said he had been released from a hospital six days before he was hit by the car. That shooting is also under investigation.\n\nJeffrey, who battled alcoholism for much of his life, was homeless and had been receiving care at the Medical Respite and Sobering Center in San Francisco at the time of his death, said his daughter, Angela, who asked to be identified only by her first name.\n\nDespite Jeffrey\u2019s demons, his daughter said he was a well-loved, gregarious man who had graduated from St. Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco and was a devout Catholic.\n\n\u201cHe came from a great family, and he was extremely bright,\u201d said Angela, 35. \u201cWhen he was sober, he was a really good person. He just had a really big personality.\u201d\n\nShe said her father had sought treatment for his addiction off and on through the years, but had a setback in 2012 when he was wounded in another hit-and-run vehicle crash near Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, suffering lasting brain damage.\n\nJeffrey had another adult daughter, as well as many siblings around the country. Angela said she hopes her father\u2019s killer will be brought to justice and that his death won\u2019t be written off because he was homeless.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that because my father was homeless, it will be like it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was homeless, an alcoholic. But his life didn\u2019t mean any less, and I want to make sure his death is investigated.\u201d\n\nPolice are asking anyone with information on either the hit-and-run crash or the Oct. 14 shooting to call (415) 553-0123.\n\nVivian Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Suddenly, someone -- or something -- lurches forward, grabbing you with a decaying hand. A scream erupts from your throat, but then you realize this zombie isn\u2019t part of the apocalypse; it\u2019s just an actor at the local haunted house.\n\nHaunted houses like the House of Shock in New Orleans are getting even more elaborate and more popular. It's a safe thrill, experts say.\n\nEvery Halloween, scores of people watch bloody monster movies or trek through haunted houses all to scream like a little child. What possesses people to seek horror movies and haunted houses?\n\n\u201cIt is a safe way to trigger an arousal response and some people find that pleasurable and enjoyable\u2014and some people find it annoying,\u201d explains Joseph LeDoux, a professor at the Center for Neural Science at the Emotional Brain Institute at New York University.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the haunted house itself, it\u2019s what you experience and what you bring to that and how you can interpret it cognitively.\u201d\n\nHorror movies, often referred to as torture porn, and haunted houses are becoming more and more terrifying. Blackout Haunted House in New York and Los Angeles requires patrons to sign waivers\u2014and everyone walks through the house alone. Patrons receive a safety word that they can shout out if the tour becomes too horrific.\n\nLeDoux studies how the brain processes fear. When a door creaks loudly, the body reacts. The brainstem triggers a startle response, heighted alertness, which could lead to jumping or freezing to protect yourself (you also blink more to shield your eyes).\n\n\u201cThe startle is caused by a sudden stimulus not because it is scary because it is rapid and quite loud,\u201d LeDoux says. Because the brainstem, not a higher functioning part of the brain, controls this, most startle responses are purely reflexive.\n\nThen the amygdala spurs fixed body actions, more complicated movements that enable people to deal with dangerous situations. Finally, your voluntary responses kick in\u2014when you choose to run away or hide from the saw-wielding surgeon.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to put yourself in the situation where the goal is to activate your bodily responses,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd all these responses cause arousal. Basically, watching a horror flick or wandering through a haunted house provides a rush.\n\nFrank Farley, a psychology professor at Temple University, agrees, adding that it is humans\u2019 fascination with macabre that drives people to scare themselves.\n\n\u201cThroughout our history we have been enamored by the dark side,\u201d he says. For some, watching a gory movie or going to a haunted house helps them explore the horrors that occur in life. Zombies remain ubiquitous, Farley suspects, because they embody humans\u2019 fear of death\u2014and the unknown\u2014as well as exploiting the horror of life. The reanimated corpses just continue coming after victims, no matter what happens.\n\nUltimately, wanting to be scared provides an accessible thrill. So few people will jump from a capsule in space or even leap off a cliff and scary movies and spooky attractions give everyone a chance to feel the high.\n\n\u201cBasically, you are getting a rush of physiology,\u201d LeDoux says.\n\nMore from The Body Odd:",

The earthquake ruptured along a plate boundary, and is one of several which shows signs of foreshocks caused by slow movement prior to the earthquake, a new study finds.\n\nAfter a destructive earthquake, scientists sifting through the rumbles that preceded the big event often find foreshocks.\n\nForeshocks are smaller temblors that strike in the days and hours before a moderate-to-large earthquake. They're puzzling. Not all earthquakes have foreshocks, and despite decades of effort, no one has successfully found a way to predict earthquakes using foreshocks.\n\nNow, a new study may help explain some of the mysteries surrounding these enigmatic earthquakes.\n\nAt plate boundaries, the interface between two of Earth's tectonic plates, foreshocks result from slow, creeping movement between the two plates before big earthquakes rupture more rapidly, according to a study published today (March 24) in the journal Nature Geoscience. As the fault creeps, small, stuck zones resist this slow movement and eventually break, generating foreshocks, explained study co-author Virginie Durand, a graduate student in seismology at the Institute of Earth Science (ISTerre) in Grenoble, France.\n\nThus, foreshocks aren't triggers for earthquakes, as was once thought, Durand told OurAmazingPlanet. Instead, \"these events can tell us how an earthquake begins,\" she said. \"And if we understand better where and how earthquakes begin, we can better mitigate earthquake hazard.\"\n\nPlate boundariesFor the study, Durand and her colleagues looked at earthquakes bigger than magnitude 6.5 along the edge of the Pacific Ocean, where Taiwan, Japan, the United States and Mexico operate dense seismic monitoring networks. Between 1999 and 2011, half of the earthquakes tested were on plate boundaries (22 subduction zone quakes and nine strike-slip) and half were so-called intraplate earthquakes. [ Video: What Does Earthquake 'Magnitude' Mean? ]\n\nSubduction zones are collision zones between two plates, where one bends down and dives under the other. Strike-slip boundaries are where plates slide horizontally past one another. Intraplate quakes hit away from the massive faults that mark plate boundaries.\n\nWhile the pattern for each plate boundary earthquake was unique, on average, the seismicity along the faults was nearly constant until about two months before a big earthquake, when there was a small but noticeable increase, the researchers found. Seismicity refers to the geographic and time distribution of earthquakes.\n\nMitigating future riskThe increase became more pronounced about 20 days before the main event. Earthquake frequency continued accelerating about two days before, then a few hours before, and kept increasing until the final convulsion, the study found.\n\n\"This observation suggests that an earthquake is preceded by the slow slip of the two plates in contact,\" Durand said.\"If confirmed, the relatively long duration of this nucleation phase may help mitigate earthquake risk in the future.\"\n\nThere was no clear pattern in earthquakes away from plate boundaries, on the intraplate quakes, an observation that could help explain the puzzling lack of foreshocks for some earthquakes.\n\nFuture research will confirm whether the pattern is present in other earthquake zones around the world, and if monitoring faults for creeping movements and foreshocks could be used to forecast future earthquakes on certain types of faults. It's not known if the pattern also appears along faults when there are no earthquakes, the researchers point out.\n\nEmailBecky Oskinor follow her@beckyoskin.

It\u2019s also a possible infringement on privacy, the group says.\n\nFifteen years ago, the Supreme Court established the legality for school-based drug testing for students. Proponents of the practice say that random testing at schools deters students from using drugs.\n\nBut the AAP says they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s worth the costs to schools. \u201cWe want to be really clear about this\u2014this is not pushing schools to the side or saying they have no role,\u201d says report author Dr. Sharon Levy, the director of the Adolescent Substance Abuse Program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of what\u2019s the best way for schools to be involved.\u201d\n\nAccording to the AAP policy statement, there\u2019s limited evidence to suggest that drug testing programs in schools prevent kids from trying drugs. \u201cWe reviewed the studies done to take a look at this question, and while there\u2019s evidence, there are a lot of caveats around that,\u201d says Levy, who adds that many studies rely on self-reports and show inconsistent data.\n\nThe tests are imperfect, sometimes showing anxiety-inducing false negatives and false positives, the AAP says. While drug tests should be used to find students who may need intervention, the AAP believes, studies have shown that students are often given severe consequences like suspensions or expulsions that are not followed up by treatment. The tests can also detect substances used by young people for medical reasons, which could result in breaches of their privacy and damage the relationship between schools and their students, the AAP says.\n\n\u201cRandom drug testing, particularly on the scale of these drug-testing programs which are typically once or twice a year, is not very likely to pick up sporadic use, which is the majority of use by high school kids,\u201d says Levy. \u201cIt depends how important you think it is to pick up sporadic use, but I think it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also add that drug tests don\u2019t typically pick up on alcohol, which is the illegal substance most commonly used by adolescents and teens.\n\nLevy says that the goal of the new policy statement is not to stop schools from actively seeking out students who are at risk for drug use, but to weigh the best strategies. Instead, the AAP recommends school-based prevention and intervention programs, education, other screening methods like confidential self-reports, counseling and referrals.\n\nLevy says she recognizes that not all experts may agree, but that she and her panel crafted their statement based on the most recent evidence available. She hopes that pediatricians and schools can collaborate to find the most effective ways to help students resist drugs.",

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.\n\n\"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that.

Johnson, a two-time Pro Bowler who rushed for a combined 3,639 yards in 2005-06, had collected just 358 yards on the ground in seven games this season.\n\nDoes he have talent left? Johnson will be 30 on Nov. 19, and hasn't rushed for more than 900 yards since 2006. His former coach, Dick Vermeil, said of Johnson to the Kansas City Star on Monday: \"He is what he is. He's a complex guy to work with.\"\n\nAny team can place a waiver claim on Johnson and pay the balance of his salary. But if he clears waivers, he'll be eligible to sign with any club.\n\nHere's a synopsis of teams that have been connected to Johnson after his release:\n\n-- Steelers: ESPN reported that Johnson would like to join the Steelers, the team the AP reported he had hoped would draft him in 2003. But Pittsburgh has been relying on second-year player Rashard Mendenhall as starter recently, with Willie Parker and Mewelde Moore behind him.\n\n-- Redskins: Head coach Jim Zorn wouldn't rule out pursuing Johnson on Monday. The Redskins lost Clinton Portis to a concussion on Sunday, and his status for next week is in doubt. The team signed veteran Shaun Alexander as insurance last season. Asked specifically about Johnson, Zorn said, \"I need to have a longer conversation than I've had to make a decision.\"\n\n-- Seahawks: They cut veteran Edgerrin James last week, after the veteran rushed for just 125 yards in seven games for them. Leading rusher Julius Jones (382 yards) hasn't been explosive. But head coach Jim Mora expressed doubt that Seattle would make a bid for Johnson. \"No,\" he said. \"Right now, we'll just stick with what we've got.\"\n\n-- Patriots: Bill Belichick's team has lost RBs Sammy Morris and Fred Taylor to injury for significant chunks of the season. But Belichick, in a radio appearance on Monday, said the team would be unlikely to chase Johnson. \"I would doubt it,\" he said, via the Boston Globe.\n\n-- Bears: Head coach Lovie Smith acknowledged on Monday that Chicago would consider Johnson. The Bears have Matt Forte as their lead rusher, but lack quality depth behind him. \"Any player that's available, we look at,\" Smith told reporters. \"That's been our standard policy throughout. That'll be the case with Larry.\"\n\n-- Texans: Starter Steve Slaton was benched for veteran Ryan Moats last week, and the Texans have the sort of instability at tailback where Johnson could come in and challenge for the starting job. Head coach Gary Kubiak acknowledged on Monday that Houston would consider Johnson. \"When a name like that comes on the free agent market like today, we'll obviously go back and take a look at him just like any other player,\" Kubiak told reporters. \"Obviously, he's been a good player in this league and I'm sure he'll get a lot of interest from a lot of people.\"\n\n-- Sean LeahyHat tip: AP",

This moves Penney further into junk status, with S&P saying the chain\u2019s performance remains weak. Concerns are growing about the firm\u2019s ability to turn its business around. Penney posted a bigger-than-expected loss and a 20 percent drop in revenue in the first quarter as shoppers were turned off by a new pricing plan that eliminates hundreds of sales in favor of lower everyday prices. The changes were put in place by a new CEO \u2013 former Apple retailing whiz Ron Johnson. He overhauled every aspect of JC Penney\u2019s business from pricing to the brands it carries. Analysts expect that the business remains challenging in the current quarter.\n\nIt may be the closest thing yet to an official pronouncement that the housing market has finally started getting better \u2013 five years after the bubble burst.

The Wall Street Journal reports \u201cthe housing market has turned \u2013 at last.\u201d A survey by Wells Fargo Securities economists finds that even as the recovery slows down \u201cthe budding recovery in the housing market appears to be gradually gaining momentum.\u201d\n\nBut the foreclosure crisis is far from over. Foreclosures fell 11 percent in the first half of this year but RealtyTrac, the firm that tracks the numbers, says banks are increasingly putting troubled property owners on notice for possible action. There could be a rise in auction sales and bank repossessions by early next year. California in particular saw a big spike in homes placed on the foreclosure path for the first time. The Mortgage Bankers Association says about 3 million U.S. homes are behind on their mortgages.\n\nSparks could fly at a Senate hearing next Tuesday. The Financial Times reports the global bank HSBC is set to apologize to members of a Senate investigative panel \u201cfor failing to have appropriate controls in place\u201d to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism. According to the FT, analysts estimate the wrongdoing by the bank may cost it up to $1 billion in fines. The HSBC apology comes a week after the CEO of Barclays was forced to resign after the bank was hit by a huge fine by US and British regulators for attempting to fix LIBOR borrowing rates.\n\nDirectTV has pulled the plug on Viacom Channels, including MTV Nikelodeon and Comedy Central.

The parts include a telescoping eight-foot aluminum extension pole that enables one to work effectively up to about 13 feet (a twist-lock clamp keeps the extension securely locked); a clamp that will grip a cloth, scouring pad, mop head or sponge and fits onto the end of the extension pole; a deck brush (eight-inch block) that can be bolted to the face of the clamp; an extra-large sponge that fits into the clamp, and a squeegee handle that can accommodate the three different lengths of rubber also included in the kit.\n\nAlso included are a length of replacement rubber blade material for the squeegee; a four-inch scraper blade that snaps into the squeegee handle and is useful for scraping windows and tiles (five blades included), and, for washing windows and other flat surfaces, a very lightweight washing tool especially made to absorb cleaning materials.\n\nThe entire kit can be purchased for $77, and any of the parts can be purchased separately.

''For the most part it's true - they do save money,'' he added.\n\nHigh Bar is a wholesale food company that also sells retail. Unlike the majority of wholesalers and restaurant-supply houses, it imposes no minimum, such as large case lots, on purchases.\n\nThe only catch when it comes to most of the food products carried by High Bar is that one must be able to use institutional-size packages. Canned goods are packed in six-pound tins, artificial sweetener comes in thousand-packet boxes, herbs and spices are sold by the pound instead of the ounce, the standard size for barbecue sauce is a gallon, and butter is available only in solid one-pound bricks, not convenient quarters.\n\nBut the savings can be substantial. For example, a two-pound box of Pepperidge Farm goldfish crackers is $3.75, a pound of Wise potato chips is $1.75, three pounds of frozen spinach runs $1.25, Hotel Bar butter is $1.69 a pound, a seven-pound can of B & M brand baked beans is $3.75, 25 ounces of Rose's lime juice is $2.95 and most of the herbs and spices run from $2.25 to $3.95 a pound.\n\n''The average family of four would find it difficult to use a sixpound can of peaches, said Mr. Nagler, who owns the business with his father, Nat. ''We don't carry retail sizes. Still, a lot of what we carry is useful on a day-to-day basis, like the artificial sweetener or two pounds of frozen broccoli.''\n\nMr. Nagler added that for retail customers, his cheeses and cold cuts represented particularly economical items: ''Jarlsberg is $2.59 a pound, Ile de France Brie is $3.25 and boiled ham only $1.99. Where can you beat that?''\n\nAlthough an estimated 70 percent of High Bar's business is wholesale, the strictly cash-and-carry retail trade is an important factor. ''They help each other,'' Mr. Nagler said. ''The retail end gives me the cash flow to pay my creditors while I wait 30, 60, 90 or even 120 days to collect my accounts from restaurants, schools and hospitals. And in this economy, the retail part has unlimited potential.''\n\nMr. Nagler said he would like to double his present 3,300 square feet of floor space to accommodate all the products he carries. The store is a tightly packed jumble of cans and boxes piled upon one another on plain metal shelves.\n\nMany of the retail customers are party givers, both individuals and organizations doing their own catering. Mr. Nagler said his staff was trained to assist people who had no idea how much cheese or mustard to buy for 100 guests.\n\nIn addition to food products and bar supplies, High Bar has an extensive line of foil, paper and plastic accessories. ''We can do everything from the tablecloth to the dessert and toothpicks,'' Mr. Nagler said. Some items of institutional cookware, such as stainlesssteel mixing bowls and spoons, are very good values here.\n\nMr. Nagler remarked that he could not undersell the supermarkets on certain items such as coffee, sugar, flour and tuna fish because of the price and discounting structure of that business. ''I may not be Zabar's and I'm not Waldbaum's, but there's a lot of room in between,'' he said.\n\nHigh Bar, at 2919 Long Beach Road, in Oceanside, is open from 8 A.M to 5 P.M. Mondays through Fridays and from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. on Saturdays. The telephone number is 766-4009. No credit cards are accepted.\n\nAnother High Bar store, at 55 Broadway in Hicksville, is a separately owned franchise.",

The middle child feels unloved, ignored and unheard. While the pampered younger one just waits around for everything to happen to them.\n\nBut as with most generalizations, the whole idea that the day you were born somehow determines the type of person you grow up to be is just that \u2013 an idea.\n\nClinical psychologist Dr. Melissa Keogh told news.com.au that while birth order has been an obsession of psychological study for decades, the most recent scientific research has dumped these theories on their behind.\n\nAmerican psychologist Dr. Alan Stewart\u2019s 2012 study on this theory found that a person\u2019s perceived birth order has more of an impact on their psychological development than their actual birth order.\n\n\u201cPsychological birth order is our perceived birth order. That means the place in the family we \u2018feel ourselves\u2019 to be. For instance, you might actually have been born first in your family but feel as if everyone in your family treats you like the youngest. Or vice versa,\u201d said Keogh.\n\nAccording to Keogh\u2019s clinical experience, these feelings and perceptions can often be felt more keenly when there have been significant changes or disruption to the family unit.\n\n\u201cThat can happen when a child is sick or passes away and when there is a large gap in the ages between siblings. In instances of multiple births it\u2019s also harder to separate your identity from your siblings. You find it harder to work out who you are,\u201d she said.\n\nBut \u2013 it\u2019s very important to remember that a person\u2019s perceptions are not reality and that\u2019s probably a good thing.\n\n\u201cWe can change our perceptions, we can\u2019t change the date we were born,\u201d said Keogh.\n\nChanging perceptions starts with thinking about what motivates us in life \u2013 and understanding what is important in light of our experiences, education and relationships outside of the family dynamic.\n\nParents also play a pivotal role in making sure their children avoid buying into these birth-order stereotypes in the first place.\n\nKeogh said they need to make sure they don\u2019t pass on their biases or expectations to children and allow each of them to develop in their own way and in their own time.\n\n\u201cWe really have to be careful of that sort of stuff. School experiences, friendships, and life experiences all shape the person we become,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story originally appeared on news.com.au",

I was incredibly disappointed and blamed myself,\u201d Parker writes. \u201cI didn\u2019t watch basketball or go to the gym for several days.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s college legacy was a letdown: No. 3 seed Duke was upset early in the NCAA tournament, losing to Mercer. If he instead chose to stay with Duke, he could have a chance to redeem his team in next year\u2019s tournament.\n\nBut ultimately, after meeting with Coach K and his parents to discuss his options, Parker settled on the NBA:\n\nWhich environment \u2014 college or the NBA \u2014 offers me the best opportunity to grow as a basketball player?\n\nWhich environment \u2014 college or the NBA \u2014 offers me the best opportunity to grow and develop off the court?\n\nThe answer to both questions is undeniably the NBA.\n\nParker will likely be a top pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft on June 26. He was the highest-scoring freshman in Duke history, averaging 19.1 points per game and becoming the first freshman to lead Duke in both scoring and rebounding.\n\nThe beginning of Parker\u2019s professional career does not mean the end of his education: Parker said that he plans to graduate from Duke while he\u2019s in the NBA. Parker\u2019s decision to enter the draft also means he\u2019ll forgo his two-year mission common among 19-year-olds at the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints.

What\u2019s more, don\u2019t expect an intelligent debate about energy policy in the presidential campaign. Mitt Romney, while not a climate-change denier, believes the U.S. shouldn\u2019t take unilateral action on what is fundamentally a global and borderless issue. President Obama rails against speculators influencing gas prices, an assertion so laughably irrelevant that he signals where he stands on the subject of promoting an intelligent energy debate. (At least not this year.)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s good news. If Washington can\u2019t get its act together, then the action is in the states. It\u2019s a point hedge fund honcho Tom Steyer made Tuesday at the Fortune Brainstorm Green conference in Laguna Niguel, Calif. His new Advanced Energy Economy initiative is focused on state and local initiatives, bypassing the nation\u2019s capital in its advocacy efforts.\n\nIndividual states, in fact, are the brightest spots of bipartisan action on energy policy. \u201cThirty-five states have renewable energy requirements,\u201d said William Reilly, EPA administrator under George H. W. Bush. \u201cAnd Republicans are not attacking those because they are creating jobs.\u201d Reilly cited the red state of Arizona as a prime example. Fred Krupp, boss of the notably bipartisan Environmental Defense Fund calls out Colorado, with a Democratic governor, for its disclosure requirements around fracking. (Frackers cracking the ground for natural gas need to disclose every chemical they pump into the ground; Look here for a basic explanation of fracking.)\n\nIf there has been a theme to this year\u2019s Fortune conference, it\u2019s quite gloomy. Gone is talk of \u201ccap and trade.\u201d Carbon taxes are a pipe dream. National leadership is absent on any of these issues. Yet there is always hope. Reilly, now an adviser to the private-equity firm TPG, ticks off positive developments of recent years: the 54-mile-per-gallon agreement among the auto companies and the Obama administration; the EPA enforcement of regulations to displace aging coal-fired electric plants with natural-gas-burning facilities; and the ubiquity of ultra-cheap, relatively clean natural gas.\n\nThere even is hope for action at the federal level. \u201cIf you looking for a clear policy today, you go to the states,\u201d said John Podesta, a key Obama adviser who runs the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress. \u201cThat could change in 2013,\u201d he said.",

Schreuder, who was then 16, shot his grandfather with a .375 magnum.\n\nHer son was arrested on the murder charge in Manhattan last October. The warrant also charges Mrs. Schreuder with having obtained the murder weapon and given it to her son because Mr. Bradshaw was reportedly disinheriting them both from his estate, which was worth more than $500 million.\n\nMrs. Schreuder was not in Utah at the time of the killing, the police said. Lived Near Gracie Mansion\n\nMrs. Schreuder was arrested yesterday morning in her apartment at 10 Gracie Square, near Gracie Mansion, as the culmination of a year and a half of joint efforts by prosecutors in Salt Lake City and Manhattan, according to Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney.\n\n''It was for the murder of her father, who was shot by her son in 1978,'' Mr. Morgenthau said. The arrest of Mrs. Schreuder came after the Salt Lake City police said they were able to confirm through ballistics tests that a gun she had obtained here and subsequently asked friends to hide was the murder weapon, according to New York City detectives familiar with the case. Doorman Refused Entrance\n\nMrs. Schreuder - whose arrest was delayed by one day when the doormen at her exclusive apartment building refused entrance to detectives on Thursday because they had no search warrants - became distraught yesterday while being questioned at the 19th Precinct station house on East 67th Street and had to be ''restrained,'' said Mr. Morgenthau.\n\nThe District Attorney said she had been taken to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation. Mr. Morgenthau said that after the results of the observation were reviewed, Mrs. Schreuder would have an extradition hearing to determine if she should be sent to Salt Lake City.\n\nEmployees at Mrs. Schreuder's apartment building said she had lived there for about a year and a half with a daughter, who is 9 or 10 years old, and that her son had visited her occasionally for long periods.",

The researchers found those on brand-name diets saw only small variations in the amount of weight lost.\n\n11 simple weight loss tips\n\n\"There may be important differences to some individual clinicians or some individual dieters, but overall the differences are minimal,\" Johnston said.\n\nIn addition, exercise and behavioral support enhanced weight loss. Behavioral support includes things like group support, counseling and/or meeting with a registered dietitian.\n\nAfter a year, many people stopped losing weight and gained a couple of pounds back. The average sustained weight loss was 16 pounds.\n\nThe researchers noted exercise continued to enhance weight loss, whereas the results for behavioral support were no longer significant after a year.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Linda Van Horn of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago argued that limiting carbohydrates or fat can be risky. Focusing solely on weight loss, she wrote, only makes these popular diets seems healthy.\n\n5 ways a healthy diet is making you tired\n\nAs soon as you start reducing or eliminating macronutrients like fat, carbs or protein, you run the risk of avoiding foods that \"actually have a host of nutrients to them,\" she said.\n\nPeople who eat a low-carb diet, for example, often miss out on the fiber, potassium, Vitamin C and other phytochemicals that are important to good health.\n\nThe debate over low-fat and low-carb diets has been going on for decades. And the JAMA study likely won't put a stop to it.\n\nJust on Monday, a study of 148 people published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that a low-carb diet is superior to a low-fat one for weight loss. Participants on the low-carb diet reduced their cardiovascular risk factors. They also saw reductions in fat mass, along with improved cholesterol levels.\n\nLow-carb, high-protein diets linked to women's heart disease\n\n\"With the obesity epidemic, everyone is really interested in the best way, the easiest way to lose weight,\" said Lauri Wright, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, who was not involved in either study.\n\n\"For every one study that shows the low-carb is better, then there's a counterstudy that shows that low-fat is better. And it's very confusing.\"\n\nWright recommends people see a dietitian to develop an individualized plan.\n\n\"We're not only trying to lose weight, but we're also trying to prevent diseases too,\" she added. \"We want to make sure the diet is not only low in calories, but it has really high-quality nutrition value.\"",

His appointment to the F.T.C. is expected to have a strong impact on the way the regulatory agency works.\n\n''My basic philosophy reflects the President's own,'' Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview. ''I have, like most economists, a great appreciation for the marketplace, which needs regulatory relief. It's not that we need to cut the pie smaller, we need to make the pie grow larger.'' Government regulations, Mr. Miller feels, represent one of the chief negatives in the equation - an equation that started out to redress inequities but has since become part of the problem. ''Simple changes have ramifications beyond the original scene, and there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,'' Mr. Miller said.\n\nUnder Mr. Miller, the commission is likely to find itself working within a very narrow mandate. Remarking that he still faced confirmation hearings, Mr. Miller declined to discuss his plans for running the F.T.C.\n\nThe F.T.C. has encountered hard times in the last several years, as the mood of the country shifted to one of regulatory caution. In the early and mid-1970's, the commission broke new ground in the area of antitrust law and consumer protection, as it operated under new powers from Congress and broad interpretations of old mandates. Crackdown by Congress\n\nBut last year, Congress cracked down on the agency's powers. The Reagan Administration has already cut the commission's budget and attempted to remove its antitrust authority. Most of the antitrust cases that brought it into the limelight during the last decade have quietly died since January or have been severely curtailed.\n\n''Jim has the talent of focusing on what are the important things that need to get done and not getting sidetracked,'' said one budget official who has worked closely with Mr. Miller.\n\nAs an example of that focus, others cite the swiftness with which Mr. Miller was able to get a coalition of support behind President Reagan's Executive Order 12291, which requires executive branch departments and regulatory agencies to do cost-benefit analyses of new regulations and submit the results to the Office of Management and Budget before issuing new regulations. Research Aide With Two Groups\n\nMr. Miller received his undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Georgia in 1965. He received his doctorate, also in economics, from the University of Virginia in 1969 and afterward served as a senior staff economist with the Department of Transportation. During 1972, he also worked as a research associate at the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute, both Washington-based economic research organizations.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974 he was associate professor of economics at Texas A & M University, as well as a consultant to the Department of Transportation and the National Bureau of Standards.\n\nFrom 1974 to late 1975, he was a member of the senior staff of the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as being an adjunct scholar with the enterprise institute. In October 1975, he served as assistant director for government operation and research on the Council on Wage and Price Stability. Resident Scholar at Institute\n\nBeginning in 1977 and until his budget appointment this year, he was an enterprise institute resident scholar and co-director of its Center for the Study of Government Regulation.\n\nMr. Miller was born on June 25, 1942, in Conyers, Ga., the eldest of six children. His father, James C. Miller Jr., is a retired Delta Air Lines pilot; his mother, Annie, is a real estate broker.\n\nMr. Miller married the former Demaris Humphries and they reside in the District of Columbia and have three children: Katrina, 11 years old;, Felix, 10, and Sabrina, 8.\n\nMr. Miller relaxes by riding his motorcycle, backpacking with his family and operating his ham radio set. ''His absolute favorite hobby, though, is playing Dixieland trumpet, which he plays with records,'' Mrs. Miller said.\n\nIllustrations: photo of James Clifford Miller 3d",

Mr. Miller, who learned of his nomination yesterday, on his 39th birthday, has helped lead the Reagan Administration's drive to shrink Government regulation, first as head of the transition group that studied regulations and currently as a top staff member of the Office of Management and Budget and executive director of the Presidential Task Force for Regulatory Relief. His appointment to the F.T.C. is expected to have a strong impact on the way the regulatory agency works.   ''My basic philosophy reflects the President's own,'' Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview. ''I have, like most economists, a great appreciation for the marketplace, which needs regulatory relief. It's not that we need to cut the pie smaller, we need to make the pie grow larger.'' Government regulations, Mr. Miller feels, represent one of the chief negatives in the equation - an equation that started out to redress inequities but has since become part of the problem. ''Simple changes have ramifications beyond the original scene, and there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,'' Mr. Miller said."

Throw it out and buy a new bottle.\u201d\n\nMost sunscreens have an expiration date or a tub symbol that contains a number to indicate how many months it\u2019ll keep for once you\u2019ve opened it.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t find a use-by date, then write the month and year of purchase on the bottle,\u201d suggests Michelle.\n\nAnd just like you check best-before dates in the supermarket before you buy food, do the same with your sunscreen.\n\nSo you know that UVA ages skin and UVB burns it? Top marks.\n\nBut have you heard about the other ray you need to protect yourself from?\n\n\u201cNew research shows infrared \u2013 longer wavelengths in the sun\u2019s electromagnetic irradiation \u2013 can harm skin, too,\u201d says dermatologist Dr Stefanie Williams.\n\nBecause infrared-A (IR-A) rays are longer than other rays, they can penetrate deeper into the skin, causing wrinkles and collagen damage.\n\nThankfully, a number of sunscreen brands now offer triple protection \u2013 try Garnier Ambre Solaire Sensitive Advanced Very High SPF50+, \u00a38, or Lloyds Pharmacy Solero Sun Lotion SPF30, \u00a37.\n\nOwn up. How often have you had a sunbed session just before your summer holiday, \u201csafe\u201d in the knowledge a base tan will stop you burning when you hit the beach?\n\n\u201cThe idea that a tan is the best sun protection is a dangerous misconception,\u201d says Dr Williams.\n\n\u201cStudies show that not only is sunburn a sign of skin damage, but even a tan is a sign that the skin\u2019s DNA has been damaged.\u201d\n\nPlus, sunbeds pose another danger. The Melanoma Research Foundation says regular exposure to tanning beds before the age of 30 can increase a person\u2019s risk of developing melanoma skin cancer by up to 75%.\n\nIf you usually leave your bottle of SPF baking in the sun with you, then get it in the shade pronto, because it stops working when stored above 25\u00b0C.\n\n\u201cThe ultraviolet- absorbing chemicals degrade at high temperatures, rendering them ineffective,\u201d says Michelle.\n\nIf you\u2019re out in the sun all day, keep your sunscreen in a cool bag or next to a cold drink bottle in a shady place.\n\nAnd if you kept last summer\u2019s sunscreen in a car or beach bag, replace it.\n\nIf you only use sunscreen on skin that\u2019s on show, you\u2019re taking a risk, says Dr Williams: \u201cUnless you\u2019re wearing special SPF clothing, your T-shirt or top will only provide the equivalent of 2-10 SPF. Loosely woven fabrics and light colours such as white offer next to no protection. And if the fabric is wet, the SPF goes down even further.\u201d\n\nSo before you get dressed, slap that SPF on all over.\n\nEven if you\u2019re scrupulous about applying sunscreen, it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that any medication you are taking could also increase the risk of sunburn.\n\nPainkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen, antidepressants, oral contraceptives and retinoids used to treat acne and wrinkles, such as tretinoin, can all make the skin more photosensitive.\n\nPhoto-allergic reactions usually appear as exaggerated sunburn up to 24 hours after sun exposure.\n\nThe best advice? If you\u2019re outside for long periods of time, use a sunscreen of SPF30 or higher that protects from various rays, and seek out the shade \u2013 how often will depend on your colouring.\n\nOne easy way to check is with My UV Patch from La Roche-Posay.\n\nThis stick-on sensor changes colour when you\u2019re in danger of burning, and is free while stock lasts from selected Boots stores.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more annoying than a gloomy forecast when you want to hit the beach.\n\nBut at least you won\u2019t burn your skin through the clouds, right? \u201cWrong,\u201d says skin expert Dr Maryam Zamani.\n\n\u201cUVA rays occur all year round, whatever the weather. And a whopping 80% of the sun\u2019s harmful rays can still penetrate clouds and damage your skin.\u201d\n\nThat means you still need to wear cream even when the sun isn\u2019t shining.",

We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\"\n\nThe thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air.\n\nMusic resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n\nOther performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour.\n\nArcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.\n\nBravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.\n\nThey  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs.\n\nAs well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.\n\nFrontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance.\n\nThe set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).\n\nThe group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.\n\nPlus, they have really catchy choruses.\n\nThe band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.\n\nAs the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage.\n\n\"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\"\n\nThe feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday.\n\n\"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a nice vibe. There's lots of families.\n\n\"It's not just about massive headlining acts.

The offers will be embedded in their statement in a separate tab and are redeemable only with Bank of America credit or debit cards, Reuters reported. Customers will pay full price for purchases related to the deal, but get cash back in their accounts the following month.\n\nThe second-largest bank in the country will reportedly offer the service for free to customers but has yet to announce when the program will launch. The bank is testing the service with employees in North Carolina, South Carolina and Nevada and will roll out the program to more employees in February.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to deliver easy, relevant offers to our customers at places where our customers already shop,\u201d Tara Burke, spokeswoman for Bank of America, said.\n\nBurke said the bank does not share customers\u2019 personal information with third-party vendors, and customers\u2019 privacy and security is the most important priority.\n\nAdam Levin, chairman and co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911, said there are potential privacy concerns about the service.\n\n\u201cBank of America has our spending data anyway, and has been waiting for a way to monetize it without giving the impression that customers are paying more than usual,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile most consumers say they are against being tracked by institutions, they tend to be less resistant if it saves them money or provides convenience, Levin said. Bank of America will not receive payments from customers or merchants.\n\nThe bank said customer data will be safeguarded. The matching of customers and offers will take place on software hosted on the bank\u2019s hardware, in its data center behind the bank\u2019s firewall, and without using personal identifiable information, Javelin Strategy and Research reported.\n\nAfter fallout from the bank\u2019s failed debit card fee proposal, which led to a 20 percent increase in closed accounts last quarter, Levin said the bank is trying to get customers to use its products more.\n\n\u201cThe bank is asking, \u2018How do we make people feel warm and squishy about us as a bank, and how do we make customer experience more interesting?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen BankAmeriDeals is offered to customers, Levin said he expects other banks or card networks to simulate the services.\n\n\u201cThose in the banking industry are lemmings. If one does something and it works, then they all do it,\u201d he said.\n\nJames Sinegal, analyst for independent investment research firm Morningstar Inc., said Bank of America \u201cneeds to catch up\u201d to card networks, like Visa, Discover, MasterCard and American Express, and issuers, or banks, offering expansive discounts.\n\n\u201cOn the surface, it makes sense,\u201d Sinegal said. \u201cThe service will deepen customer relationships. It should definitely lead people to use their Bank of America cards more.\u201d\n\nAmerican Express increased the amount they spent on rewards programs by 10 percent in the last three quarters of last year, which Sinegal was significant.\n\n\u201cCompanies have definitely been getting more aggressive in their rewards options and they hope to make that up with increased volume,\u201d Sinegal said.\n\nSinegal said the new service is part of a larger trend of card networks fight for transaction volumes and accompanying fees charged to merchants. Sinegal said competition is going to heat up in credit card rewards. That may good for consumers but merchants could be squeezed in the process.\n\n\u201cIt depends what percentage they are willing to pay. There is some bargaining that goes on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe merchants are also hoping to get more volume in participating in this like with Groupon.\u201d",

Kind of sad, too. Fifteen seconds into his UFC showdown with Randy Couture, James Toney was on his back, fighting for his life. He remained there for three minutes, absorbing the kind of haymakers from Couture that used to glance harmlessly off of him in the boxing ring. The end mercifully came at 3:19 of the first round, when to the delight of the capacity crowd at the TD Garden, Couture stalled the blood flow to Toney's brain with a suffocating arm triangle.\n\nThe UFC billed Toney-Couture as a true clash of combat sports. But that couldn't be further from the truth. The 42-year old Toney, fat and flabby, his stomach spilling over his trunks is hardly representative of the best -- or even the average -- boxing has to offer. Toney took this fight (chased it, really) for the money, a reported $750,000 windfall he couldn't come close to making anywhere else.\n\nBut Toney hasn't been a viable boxer for some time. His last significant win came in 2003, when a more svelte Toney stopped Evander Holyfield in a stunning ninth round TKO. Since then Toney has outlasted immortals like Dominick Guinn, Danny Batchelder and Fres Oquendo and mixed in a pair of losses to Samuel Peter with a pair of positive tests for steroids.\n\nSimply put, Toney was out of options. So he packed his bags, came to Boston and played his part. He bashed the UFC (\"They're not used to anything like me\") and insulted Couture at every opportunity. And when the time came, he took his beating and walked away with all his limbs still intact.\n\nDid it prove anything? Not really. Toney had about as much chance of beating Couture in the octagon as Couture has of beating Toney in the ring. Make no mistake, put Couture, a UFC Hall of Famer, inside the ropes with Toney and the former three-division champion eats him alive. At best it's a one-sided decision. At worst, Toney puts Couture's lights out early.\n\nTruth is, there will never be a way to settle the boxing-MMA debate. They are separate sports with separate skill sets. That's not to say we won't see exhibitions like this again. UFC 118 was (in theory) headlined by a lightweight rematch between Frank Edgar and B.J. Penn, but a sizeable chunk of the capacity crowd (as well as thousands of boxing fans who plunked down $44 to watch on Pay Per View) were there to see if the loud mouthed Toney could really back up his tough talk.\n\nThe fact that he couldn't changes nothing -- though the UFC has to hope for a more entertaining card than the utterly listless fights on Saturday night's show. There will always be boxers like Toney, faded stars who are hoping to cash in on their names to make a quick buck.\n\nOne of them could be Toney himself. After the fight, a wobbled and woozy Toney said he wanted to continue his UFC career. His campaign as a boxer is finished. His promoter can't get him a fight because nobody wants to fight him. Not out of fear -- Toney's slick, shoulder rolling style doesn't send shivers down any heavyweight's spine -- but because Toney doesn't bring anything to the table. He's a guaranteed win, sure. But he doesn't sell tickets and no network is interested in him.\n\nThe UFC -- or another MMA organization -- may be his last shot. But if he's smart, he should get out while he still can. Years of punishment in the ring has slurred Toney's speech and eroded his natural instincts. A heavy-handed MMA fighter could do some serious damage to Toney's skull. And it's not like Toney's throwing himself into it. He refused to reveal his weight before the Couture fight, though he looked thicker than the 217 pounds he weighed in his last fight with gloves on.\n\nToney should retire. Take the cash the UFC head honcho Dana White is handing him and walk away. Do it now before a doctor has to do it later.",

(AP Photo/Mike Groll) ALBANY, NEW YORK\u2014History has been made, and on Pride Weekend no less. New York, following the swift signature of the governor, is the 6th and most populous state in the union to have enshrined marriage equality. After a long and sometimes contentious debate, the Republican-controlled Senate of New York passed the bill making gay marriage legal in the state of New York. The vote was 33-29, with 4 Republicans joining 29 Democrats to pass the momentous legislation. Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill shortly after its passage, which will allow couples will be to marry after 30 days. Ceremonies should be under way before the end of July. The passage of marriage equality in New York is seen as a huge victory not just for Governor Cuomo, who made it a political priority for his administration, but for the gay marriage movement as a whole. New York is larger in population than all five previous states who legalized gay marriage combined. This is a sea change moment for civil rights that promises to spark further change throughout the United States.\n\nNew York Gov.

Look for the glitterati to flaunt his creations on Oscar's red carpet on Feb. 22. Here, he shares his travel tips and highlights.\n\nQ: Where have you been recently that you liked or were surprised by?\n\nA: When I went to Tokyo to open my Armani/Ginza Tower concept store, I then flew on to Sydney to see Cate Blanchett's theatre company, which I sponsor. The contrast between these two cities was fascinating \u2014 one so futuristic and bustling, the other supremely laid back. Every time I visit Japan, I am struck by how extraordinarily different the culture is to that in Europe and America. As for Australia, it is a place that seems dedicated to living the good life.\n\nQ: What's the best place you've ever visited and why?\n\nA: That's a very difficult question to answer, as many places have different things to recommend them. I love North Africa for its colors and smells \u2014 the markets are an assault on the senses. But perhaps the place I feel most comfortable at the moment is when I am at sea on board my yacht. The combination of limitless water and blue sky is strangely mesmerizing. I find it relaxing \u2014 a totally unique experience, in which one is reminded of how small man is when compared to nature.\n\nQ: What's your favorite vacation spot and why?\n\nA: The island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean, near Sicily. I first visited this volcanic island more than 35 years ago, and have had a holiday home there for a while now. I am constantly surprised by how relaxing I find my stays there \u2014 my sister says my face changes. I turn off the spotlight, and my eyes are always focused on the clear sky. Pantelleria has a harsh environment \u2014 it is certainly not to everyone's taste \u2014 but I find the experience of the bright daylight, the dry heat, the winds that blow in from Africa, not to mention the crystal-clear water, truly energizing. Walking along the inland trails of the island, that in some way remind me of parts of the Puglia region (in Italy), I get a complete sense of tranquility.\n\nQ: Can you offer an insider tip or recommendation for your favorite vacation place?\n\nA: My advice to anyone visiting Pantelleria is to get down to the shore and swim in the waters that throw up small pieces of black volcanic rock called obsidian. This alkaline rock with its high levels of potassium and sodium is what I use as the basis of my mineral-rich Crema Nera skincare range, which has incredible restorative properties.\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Clark+Kensington, sold only at Ace Hardware stores, earned the highest scores of 65 products evaluated for overall finish, ability to hide, and more.\n\n\u201cWhen choosing paint, don\u2019t \u00adassume a leading brand you swore by last time will do just as well this time around,\u201d said Bob Markovich, home and yard editor for Consumer Reports. \u201cOur tests found paints can vary year to year \u2014 and a bigger name does not always equal a better product.\u201d\n\nConsumer Reports found Clark+Kensington paint to be tops in satin and semigloss finishes, and among the best for flat paints. It was also impressive at hiding, leaving a smooth finish that resisted stains, and scrubbing. Its volatile organic compounds are low enough to meet the toughest, regional California standards.\n\nWhile Clark+Kensington is available only at Ace stores, other paints that were great at hiding, durable, washable, and low in volatile organic compounds, are as close as Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and Benjamin Moore retailers.\n\nNew formulas have improved some paints, but others performed worse than they did just a year ago in Consumer Reports\u2019 test. Compared with earlier versions, the Behr Premium Plus Satin Enamel wasn\u2019t quite as good at hiding and became dull when cleaned.\n\nSome paints such as Olympic One Flat Enamel improved at hiding. Better hiding also helped move Valspar Signature matte and semigloss up in the ratings, joining Behr in besting Benjamin Moore, which costs roughly twice as much, among flat and semigloss paints.\n\nTwenty of Consumer Reports\u2019 top picks let consumers skip priming and paint directly over old finishes, bare wood, and wallboard. One coat of a \u201cRecommended\u201d paint should be enough to hide most colors beneath it, though a second coat adds richness and results in a more even finish even for top performers.\n\nSince colors often look different in different lights, Consumer Reports suggests buying a sample, painting a patch, and living with it for a day or two before buying more. Here are three things to consider when choosing paint:\n\nGo online before hitting the store. Manufacturer and retailer websites and Facebook pages offer a wealth of tips on choosing colors, including photo galleries of finished rooms and calculators to help consumers figure out how much paint will do the trick. They are also the place to check for deals such as free samples, discounts, and rebates if consumers are unhappy with the color after it\u2019s applied.\n\nFind the perfect color. Certain hues are specific to a brand, but retailers can often match colors. Paint-color formula books and color-matching computer technology means consumers don\u2019t have to rely solely on the skills of a sales clerk, though one with a good eye and mixing equipment with clean nozzles may be able to match colors, too.\n\nMatch sheen to surface. The best low-luster satin and eggshell paints offer easy hiding and durability, making them ideal for most surfaces. Flat paints hide flaws better but are less resistant to stains and smudges, so use in low-traffic areas. Semigloss works well for trim and other surfaces that don\u2019t need to be wiped frequently, because repeated cleaning will dull most finishes.",

The latest numbers for 2014-2015 indicate that women made up just 27% of all creators, directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and directors of photography working on broadcast network shows.\n\nBroaden that to include cable and other sources and the number gets even grimmer: women accounted for 25% of those working on network, cable, and Netflix shows. This represents no change from last year\u2014and an increase of just 6% from the first study in 1997-1998.\n\nWomen\u2019s representation in front of the camera is a bit better. The report, which looked at sampling of network, basic and pay cable (A&E, AMC, FX, History, TNT, USA, HBO and Showtime) and Netflix shows, found that 42% of all speaking roles and 42% of major characters were female.\n\nHollywood\u2019s ageism double standard is also evident in the results. Most female characters are in their 20s and 30s (60%) whereas most male characters are in their 30s and 40s (55%). And opportunities plummet for older actresses (not to mention older audience members looking to see themselves reflected onscreen). Thirty-one percent of female characters were in their 30s, 18% were in their 40s, and just 2% were in their 60s or older.\n\nMinorities have an even greater challenge: 77% of female characters were white, 15% were African-American, 3% were Latina, 4% were Asian, and 1% were of \u201csome other\u201d race or ethnicity.\n\nThe good news is that when women do have key creative roles, they are more likely to create more opportunities for women. On network shows with at least one female creator, women comprised 50% of writers\u2014whereas women made up 15% of writers on shows with no female creators. On programs with at least one female executive producer, an average 43% of major characters were female. Compare that to shows no female executive producers, where an average 37% of characters were female.\n\nSince HBO\u2019s Project Greenlight premiere on Sunday, Matt Damon has been getting flack for interrupting Effie Brown, the one African-American female producer on the show, to say that selecting a diverse directing team isn\u2019t the solution to getting better representation of women and minorities on screen. But this report suggests otherwise.\n\nSays Dr. Martha Lauzen, author of the study, \u201cThe findings suggest that creators and executive producers play an instrumental role in shifting the gender dynamics for both on-screen characters and other individuals working in powerful behind-the-scenes roles.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.",

The average for the 15-year mortgage eased to 3.33 percent from 3.38 percent.\n\nRates had risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows about a year ago.\n\nThe increase was driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion-a-month bond purchases, which have helped keep long-term rates low.

The latest plan is to cut the purchases to $55 billion because the Fed thinks the economy is healing.\n\nThe Fed also said last month that even after it raises short-term rates, the job market strengthens, and inflation rises, it expects its benchmark short-term rate to stay low.\n\nChair Janet Yellen said Wednesday that the US job market still needs help from the central bank and that it must remain intent on adjusting its policy as needed.\n\nYellen also made it clear she believes the still-subpar economic recovery will continue to need the help of low rates for some time. An increase in short-term rates would elevate borrowing costs and could hurt stock prices.\n\nTo calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders each week. The average doesn\u2019t include extra fees, called points, borrowers pay to get the lowest rates.

Mortgage Rates had risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows about a year ago. Many analysts have been expecting an improving economy to lift the housing market, which has been recovering over the past two years. But housing has struggled to maintain momentum. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates have held back some potential home buyers. Others have had trouble qualifying for mortgages. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that US home construction rose moderately in March as builders resumed work at the end of a frigid winter. But applications for building permits slid, clouding the outlook for future construction.

Last year Argentina moved into first place among developing countries trading with the Russians, edging out India, the former leader.\n\nThe surge in Soviet-Argentine trade resulted from the imposition of a United States grain embargo on the Soviet Union after its military intervention in Afghanistan in late 1979. The Russians turned to Argentina for grain supplies, and Argentine exports jumped fourfold in 1980 compared with the 1979 level.\n\nLast year President Reagan rescinded the grain embargo, but by then the Russians' newly expanded trade relationship with Argentina appeared to have taken a firm hold. The volume of trade in 1981 was double the 1980 level, or more than $3.4 billion. Ranks as Sixth Largest Partner\n\nThe surge of grain shipments made Argentina the sixth-ranking trade partner of the Soviet Union outside the Soviet bloc. Argentine trade with the Russians is exceeded by that of West Germany, Finland, France, Italy and Japan and outranks Soviet trade with the United States and Britain.\n\nThe next largest Latin American trade partner of the Soviet Union, except for Cuba, is Brazil, with only a fourth of the volume of Argentina.\n\nThe new Soviet-Argentine relationship has been documented by frequent reports in the Soviet monthly magazine Foreign Trade. A long-term accord for the supply of Argentine grain and soybeans, signed in 1980, was supplemented in April 1981 by an agreement on the shipment of Argentine meat to the Soviet Union and in May 1981 by a shipping accord to provide for the transportation of these goods. New Agreements Signed\n\nWhen the Falklands crisis began with the Argentine seizure of the islands April 2, a Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Aleksei N. Manzhulo, was in Buenos Aires to sign additional accords. These provided for the establishment of mixed companies for fishing off the southern Argentine coast and for Soviet enrichment of uranium for an Argentine nuclear power station.\n\nIn 1981, according to Argentine sources, the Russians imported 15.7 million tons of grain and soybeans, or nearly 77 percent of Argentine crop exports. This represented a substantial jump from the 1980 level.\n\nDetailed figures for last year from the Soviet side are yet to be published, but in 1980 the Russians bought 50 percent of Argentina's exported wheat, 59 percent of the barley and as much as 97 percent, or 1.5 million tons, of the exported sorghum. Other Soviet purchases in 1980 included 667,000 tons of Argentine soybeans, or 27 percent of soybean exports, and 84,000 tons of frozen meat, representing 28 percent of Argentina's meat exports.\n\nBefore the surge, Soviet imports from Argentina were mainly in corn, which accounted for half the value of the far lower trade in 1979, as well as meat, wool, hides and linseed oil. 50 to 1 in Argentina's Favor\n\nThe problem for the Soviet Union has been to balance the trade, which has been running 50 to 1 in Argentina's favor. The Russians paid $3.4 billion for Argentine goods last year, compared with the Argentines' payments of $67 million for Soviet goods. Moscow has been financing its grain purchases generally with money earned from the sale of oil, mainly to Western Europe.\n\nMost of the Soviet exports to Argentina have been of electricitygenerating equipment for such projects as the Salto Grande hydroelectric station and for fuel-burning power plants at Costanera and Bahia Blanca. The Russians have also been supplying cranes, trucks, machine tools, ball-bearings and equipment for Argentina's oil and steel industries.\n\nIn an effort to increase exports to Argentina, the Soviet Union has been offering more machinery and equipment. At a session of a joint Soviet-Argentine trade commission last June, the Argentines agreed to purchase more Soviet industrial equipment over the next five years.\n\nThe session laid the groundwork for the fishery accord that was signed in Buenos Aires this month. It also envisioned Soviet participation in the Parana Medio hydroelectric project, planned on the middle reaches of the Parana River.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Argentine helicopter",

What are you supposed to do? You have to do whatever it takes to save their life.\"\n\nJayden\u2019s seizures were an almost daily nightmare, David told CNN. His son\u2019s life was so crippled by the violent shaking caused by Dravet's syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy, he couldn't walk or eat solid food and he had been rushed to the hospital in their hometown of Oakland more than 40 times.\n\nJayden was even taking 22 pills a day, though nothing improved his condition.\n\nSo last year, David gave his son a liquid form of marijuana, which is legal for some medical purposes in California. The results were dramatic, David said.\n\nFor the first time since he was four-months-old, Jayden can now make it through a day without a seizure, his father said.\n\nIn the past year he has been able to walk, run, swim and play with other children.\n\nHis father has also begun to take Jayden off the two dozen anti-seizure pills he had been prescribed, believing they might have kept the boy from developing properly, CNN reported.\n\nHarborside Health Center, a medical marijuana clinic in Oakland, California, said Jayden isn\u2019t the only child patient they help.\n\nChildren with severe autism, epilepsy, ADHD and cancer can be helped by medicinal marijuana, executive director Steven DeAngelo said.\n\n\"What I worry about are the thousands and thousands of children like Jayden who are suffering unnecessarily, who I know we could help,\" he says. \"The only thing separating them from help are outdated rules that need to be changed.\"\n\nBut medical experts think administering medical marijuana to children has unknown risks and potential negative side effects.\n\nA child\u2019s brain \u201ccontinues to undergo important development up until the age of 25...and children and adolescents are at far greater risk of becoming dependent on marijuana, and dependence happens far more quickly,\u201d the California Society of Addiction Medicine argues in a research paper.\n\nBut to David, the benefits have far outweighed the risks.\n\n\"Instead of medical marijuana, this is miracle marijuana,\" he said.\n\nWATCH: Father gives boy medical marijuana",

Security Council resolutions, international agreements and a 1953 armistice halting the Korean War that China helped to negotiate.\n\nThe accusations mark a further deterioration of the tone and direction of the U.S. relationship with Asia's emerging giant and come as both countries prepare for a second summit next month between President Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao.\n\n\"The Chinese embrace of North Korea in the last eight months has served to convince North Korea that China has its back and has encouraged it to behave with impunity,\" said a senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. \"We think the Chinese have been enabling North Korea.\"\n\nThe Korean Peninsula, the official added, has catapulted to the \"top of the security agenda when President Hu comes here . . . and the Chinese are aware of it.\"\n\nObama called Hu on Sunday night to discuss North Korea and urged China to help send a clear message to Pyongyang \"that its provocations are unacceptable,\" the White House said Monday.\n\n\"The president emphasized the need for North Korea to halt its provocative behavior and to meet its international obligations,\" the White House said. \"The president condemned the North Korean shelling of a South Korean island on November 23 and its pursuit of a uranium enrichment program in defiance of its obligations.\" It said Obama \"also highlighted the American commitment to the security of our allies in the region.\"\n\nThe White House statement said Obama and Hu agreed on the importance of working together toward the \"shared goals\" of peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But it made no mention of Hu's response to Obama's complaints about North Korea.\"\n\nA Chinese statement on the phone call said Hu \"regrets the loss of lives and property\" in the North Korean shelling last month. It was the first such comment from Hu about the attack, but it echoed an earlier North Korean expression of regret for killing civilians.\n\nThe U.S. exasperation with China over the Koreas has been evident since June, when Obama accused China of \"willful blindness\" in remaining silent over North Korea's suspected sinking of a South Korean warship in March. But the administration's position now that China is in effect partially to blame for the problems is new.\n\nAt a meeting Monday with the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton hopes to begin the process of tightening the three-way relationship, as a response to the persistent North Korean provocations and China's inaction. The United States and South Korea announced Friday the successful renegotiation of their free-trade agreement, which will be as important strategically as it is economically to the U.S. presence in the region.",

The Supreme Court, rejecting his final appeal, said he was motivated by a desire for sex and to make videos with his victims' corpses.\n\nStill, Japan, host next month to a summit of the Group of Eight industrialized powers, is under mounting international pressure to halt executions.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly, in a nonbinding resolution passed in December, called on all countries to impose a moratorium on executions as a step toward abolishing the death penalty. Human rights groups, the European Union and some Japanese legislators are also leaning on the Tokyo government to impose a moratorium.\n\nJapan and the United States are the only G-8 members that carry out the death penalty. According to Amnesty International, 24 countries conducted executions last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda ruled out any change in policy. \"The majority want it maintained,\" he told news agencies from the G-8 countries. \"I feel there is no need to change it, but we must also keep an eye on world opinion.\"\n\nIn an effort to placate critics, Japan in December modified its practice of shrouding executions in secrecy. It now publicly releases the names and crimes of those hanged -- on the day they are executed. Previously, the information was leaked to newspapers.\n\nThe three hangings Tuesday followed 10 others since Justice Minister Kunio Hatoyama took office.\n\nHatoyama announced in September that he might eliminate a rule requiring the justice minister's signature for every execution. That would allow the government to automatically execute death row inmates within six months after the end of their last appeal, according to Amnesty International. There now 102 people on death row.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Amnesty said the quickening pace of executions here is \"proof that Japan is moving to routinely execute inmates in large numbers.\"\n\nHatoyama denied this and said, \"I'm conducting executions solemnly.\" He added that he ordered Tuesday's executions because \"the cases were of indescribable cruelty.\"\n\nThe hangings took place nine days after a young man with a knife killed seven people in a random attack in downtown Tokyo. Police said Tuesday that they had arrested four people who used the Internet to threaten similar attacks.\n\nThere is rising anxiety in Japan about violent crime, although the rate of random violent attacks has not increased significantly in the past decade.",

He's been through a lot. He's been through numerous offensive coordinators and hasn't really had the chance to develop as a premier quarterback in the NFL. But Harbaugh stepped in and gave him a chance, and Alex took advantage of the opportunity. He might not have all the numbers that Tom Brady and Drew Brees and those guys have got, but he's a winner. He's a winner, and that's all that matters.\n\nTolbert: About the only thing that went wrong last Sunday in Lambeau, you went up for a dunk and just got Mutombo'd by the goalpost ...\n\nByrnes: You knew this question was coming, Vernon ...\n\nTolbert: (laughs) Hey, I've been there before ... It's not a good feeling when the leg goes to jelly and you know you're not going to quite get up there. At what point during that jump did you think, \"I don't know if I have this ...?\"\n\nDavis: You know, as soon as I left my foot ... (all laugh) I said, \"Aw, there's a pain in my foot, I ain't gonna make it ...\" Then I hit the goalpost, and came down ... Wah-wah (sad trombone noise). (all laughing)\n\nByrnes: Did the guys give you a tough time on the flight home?\n\nDavis: No, they just watched on ESPN, and they all started laughing. The whole plane.\n\nByrnes: Watching Coach Harbaugh, it just seems like he's a little off-kilter. There was a shot of him early in the game when the refs were messing up one call after another, and he was basically frothing at the mouth. What is it like playing for Coach Harbaugh?\n\nDavis: It's actually a lot of fun. He's a terrific coach. He brings a lot of energy to the team, and it actually rubs off on me and my teammates. On the field, he's a tough coach, but he can also make you laugh. That's what you want - you don't want to be uptight, you want a coach that's for the team, and that you can relate to. That's why all the guys, every Sunday, they bust their tails for Coach Harbaugh. Because they really appreciate him, and him being around as a head coach.\n\nByrnes: With your defense being as dominant as it is, Vernon - I think undoubtedly the best defense in the NFL - how much easier does that make it for you guys on offense to get into a rhythm?\n\nDavis: Oh, man ... It takes a lot off of us. It eases a lot of stress. The defense we have, they're ruthless - they're out of control, in a good way. You want that kind of a defense: a defense that's going to go in there and take everything from anybody that steps on the field. It's just amazing having them around, because it's not often that you have a defense like that. ... To have that, it really works in our favor. If we make a mistake ... we know that our defense is gonna save us.\n\nThe KNBR Conversation is a weekly interview culled from the archives of KNBR 680/1050 AM.",

It's full of light. It's busy.\n\nThe building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free.\n\nNow the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre.\n\nIt was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town.\n\nA supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing.\n\nBut that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide.\n\nMr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance.\n\nLeicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped.\n\nAt the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government.\n\nIt's the grant cut which is causing them grief.\n\nWhat's called the \"core funding\" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling.\n\nIf we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be \u00a31,686 by 2019/20.\n\nNottinghamshire is mid-table at \u00a31,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with \u00a31,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at \u00a31,354.\n\n\"The funding system is chaotic,\" says Byron Rhodes.\n\n\"It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,\" he says with a glint in his eye.\n\nCould he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there?\n\n\"If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have \u00a350m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have \u00a3100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money.\"\n\nLeicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about \u00a3300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs.\n\nThink back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only  17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled.\n\nLast month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years.\n\nThe money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got \u00a36.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure.\n\nBut it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a \u00a319m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks.\n\nLabour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run authorities such as Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, got nothing.\n\nThe leader of Derby City Council, Ranjit Banwait, has launched a \"fair funding for Derby\" campaign. He says the allocation of government funding is unfair and political and the cuts they're having to impose on leisure services and culture are devastating.\n\n\"Now they are threatening our ability to protect the vulnerable and our ability to function is under threat,\" said Mr Banwait.\n\nBack in Melton Mowbray, Byron Rhodes has some sympathy for the Labour council in Derby.\n\n\"Derby probably have some greater needs,\" he says.\n\nBut once more he is talking about seizing an opportunity in a crisis.\n\nLeicestershire's finance team are working on a submission to put to the government with good arguments on how to restructure the way funds are allocated.\n\n\"We're going to do it. We're going to work up a system which is fairer.\"\n\nHe has the backing of local MPs and is talking to neighbouring authorities.\n\nAnd with a hand out to Derby, he says: \"If they want to talk to us about how to improve things I'm happy to speak to them.\"\n\nIt's a crucial time to get things right. The government is moving to a system where, by 2020, the grant will go.\n\nCouncils will instead get an allocation of funds from the business rates instead.\n\nHow they come up a formula for doing that in a fair way, which helps those authorities with most need, is the next challenge.",

When it\u2019s a child especially, nothing else matters in the whole world until they get well. We comfort them and seek medical help as quickly as possible.\n\nMy granddaughter, Haley, did not have a good day from the time she was 4 years old. She labored to breath, struggled to sit up for herself and could not swallow even one piece of candy like other girls her age. Haley had a progressive and undiagnosed neurological condition which finally ended her life at age 10 last year.\n\nAs the patriarch of our family, I tried desperately to find the answer to Haley\u2019s medical condition. It was a rare month when Haley didn\u2019t spend at least 10 days in the hospital. Thankfully, we knew that we could take our baby in her distress to the hospital and know that she would be cared for and nurtured by the medical professionals there until she felt well enough to go home.\n\nHer life was a joy and brought unspeakable blessings to us. Haley was the perfect picture of trust. She trusted that we would do everything we could to make her feel better. Sometimes that just meant holding her during a breathing treatment. There was no better feeling of gratitude than wheeling Haley in her little wheelchair out of the hospital to go home. We knew we\u2019d be back but at the moment of discharge, there was gratitude for those who took care of her, gave her therapy, started her IVs, and made her smile by helping her feel better, even when it was for just a brief moment.\n\nThat is why the announcement this week that many states are planning to limit inpatient hospital overnights to those covered by Medicare was not only frightening news but also discriminatory against the poor and disabled. It was by God\u2019s grace that my family was able to sustain good medical care for Haley. Don\u2019t all disabled and elderly patients deserve to have the ability to trust that the same awaits them in their hour of need?\n\nTrying to put a limit on illness is like trying to put a 24-hour limit on a sinus infection or a cold sore - it\u2019s impossible. Every illness is unique. Every individual case deserves the care that measures its success on how well the patient is being cared for, not how quickly they can be sent home or denied access to the medical help that they need for as long as they need it. If we, individually or collectively, surrender this core belief to the bureaucrats of the Obama administration, it will only be a matter of time before the \u201cdeath panels\u201d of every hospital will be usurping our rights to medically provide for our loved ones.\n\nIt is already happening. But it is not too late to stop it.\n\nThe men and women of my generation should be able to trust that they will get the care that they gave to us over the years. Standing up to stop rationed health care for those who are the most vulnerable - the elderly, infirmed and disabled adults and children - demands that we expose the lie that euthanasia can no longer be packaged as \u201ccompassion.\u201d\n\nEvery life is precious and has a right to live and be valued. No individual, hospital board, government agency or court has the right to interfere with and decide who lives and who dies.\n\nOur loudest voice can be heard in our vote. It\u2019s time to change out the \"change\" we were told we could believe in.\n\nCollin Raye is a country music star and the National Spokesperson for Terri\u2019s Life and Hope Network.

One of the most generous gifts to the Tories \u2013 \u00a375,000 \u2013 came from Michael Tory, who was in charge of Lehman Brothers\u2019 UK investment banking division when the bank nearly crashed the West\u2019s economy.\n\nSawsan Asfari, wife of long-time Tory donor and oil executive Ayman Asfari, gave \u00a320,000.

Those tunes mean more spending, more borrowing and Britain back to bankruptcy.\u2019\n\nConservative donations totalled just over \u00a3500,000 in the first week of the campaign, with about a quarter coming from donors with links to hedge funds.\n\nDavid Cameron and Ed Miliband are indulging in fantasy economics, the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance claimed. It said both parties were making unrealistic spending pledges to win votes.\n\nThe think-tank\u2019s Jonathan Isaby said: \u2018It\u2019s clear that nobody is facing up to the true scale of the deficit reduction challenge.\n\n'It is a fantasy to pretend that you can balance Britain\u2019s books without significant spending reductions, and politicians must come clean about what they will be.

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 1 sentences.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nWhen news reports revealed recently that airline passengers possibly were exposed to tuberculosis on a flight, we were suddenly and dramatically reminded that TB is still a problem in this country and around world.\n\nAlthough there were just 9,945 cases of TB reported in the United States in 2012 the reason these numbers cannot be ignored is the increasing threat of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), a variation of TB that is considerably more contagious, severe and deadly.\n\nWhat makes the threat even more problematic is that the cause of the spread of MDR-TB is found in the TB treatment regimen itself.\n\nMDR-TB develops because many people afflicted with TB find it too difficult to comply with the multi-drug treatment process and thus stop using the drugs too soon, making their disease drug resistant and more severe.\n\nIndeed a recent World Health Organization report makes clear that the spread of MDR-TB strains poses a real threat worldwide, even in the United States, and that it is essential that we take more comprehensive measures to address it.\n\nIn San Diego for example, 22% of TB cases in 2012 were resistant to at least one of the four major TB drugs and in New York City, the number of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in 2012 is double what it was in 2007. But a breakthrough solution may be as close as our ever present smart phones. This solution offers hope both for patients suffering from TB and for public health departments burdened by the high costs of monitoring treatments.\n\nTypically, health departments in cities across the United States spend millions of dollars to hire professionals to go to TB patients\u2019 homes every day for six months to watch them take their pills and swallow each dose. This treatment protocol, called \"Directly Observed Therapy\" or DOT, while effective, also has significant problems. The process stigmatizes patients and limits their mobility. It is costly and time intensive to administer. And when patients avoid dealing with this inconvenience and stop taking their antibiotics, they are at great risk for MDR-TB.\n\nOnce TB becomes resistant to multiple drugs the treatment of the disease can take years and cure rates decline. In San Diego County, for instance, the TB Control Program spends more than $8.6MM a year on its roughly 300 TB cases, partially due to the high cost of administering DOT programs and the cost to treat drug resistant TB, which can be 50 to 200 times more expensive than standard treatments.\n\nThat's why public health administrators need to be aware of how new mobile technology solutions can be a major contributor to TB treatment and MDR-TB prevention. The University of California, San Diego and U.C. San Diego\u2019s Division of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) are providing an example of how the technology can provide cost effective answers. The solution is stunning in its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nCalled \"Video Directly Observed Therapy\" or VDOT, the process allows TB patients to video record themselves taking their daily medications on Smartphones and then send the videos to health departments.\n\nHealth officials can then remotely monitor and document each dose of medication and store the records on a secure cloud server. A National Institutes of Health evaluation found that with smart phone therapy, 70% more patients were able to successfully recover from TB compared to the traditional observation methods. VDOT currently active in San Diego was recently expanded into San Francisco, New York and London. Understanding the impact of mobile technology on the treatment of TB also serves to underscore the critical necessity of investigating new ways to use mobile technology to improve the treatment for all types of chronic and infectious disease.\n\nMobile technology can not only improve medication adherence it can deliver disease education, send behavioral intervention reminders, increase access to specialty care via video and remotely monitor biometrics. Yet, the current use of mobile technology in health care systems is a fraction of its potential. That is why it is so essential that this promising success of TB adherence through mobile technology be widely communicated.\n\nBy demonstrating how this technology can provide a 21st century solution to an age old disease that is among the deadliest of pandemics, we can catalyze greater interest within health care systems for exploring new and powerful ways that mobile technology can improve care, reduce costs and save lives.\n\nRose Stuckey Kirk is Verizon's vice president of global corporate social responsibility and president of the Verizon Foundation.",

They\u2019d Instagram well and probably make my legs look nice. But my feet would be crying for a shoe with support \u2014 or worse!\n\nJust last week, supertrendy Madewell recalled more than 50,000 hipster sandals because a \u201cmetal shank\u201d was breaking through the base, causing people to trip and fall.\n\nMadewell\u2019s strappy numbers (above) are uncomfortable and potentially dangerous.Photo: Handout\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to wear the same sandals as a woman who has walked this Earth for more than eight decades? After all, she\u2019s probably on to something.\n\nMy Easy Spirit \u201cKanani\u201d dress sandals (originally $79, now on sale for $19.99), are not my first foray into what some would call \u201cgrandma sandals.\u201d I spent the summer of 2012 running around Washington, DC in footwear by another octogenarian brand favorite \u2014 the tan SAS \u201cDuo\u201d \u2014 at the urging of my mom to \u201cget a comfy pair of shoes.\u201d At first reluctant, I quickly fell in love as I outlasted my friends when standing in line for the Smithsonian.\n\nI once dared to ask a fashionable friend if they were \u201cthat bad.\u201d She responded with the cold, hard truth: \u201cYeah, they are.\u201d\n\nI rocked those sandals for a good two years before they met their demise. I once dared to ask a fashionable friend if they were \u201cthat bad.\u201d She responded with the cold, hard truth: \u201cYeah, they are.\u201d\n\nSo after moving to New York City, I decided to invest in something more \u201cfashion forward.\u201d\n\nI scouted women\u2019s sandals on the subway, trying not to look like a foot fetishist as I took stock of the styles and how comfortable the wearer looked.\n\nThen I tested the offerings at J.Crew and Madewell \u2014 each made from a sole of leather so thin, you\u2019d be better off walking on cardboard. Some of the styles I strapped on even ended up in the recent recall.\n\nI couldn\u2019t fight it anymore: My narrow feet needed the support of a cushy sole fit for Grandma Ellie \u2014 so I high-tailed it to the Easy Spirit store on the Upper West Side.\n\nBrowsing the selection, the white-haired women and I exchanged knowing glances like Taylor Swift and Cindy Crawford in the \u201cBad Blood\u201d music video: They knew I had caught on to their secret.\n\nEasy Spirit \u201cKanani\u201d sandals, $19.99, boast a classic design and extra cushioning.Photo: Handout\n\nThe \u201cKanani\u201d sandal had it all: a simple black design paired with the brand\u2019s \u201cTriflexa technology\u201d \u2014 three layers of cushioning with memory foam.\n\nIt\u2019s as perfect for my nights out on the Lower East Side as it is for Grandma Ellie\u2019s short walk to Curves for a workout. At first, I told myself I wouldn\u2019t reveal to my friends where I got my new shoes, but then the compliments started and I gave in. (Though no one has followed my lead \u2014 yet.)\n\nThanks to the athleisure trend \u2014 and designers like Marni and Rebecca Minkoff pushing out comfy, if overpriced, shoes \u2014 my sandals apparently sit pretty high on the fashion scale. However, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long until the trendy set switches to some foot-torture device that will have models hobbling down the runway.\n\nGrandma Ellie and I know they\u2019re sensible forever.",

One well-placed publishing source put the selling price at $4 million to $6 million, subject to final audit.\n\nA letter of intent was signed yesterday and, barring last-minute complications, the transfer of ownership of the 142-year-old New York company to the Nashville-based concern is expected in April.\n\nAlexander O. Burnham, Dodd's managing editor, said he hoped the arrangement would provide capital and access to Nelson's well regarded sales force of 25 employees. ''This way, we'll be able to compete more successfully for manuscripts in the highly competitive publishing business,'' he said.\n\nThe sale was reportedly sought by Dodd, Mead's three major family stockholders, Edward Dodd, Dr. Burwell Dodd and Winifred Rouillion, all of whom are in their 70's. There have been five generations of Dodds since the company's founding. Dodd, Mead's revenues are said to be slightly more than $4 million a year, much of it from a rich backlist that includes such authors as G.K. Chesterton, Leo Tolstoy, Max Beerbohm, William Rose Benet, Joseph Conrad, Sigmund Freud, Stephen Leacock and H.G. Wells.\n\nNelson, little known to the public, is considered a publishing phenomenon. Its president, Sam Moore, 50 years old, was born in Lebanon and went to South Carolina in 1950. He started selling Bibles and religious books door-to-door, and in 1969 he paid $2.6 million for the lagging American division of Thomas Nelson & Sons, a 170-year-old British-owned publisher.\n\nOne of only two publicly held biblical publishing houses in the United States, Nelson is a technically advanced company that makes wide use of computers and owns a leather bindery. Annual sales are $40 million, 80 percent from the sale of Bibles, which come in 500 styles and six major translations. Analysts have noted that Nelson is virtually ''recession-proof'' because sales of such books generally increase during periods of unemployment and economic uncertainty. 'Our Hope Is to Expand'\n\nNelson sells many books and periodicals to evangelical preachers and organizations. Two months ago, it was revealed that the company had secretly printed more than one million Bibles in Chinese for Open Doors, a missionary organization in Orange, Calif. Open Doors smuggled the Bibles into China this year.\n\nJoe Powers, vice president of Thomas Nelson, said Dodd, Mead would remain in New York: ''We do not intend to turn Dodd, Mead into a religious publisher. We want to diversify our operations, and its tasteful backlist fits well into what we would like to do. Our hope is to expand.''\n\nDodd, Mead began as a trade publisher when Moses W. Dodd, a Princeton graduate who had been kept from studying for the Presbyterian ministry because of weak eyes, started the company in order to publish sermons and other religious works. History, Music and Mystery\n\nOver the years, it has published Winston Churchill's ''The History of the English Speaking Peoples,'' and it became the publisher of the complete works of Shaw in the early 30's. It recently issued ''Shaw's Music,'' a $150 three-volume set of Shaw's music criticism, which was favorably reviewed on the front page of The New York Times Book Review.\n\nDodd, Mead has published all 88 books by Agatha Christie since 1926 and has published more than 200 books by Max Brand, the pen name of the late Frederick Faust. Several months ago, Dodd, Mead issued the widely reviewed ''The Jefferson Scandals'' by Virginius Dabney, a book disputing assertions that Jefferson kept a black mistress.\n\nS. Phelps Platt Jr., Dodd, Mead's president and chief executive officer since 1964, said of the arrangement, ''I think it's going to be a very successful acquisition because Nelson is anxious to become active in general trade publishing.'' Seed Money for Bible\n\nLast year, Dodd, Mead published 125 titles; Nelson had 111. Most of Nelson's output is religious books, but it has published more general books like ''Promised Land'' by Abba Eban and a book on Ireland by Leon Uris.\n\nIts major effort is the New King James Bible, an updated version of the 370-year-old King James Version, on which a team of more than 100 evangelical scholars, editors and church leaders has been working for six years. The New Testament portion is available, and Nelson will have exclusive rights to the entire Bible, for which it supplied seed money.",

            "answer": "Dodd, Mead, one of the last major privately held, family-owned book publishers in the United States and the longtime American publisher of George Bernard Shaw and Agatha Christie, will be acquired by Thomas Nelson Inc., the nation's largest publisher of Bibles. One well-placed publishing source put the selling price at $4 million to $6 million, subject to final audit.   A letter of intent was signed yesterday and, barring last-minute complications, the transfer of ownership of the 142-year-old New York company to the Nashville-based concern is expected in April.   Alexander O. Burnham, Dodd's managing editor, said he hoped the arrangement would provide capital and access to Nelson's well regarded sales force of 25 employees. ''This way, we'll be able to compete more successfully for manuscripts in the highly competitive publishing business,'' he said."

I have yet to try one of the recipes !\n\nThe prototype Coca-Cola recipe was formulated at the Eagle Drug and Chemical Company, a drugstore in Columbus, Georgia by John Pemberton, originally as a coca wine called Pemberton's French Wine Coca. He may have been inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani, a European coca wine. In 1886, when Atlanta and Fulton County passed prohibition legislation, Pemberton responded by developing Coca-Cola, essentially a non-alcoholic version of French Wine Coca. The first sales were at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. It was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains, which were popular in the United States at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health. Pemberton claimed Coca-Cola cured many diseases, including morphine addiction, dyspepsia, neurasthenia, headache, and impotence. Pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on May 29 of the same year in the Atlanta Journal. By 1888, three versions of Coca-Cola \u2014 sold by three separate businesses \u2014 were on the market. Asa Griggs Candler acquired a stake in Pemberton's company in 1887 and incorporated it as the Coca Cola Company in 1888. The same year, while suffering from an ongoing addiction to morphine, Pemberton sold the rights a second time to four more businessmen: J.C. Mayfield, A.O. Murphey, C.O. Mullahy and E.H. Bloodworth. Meanwhile, Pemberton's alcoholic son Charley Pemberton began selling his own version of the product. John Pemberton declared that the name \"Coca-Cola\" belonged to Charley, but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the formula. So, in the summer of 1888, Candler sold his beverage under the names Yum Yum and Koke. After both failed to catch on, Candler set out to establish a legal claim to Coca-Cola in late 1888, in order to force his two competitors out of the business. Candler purchased exclusive rights to the formula from John Pemberton, Margaret Dozier and Woolfolk Walker. However, in 1914, Dozier came forward to claim her signature on the bill of sale had been forged, and subsequent analysis has indicated John Pemberton's signature was most likely a forgery as well.\n\nCoca-Cola's advertising has significantly affected American culture, and it is frequently credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in a red-and-white suit. Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, the motif was already common. Coca-Cola was not even the first soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising: White Rock Beverages used Santa in advertisements for its ginger ale in 1923, after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915. Before Santa Claus, Coca-Cola relied on images of smartly dressed young women to sell its beverages. Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress Hilda Clark as its spokeswoman. 1941 saw the first use of the nickname \"Coke\" as an official trademark for the product, with a series of advertisements informing consumers that \"Coke means Coca-Cola\".In 1971 a song from a Coca-Cola commercial called \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\", produced by Billy Davis, became a hit single.\n\nI think it's time for the Pause that refreshes and if I could sing I just might buy the world a Coke!\n\nProduced, Hosted and Edited by: Percy von Lipinski",

A lawyer for OneUnited said church officials were to blame for their inability to repay Charles Street\u2019s loans, not the bank.\n\nA foreclosure auction had been scheduled for Thursday but was canceled.\n\nOneUnited lawyer Liam Vesely said church allegations that the bank had refused to work out the loan were unfair.\n\nVesely said OneUnited\u2019s principals, including chairman Kevin Cohee, had met with church officials at their request back in 2010, after the bank had sued the church over a separate, $3 million construction loan.\n\nVesely noted that Charles Street\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Gregory G. Groover, did not attend that meeting. (Church trustees and lawyers did.) He said a proposal to work on the loan had come out of the meeting but that no progress was made after that.\n\nThe bank\u2019s relationship with Charles Street started to sour around 2009, Vesely said. \u201cThe church became less cooperative with the bank,\u2019\u2019 he said, and would not supply requested financial documents. He said most of the church\u2019s loan payments over the years had been late.\n\nVesely also suggested that OneUnited was outraged by an offer in 2010 from a group of investors and philanthropists to buy out the construction loan at about 30 cents on the dollar. The bank, he said, \u201cgot blindsided\u2019\u2019 and was \u201cunderstandably taken aback.\u2019\u2019\n\nA lawyer representing the church\u2019s district organization, Chad Dale, sought to rebut the bank\u2019s charges. Dale pointed to OneUnited\u2019s own problems, noting that the bank is under a cease-and-desist order from bank regulators, due to poor lending standards and excessive pay.\n\nAfter more than an hour of hearing from both sides, federal Judge Frank Bailey called the fight an \u201cunfortunate dispute\u2019\u2019 and said the matter would be settled in his court. He said he could not imagine a case where \u201cwe couldn\u2019t be more collectively motivated\u2019\u2019 to ensure the survival of a debtor - in this case, a historic church.\n\nIn response to the judge\u2019s comment, Vesely said, \u201cThe bank\u2019s goal is absolutely not to put Charles Street AME out of business.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso in attendance at the hearing were lawyers for two other church creditors - Tremont Credit Union, which loaned it $450,000 for a new roof in 2009; and Thomas Construction Co., which is owed $629,000 for work on the church\u2019s community center.\n\nRoss Martin, a lawyer for the church, sought and received permission for Charles Street to continue paying for health insurance for church employees, and to pay $4,500 in wages.\n\nIt was disclosed that he church has about $15,000 in available cash.",

The statements were the first extensive comments by OneUnited in the months-long saga over a $1.1 million loan that the Charles St. AME owes the bank and which has sparked an unusually divisive battle between two of Boston\u2019s most prominent black institutions."

In the courts, such a request would go before a different judge. But in the world of accreditation, the commission itself - a quasi-private agency overseen by the U.S. Department of Education - decides whether it erred.\n\nThat process could take months. If the commission upholds its own decision, the college could appeal the revocation - also to the commission. That could also take months.\n\nSo far, the commission has not looked kindly upon City College.\n\nA year ago, it gave the college a March deadline to comply with a long list of accrediting standards dealing with governance, fiscal controls and assessing its own procedures.\n\nThen, after months of review, the commission issued a harsh assessment Wednesday, saying the college had satisfied only two of 14 recommendations and that the school would lose its accreditation on July 31, 2014.\n\nThe commission found that City College still suffers from financial management deficiencies, ineffective leadership and bickering employees.\n\n\"Within the college, some faculty feel strong pressure, even intimidation, to defer to designated faculty leaders even when they feel that a different approach should be considered,\" Barbara Beno, the commission's president, said in her letter announcing the decision.\n\nNor has the elected Board of Trustees become more effective, Beno said.\n\nOn Monday, Brice Harris, the state's community college chancellor, will ask the college system's Board of Governors for authorization to appoint a \"special trustee with extraordinary powers\" over City College - a czar who can unilaterally decide how to speed the college toward its goal of staying in business.\n\n\"The special trustee will be the eyes and ears of Chancellor Harris,\" said Paul Feist, Harris' spokesman. \"The chancellor is going to use everything in his power to keep City College open and to address the remaining deficiencies.\"\n\nOnce the czar is chosen - it will probably be Robert Agrella, who has served as the state's adviser to the college for nearly a year - the college trustees will no longer have decision-making power, though the seven-member panel may still meet.\n\nEven the trustees aren't sure what their role will be.\n\n\"If it's an advisory role, we want to provide that advice,\" said the panel's president, John Rizzo.\n\nMeanwhile, City College also has to beef up its closure plan. Officials prepared such a plan in March, as the accrediting commission required, but Beno said it \"did not provide sufficient detail to ensure orderly closure.\"\n\nThe report - intended to explain how City College would help tens of thousands of students in academic limbo, deal with thousands of suddenly jobless employees, disburse millions of dollars in assets and shutter dozens of academic departments - was just 10 pages long.\n\nNot all college advocates are going along with the commission's requirements.\n\nThe California Federation of Teachers Local 2121, which represents faculty members at City College, has filed a complaint about the commission with the Department of Education. The union said the commission engaged in conflicts of interest, such as including Beno's husband on a team of reviewers for City College, and said the panel is harsher than other regional accrediting commissions.\n\nAlso fighting back is the Save City College Coalition of students, employees and community members. Eric Blanc, a City College student, said protesters intend to march at 4 p.m. Tuesday from the downtown campus at Fourth and Mission streets to the Education Department's office on Beale Street.\n\n\"Given the egregious attacks on City College, we're calling on the Education Department to withdraw its recognition\" of the commission, Blanc said. \"Our plan is to make it clear that they need to immediately step in and reverse this action.\"\n\nNanette Asimov is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Goldin. Mr. Goldin said Sunday that a continuing and as yet unpublished audit of the authority had disclosed that it overcharged the city for insurance payments by more than $5 million and failed to notify the city of the excess charges.\n\nPeter C. Goldmark Jr., the executive director of the Port Authority, defended the need for the revised lease arrangement and dismissed the Comptroller's allegation about an overcharge by the authority. ''We don't think it's meritorious,'' Mr. Goldmark said. He added that he thought Mr. Goldin was creating unwarranted obstacles to an agreement.\n\nUnder the proposed agreement, the Port Authority would invest $500 million for runway renovation and the expansion of passenger terminals and air-cargo facilities at the two airports. In exchange, the city would receive about $1 million less in rent from the authority, according to Arthur Borut, a special assistant to the commissioner of the city's Office of Economic Development. The $500 million for the program would be paid partly by authority bonds and partly by the airlines that use the airports.\n\nWithout the new agreement, Mr. Goldmark said, there would be no new development at the two airports. ''Under the existing lease we have to charge such a phenomenal rate of interest as to preclude any new investment,'' he said.\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the two airports, has sought changes in its 1968 lease agreement with the city for the last two years. It maintains that it cannot finance the development of the two Queens airports without lease changes that would mean, at least initially, a reduction in the rent the authority pays.\n\nThe agreement, which requires the approval of the seven-member Board of Estimate, has drawn fire from several members, including the Mr. Goldin and City Council President Carol Bellamy.\n\nRobert A. Kandel, the Mayor's representative on the Board of Estimate, said that he would delay action on the agreement when it comes before the board at its meeting Thursday. ''We'll insist on a resolution of the $5 million question,'' he said. Citizens' Group Opposed\n\nBut Donald R. Manes, the Borough President of Queens, who expressed reservations about the terms of the agreement, said he would not impede passage of the agreement despite the stiff opposition of the Queens Citizens Organization.The community group has sought $150 million from the Port Authority to fix roads and sewers in neighborhoods around the airports.\n\nThe vote of Mr. Manes on the Board of Estimate is considered essential to passage of the revised lease. He said that while he believed that the Port Authority should help alleviate the deterioration of neighborhoods caused by the airports, the benefits of airport expansion outweighed other considerations.\n\nHowever, Mr. Goldin, who faces a stiff election challenge from Bronx Assemblyman John C. Dearie, said that the Port Authority must help defray the costs of rebuilding sewers and roads that would become overburdened by airport expansion.\n\n''There should be some effort by the Port Authority to do something for the areas around the airport which are adversely affected by it,'' said Walter Prawzinsky, the second deputy comptroller who is conducting the audit of the authority. ''The Borough President should give us a list of projects and the Port Authority would fund those projects.''",

He spoke at the Mississippi War Memorial Building, which had the inscription, \u201cRemember the dead too have voices.\u201d Mr. Cochran\u2019s surrogates pitched the incumbent senator\u2019s record to fellow former service members.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win this election tomorrow,\u201d said Roger Wicker, Mississippi\u2019s junior senator.\n\nMr. Cochran, returning to a theme he struck in an appearance in Biloxi on Sunday, promoted his foreign policy experience during the event with Mr. McCain.\n\n\u201cNot only the eyes of the nation, the eyes of the world will be on this election tomorrow,\u201d Mr. McCain said.\n\nOn Sunday, the two campaigns held dueling rallies less than 10 miles apart in Biloxi, appealing to the 40,000 veterans living along the coast. Fewer than 3,000 votes separated the two candidates in the June 3 primary.\n\nIn this beach town, where a veterans hospital, a veterans retirement community and an Air Force base sit alongside the casinos, Mr. Cochran and Mr. McDaniel tried to convince their crowds that they would be a better advocate for military families and shipbuilding jobs.\n\nRepresentative Steven M. Palazzo, a Republican who represents southern Mississippi, spoke in support of Mr. Cochran, lauding the incumbent\u2019s Navy service and saying it made military issues personal to him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fighter, but what do you expect \u2014 he\u2019s a veteran of our nation\u2019s military,\u201d Mr. Palazzo said.\n\nMr. Cochran, 76, had expected to be joined on Sunday by Mr. McCain, a fellow Navy veteran, but Mr. McCain encountered travel problems and was not able to make the event, at Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport.\n\nOne challenge for Mr. Cochran, who has been a senator since 1978, may be making people aware of his military experience. He served in the Navy for three years a half-century ago, and while veterans at Mr. Cochran\u2019s rally said his years in the armed forces had drawn them to him, some veterans at Mr. McDaniel\u2019s Tea Party Express rally here said they did not know that Mr. Cochran had served.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s event, Mr. McDaniel, 41, attacked Mr. Cochran\u2019s congressional record on military issues, criticizing him for supporting Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and for not doing enough to protect jobs at Ingalls Shipbuilding, which employs about 10,000 workers in nearby Pascagoula. Mr. McDaniel said the company had lost 14,000 jobs since Mr. Cochran took office.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather worked at Ingalls \u2014 we have a shipbuilding legacy in my family,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said. \u201cI know what it means to the coast. I know what it means to my area. And, by George, we\u2019re going to make it right again.\u201d\n\nSome of the veterans at Mr. McDaniel\u2019s rally said they supported him despite Mr. Cochran\u2019s service. Mr. McDaniel is stronger on issues that veterans care about, they said.\n\nLuther Miller, 72, who waved a \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag and served during the Vietnam War, talked about the Ingalls job losses. Paul Leideg, 54, who retired from the Air Force, said he saw Mr. McDaniel as more patriotic.\n\n\u201cThe patriotism that he\u2019s bringing with the Tea Party right now is what really is driving a lot of military to this side,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the area\u2019s military ties and the crises broiling in the Middle East, Mr. McDaniel did not delve very deep into foreign policy here.",

Tu Lan was shut down for a day or two at a time in January 2011, September 2011, April 2012 and on Friday.\n\nEach time, inspectors found different combinations of the same health violations, including live mice and cockroaches in the cooking areas, standing water in the kitchen, improper refrigeration and unsanitary food handling.\n\n\"They had eggs sitting out for three days, four days,\" Cushing said. Workers \"weren't washing their hands - they were scratching themselves and handling food.\"\n\nTu Lan is closed until it can show a clean enough kitchen to re-open, Cushing said. But given the high number of major violations in the past 18 months, the restaurant also faces a hearing where it could have its permit revoked, something Cushing called \"the last straw.\"\n\nThe restaurant's owner, Anthony Nguyen, will have to appear at the next health director's hearing on Aug. 8, where the director will decide whether to give the restaurant another chance to clean up or shut it down.\n\nCushing said the restaurant owners have told her inspectors that they provide a service by selling cheap eats to the cash-strapped people in the neighborhood.\n\n\"Sometimes (Nguyen) will say, 'We provide cheap food for people to eat,'\" Cushing said. \"But in this area of the street, we might have immuno-suppressed people who can't afford to get sick.\"\n\nCushing said that Tu Lan had complaints filed against it in the past, but that the frequency and seriousness of the violations have increased.

Puerto Rico rolled in around 7:30, waving the island's flag.\n\nThree Latino strangers were on a pilgrimage to get inside the confirmation hearings for Sonia Sotomayor. Watching on television wasn't an indelible enough experience for them. After passing the hours by exchanging life stories, they felt like friends -- so much in common with each other, so much in common with the self-made arc of Sotomayor's life.\n\n\"Our stories seem to be unique and yet they're not,\" said Ephraim Cruz, 36, a union organizer whose Puerto Rican mother raised seven children near Sotomayor's South Bronx, N.Y., neighborhood. He still lives not far away. \"People who are working every day, if they apply themselves, they can obtain a certain height.\"\n\n\"Her journey is my journey,\" said Lynette Oliver, 56, who runs a women's support group in Puerto Rico. She recalled slights from doctors who assumed she was just an underqualified affirmative action case during her medical studies at Michigan State. Oliver brought her hankie-size Puerto Rican flag because \"I want her to know people from the island are here.\"\n\nClaudine Martinez, the lawyer in pink, exchanged her sneakers and slacks for elegant wedge-heeled black sandals and a skirt to enter the hearing, all the while thinking of her father, Ted Martinez, a self-made businessman. Whenever Sotomayor credits her own mother's hard work and support, Claudine is reminded of Ted, who told her no one could take away her education. She was the first in the family to leave the ancestral ranch land of Trujillo, N.M., with few models for the new role she was undertaking -- just the simple, unwavering support of home. She remembers what she was doing when she heard President Obama had nominated Sotomayor.\n\n\"I nearly choked on my toothbrush,\" she said. \"I knew then I was going to be there. . . . It's much different when you are there to feel the energy.\" She held out her arm. \"It's electric. My hair is standing on end and I have goose bumps.\"\n\nNon-Latinos also joined the queue at the corner of First and C streets NE to obtain free green-bordered tickets to witness history unfold in Room 216 of the Hart Senate Office Building. Senate staffers escorted groups of 24 into the back of the hearing room for 20-minute stays. By early afternoon, more than 650 people had cycled through.\n\nThe Latinos in the room often found personal meaning in the proceedings, describing how just seeing Sotomayor is like seeing an idealized, more accomplished version of themselves. \"Being here is being part of a person we all admire,\" said Suleika Cabrera Drinane, a New Yorker who moved from Puerto Rico as a child.\n\nThose who couldn't journey to Washington found other ways to participate. At least 28 viewing parties were organized across the country, according to Latino legal activists. Latinos also held a demonstration in support of Sotomayor late yesterday afternoon near Union Station.\n\nTalking about Sotomayor led them back to their own stories. \"There are so few Latinos at the top of the legal profession,\" said Brigida Benitez, a partner at WilmerHale who hosted a viewing party for a dozen lawyers at her firm's downtown Washington offices. \"That's why it's so meaningful to me for her to be where she is,\" Benitez said, describing her upbringing north of Miami where few, including her parents, found opportunities to attend college.\n\nIn the ticket line, under the summer sun, Cruz, Martinez, Oliver and other new friends found a way to maximize the minutes in Sotomayor's presence. As soon as Senate staffers began handing out the tickets for the next time period, they would get back in line for another ticket. They accumulated several. Their goal was to be in the hearing room during the lucky time slot when Sotomayor would give her opening statement.\n\nFrances Marquez, an assistant professor of American government at Gallaudet University, introduced herself to the out-of-towners. At 41, she's a third-generation Mexican American whose father and grandfather were farmers in California. Her parents raised six children who each graduated from college and, among them, earned seven advanced degrees. \"Young Latinos will see her and know anything is possible,\" Marquez said.",

The average equity fund followed by Arthur Lipper & Company, which monitors mutual fund performance, fell 4.24 percent between Jan.1 and Oct.22 this year - with all distributions presumed reinvested.\n\nThat's better than the market as a whole. The Standard & Poor index of 500 stocks dropped 11.87 percent for the same period. Nevertheless, the relatively good performance of Lipper's 332 equity funds is cold comfort to investors, who could have been earning high returns in the money market.\n\nAshland Management Inc. has used the money market for its clients. The New York City-based money manager has $70 million in hand.\n\nThe philosophy guiding the fund's managers, like that of most other money managers, is to promote growth of underlying assets. But Ashland's principals do not use the stock market for this purpose when they find conditions hostile.\n\nCurrently, Ashland's money is 100 percent in Treasury bills. Other professional money managers have abandoned the stock market from time to time in the past, and most replace some stocks with cash equivalents during bear markets.\n\nBut Ashland may be unique in holding only cash equivalents for over a year, having been in Treasury bills and other money market instruments since the beginning of October 1980.\n\nComparing Ashland's results with those of mutual funds, gains have averaged about 13 percent per account so far this year. Parry von Steinwehr Jones, Ashland's president, explained the strategy: ''In September 1980 we determined that the stock market was overvalued and that short-term money market instruments offered an attractive alternative.''\n\nUnder the firm's overall investment philosophy, it will not buy stocks unless appreciation potential compensates for the risks involved.\n\n''We feel that unless an investor has reasonable expectations of earning at least 50 percent more in stocks than on 90-day certificates of deposit, he should stay in these alternative investments. Ashland is being even more cautious than that today and is earning approximately 13.5 percent in one-month Treasury bills.''\n\nObviously, many money managers differ with this philosophy and are currently holding mostly shares.\n\nAshland has many accounts, and each is tailored to the client's needs. But Ashland thinks it notable that money managed for its clients has appreciated in every month over the past two years. Moreover, during that period growth accounts have increased in value by more than 70 percent, Mr. Jones stated.\n\nBasic to Ashland's approach is reliance on reported data. Ashland believes that projections are too unreliable to be used in making investment decisions.\n\n''We look for a strong balance sheet, above average return on equity and a positive earnings trend. When a stock no longer meets our criteria, we rapidly sell it,'' Mr. Jones said.\n\nHe added that Ashland still felt that the stock market as a whole was overvalued and that the opportunity of obtaining significant capital appreciation was limited.\n\nMeantime, Ashland follows 800 stocks and has 30 on its list of candidates. It will not buy, though, unless relative returns improve. The list changes with financial factors and stock prices, of course.\n\nMr. Jones offered six companies whose shares are currently in the buying range for those who want to be in the market, despite what he believes to be a negative case for that strategy.\n\nHe mentioned the Allied Corporation, formerly Allied Chemical; the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, the food processor; the LTV Corporation, a steel, shipping, oil field equipment and aerospace conglomerate; H.H. Robertson & Company, an international construction company; Teledyne Inc., the industrial company with an actively managed investment portfolio, and the Todd Shipyards Corporation.\n\nCommenting that these shares were 'undervalued'' he added: ''Maybe some of these stocks will shoot out the lights, but we'd still prefer to be in money market instruments.''\n\nAshland charges a 1 percent management fee, with a minimum fee of $2,500 a year.

The average equity fund followed by Arthur Lipper & Company, which monitors mutual fund performance, fell 4.24 percent between Jan.1 and Oct.22 this year - with all distributions presumed reinvested.   That's better than the market as a whole. The Standard & Poor index of 500 stocks dropped 11.87 percent for the same period.

They decided to perpetrate a wholesale massacre by bombing the Semiramis hotel in the Katamon section of Jerusalem, in order to drive out the Palestinians from Jerusalem. The massacre of the Semiramis Hotel on January 5, 1948, was the direct responsibility of Jewish Agency leader David Ben-Gurion and Haganah leaders Moshe Sneh and Yisrael Galili. If this massacre had taken place in World War II, they would have been sentenced to death for their criminal responsibility along with the terrorists who placed the explosives. A description of the massacre of the Semiramis Hotel from the United Nations Documents follows, as well as the Palestine Police report on the crime sent to the Colonial Office in London: 5 January 1948. Haganah terrorists made a most barbarous attack at one o'clock in the early morning of Monday, 5 January 1948, at the Semiramis Hotel in the Katamon section of Jerusalem, killing innocent people and wounding many. The Jewish Agency terrorist forces blasted the entrance to the hotel by a small bomb and then placed bombs in the basement of the building. As a result of the explosion the whole building collapsed with its residents. As the terrorists withdrew, they started shooting at the houses in the neighborhood. Those killed were: Subhi El-Taher, Moslem; Mary Masoud, Christian; Georgette Khoury, Christian; Abbas Awadin, Moslem; Nazira Lorenzo, Christian; Mary Lorenzo, Christian; Mohammed Saleh Ahmed, Moslem; Ashur Abed El Razik Juma, Moslem; Ismail Abed El Aziz, Moslem; Ambeer Lorenzo, Christian; Raof Lorenzo, Christian; Abu Suwan Christian family, seven members, husband, wife and five children.

They are bringing in more money and living longer compared to others in the state of Caifornia.\n\nAccording to the state Franchise Tax Board, Marin County topped the charts in terms of highest median income for joint tax returns ($120,170) as well as individual returns ($52,032) for the tax year 2011. This was the second year in a row that Marin County took the top spot. Not far behind were two other Bay Area counties. Home to many tech workers, Santa Clara ranked second ($103,019 joint return median) and San Mateo County took the third spot. ($102,793 joint return median).\n\nMarin residents are healthiest and have the highest income in the state\n\nIn addition to bringing home more income, Marinites were also found to be the healthiest residents in the state, in a yearly survey conducted by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. They also lived longer than folks in other counties. Accordiing to the The MarinIJ, the study looked at five criteria:\n\n\u2022 The rate of people dying before age 75.\n\n\u2022 The percentage of people who reported being in fair or poor health.\n\n\u2022 The number of days people reported being in poor physical health over the last 30 days.\n\n\u2022 The number of days people reported being in poor mental health.\n\n\u2022 The rate of low-birth weight infants.\n\nIn Marin, 4,004 residents per 100,000 of the population died before the age of 75. This was almost 35% lower than the state average of 6,126 per 100,000. Despite the longevity, the MarinIJ does point out that binge drinking is an issue for the county.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the percentage of Marin residents who told the pollsters they had engaged in binge drinking within the past 30 days \u2014 24 percent \u2014 exceeded the state average of 17 percent and the national benchmark of 8 percent. The survey defines binge drinking as consuming more than four alcoholic beverages on a single occasion, if you\u2019re a women, and five drinks if you\u2019re a man.\n\nThe report suggests that Marin being an affluent community, alcohol availability and use is easier to come by and thus can contribute to the higher rates of binge drinking.",

Or maybe the Willem de Kooning: Like those more recent heroes of unbridled, virtuosic, intuitive creativity, he seems to have worked best (or at least, surprisingly well) when drunk.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts owns more than 50 of his paintings. This one, \u201cDragon and Clouds,\u201d is a perennial favorite, and for good reason. Painted when the artist was 34, it\u2019s one of those jaw-dropping, brow-mopping masterpieces that causes crowds to congregate.\n\nFull of graphic stylizations and painterly flourish, it shows a demented-looking dragon, its scaly body and tail partially veiled by darkness and clouds (clouds that could easily be confused with waves).\n\nMore than a million people saw it when it went to Japan last year with a show of Japanese masterpieces from the MFA\u2019s celebrated collection. It\u2019s now back in Boston. And, unlike the vast majority of its traveling companions, which are back in storage, it\u2019s once again on display.\n\nThirty-five feet in length, it comprises eight connected panels, and was originally part of a slightly larger suite of paintings that adorned the interior of a Buddhist temple hall. (The section with the tail and the section with the head may well have graced opposite walls.)\n\nTo get the painting ready for its Japanese tour, conservators at the MFA \u2014 which has its own department of Asian conservation and a great and longstanding tradition of expert restorations \u2014 separated the eight panels, repairing damage and discoloration. They then mounted the separate paintings on specially prepared wooden lattice cores cushioned on both sides by several layers of handmade Japanese paper.\n\nThe process, which took years to complete, ended when the paintings were given a lacquer wooden trim.\n\nOne discovery the conservators made was that repaired sections of \u201cDragon and Clouds\u201d had likely been taken from damaged sections of another Shohaku painting in the MFA\u2019s collection, \u201cHawk.\u201d\n\nThat spell-binding and richly detailed work, which was originally part of a larger composition, has been hung in the same room as \u201cDragon and Clouds,\u201d with two other Shohaku works.\n\nThe exhibition marks the 55th anniversary of the sister city relationship between Boston and Kyoto, the city in which Shohaku grew up. Kyoto was Japan\u2019s most vital artistic breeding ground. For four or five years he studied there with Takada Keiho, who passed on an obsession with monochrome and with the Zen tradition of the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nKeiho\u2019s influence left its mark, but Shohaku \u2014 despite his reputation for \u201cindolence\u201d and bohemian living \u2014 was also a busy innovator. An 1831 index of Japanese painters described him as a \u201cschool unto himself.\u201d\n\nHe adopted the name Soga because he wanted to associate himself with an obscure school established by the 15th-century Zen monk Soga Dasoku. By Shohaku\u2019s day, that school was moribund. Shohaku \u2014 he had his reasons \u2014 relished the association.",

He made the decision to leave the NFL after consulting with medical professionals and former players and doing extensive research.\n\nGiven their Stanford educations, the soon-to-be-drafted Cardinal players could share some similarities with the former inside linebacker. However, each of the four players interviewed made it clear he is eager to enter the league Borland just decided to preemptively exit.\n\nOf course, it should be noted that no player \u2014 particularly an eager-to-impress draft prospect \u2014 is likely to publicly acknowledge that he might consider following Borland\u2019s path.\n\n\u201cAs a college player, you know what you\u2019re doing to your body and the long-term effects of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d defensive end Henry Anderson said. \u201cYou know that going into it. \u2026 I know that down the road you can have some side effects from playing football, but I love the game. I\u2019m not going to ever stop playing until I have to.\u201d\n\nSaid safety Jordan Richards: \u201cIf he felt that he was in danger, I\u2019ve got to respect a man for that decision. It\u2019s his body. He\u2019s got to live the rest of his life, too. I love playing this game, but it\u2019s not worth dying for, but if I\u2019m healthy and I feel like I\u2019m good to go, I\u2019m going to play it as long as I can.\u201d\n\nAnd inside linebacker A.J. Tarpley: \u201cI respect his decision, but right now, I\u2019m full-go with football.\u201d\n\nFor his part, 49ers outside linebacker Chase Thomas, who also attended Stanford, was ready to put his education to work in May. After his first season in the NFL, the communications major was considering a career in commercial real estate and was polishing his resume.\n\nHis motivation, however, differed from that of Borland: Thomas was waived three times in the first 15 months of his career and wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d get another shot to play in the NFL. Another opportunity arrived when the 49ers signed him, and Thomas plans to keep playing until he runs out of chances.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really say anything bad about it,\u201d Thomas said of Borland\u2019s decision. \u201cEach guy does what he thinks is right.\u201d\n\nStanford head coach David Shaw said players are discussing health-related issues, but those conversations have been happening for years. Shaw doesn\u2019t believe Borland\u2019s retirement will inspire a significant change in the sport.\n\n\u201cFor a guy to say, 'I don\u2019t want to play anymore for physical reasons,\u2019 I shake their hand and pat them on the back,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBut make no mistake about it: There\u2019s going to be 30 guys lined up for that spot.\u201d\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Their bankers aren\u2019t happy about it.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is demanding records from the banks and is buying anonymous information about at least 10 million consumers from companies including Experian.\n\nWhile the goal is to sharpen enforcement and rule-making, banking executives question why the bureau is collecting so much without being more specific about the benefits.\n\n\u2018\u2018Do they need the reams and reams and reams of data we\u2019re having to provide to them?\u2019\u2019 Susan Faulkner, senior vice president at Bank of America, asked in March. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t we have to find a healthier balance here?\u2019\u2019\n\nDirector Richard Cordray has said that the bureau needs raw material to make \u2018\u2018data-driven\u2019\u2019 decisions based on how financial products and services are used or abused. Research will improve regulation and the marketplace, he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018The more information there is, the more innovation there can be and the more competition there is among the institutions around customer service,\u2019\u2019 Cordray told consumer groups last year.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s approach is part of a trend toward using data analytics, often dubbed Big Data, by Amazon.com, Google, IBM, General Electric, and others. They are mining massive pools of information for insight into areas including consumer behavior, manufacturing, and genetics.\n\nThe consumer bureau consolidates and expands US oversight of consumer finance. It supervises banks with assets over $10 billion as well as payday lenders, mortgage originators, debt collectors, and credit bureaus.\n\nThe law bars the agency from collecting data \u2018\u2018for purposes of gathering or analyzing the personally identifiable financial information of consumers.\u2019\u2019\n\nSendhil Mullainathan, the bureau\u2019s assistant director for research, said it is committed to protecting privacy and doesn\u2019t collect personal data such as Social Security numbers.\n\nBureau researchers are assembling data from across the financial landscape, according to a review of government records. Credit-card information from nine banks will be stored and analyzed by Argus Information & Advisory Services, a consultancy that won a $15 million contract for the work, procurement documents show. The documents don\u2019t name the nine banks.\n\nBanks are also being ordered to provide records of credit-card add-on products, including credit monitoring and debt cancellation, said two people briefed on the matter. Last year, the bureau persuaded banks to submit data on checking-account overdrafts.\n\nThe bureau is buying other records from outside the banking industry. Experian, the credit-monitoring company, will be paid up to $8.4 million to provide data on 5 million to 10 million consumers \u2018\u2018for use in a wide range of policy research projects,\u2019\u2019 according to contract documents. The bureau will also buy auto-loan information from Experian.\n\nClarity Services Inc., a credit reporting agency, will get $443,260 for providing data on short-term credit known as payday loans.\n\nTogether with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the consumer bureau is also building a mortgage database that will integrate consumer credit information with loan and property records. CoreLogic Inc. will be paid $796,000 for loan-level data on mortgages.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s credible to say that within the next year, CFPB will be the best place for consumer finance data,\u2019\u2019 said Mullainathan, who is also a professor of economics at Harvard.",

Lee alleges he was the victim of illegal government leaks to the media and has filed a lawsuit saying his reputation was ruined by disclosures of the investigation.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that although journalists have a qualified privilege to protect anonymous sources, it was outweighed by two key factors in Lee's case: The reporters had information central to his lawsuit, and Lee's attorneys had sufficiently exhausted their efforts to find the alleged leakers by interviewing government officials.\n\nInformation about the alleged leakers \"goes to the heart\" of the lawsuit Lee has filed under the Privacy Act, the court said. \"If he cannot show the identities of the leakers, Lee's ability to show the other elements of the Privacy Act claim, such as willfulness and intent, will be compromised.\"\n\nThe decision came the day after the Supreme Court rejected appeals from two reporters in another case. Judith Miller of the New York Times and Matt Cooper of Time magazine face going to jail or revealing their sources to a special prosecutor.\n\nThe back-to-back decisions against journalists' use of confidential sources have alarmed press advocates and First Amendment specialists.\n\n\"A really bad week for reporters,\" said Lucy Dalglish of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. \"Journalists need to know that when they promise confidentiality now, they may be making the most serious decision in their life.\"\n\nAly Colon, who teaches journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank in St. Petersburg, Fla., said: \"Any reporter who offers confidentiality needs to consider that jail is a real possibility now.\"\n\nMiller and Cooper face surrendering in coming weeks for a stint in jail that could last 18 months. Many experts believe the only way they could avoid incarceration is to comply with a court order to identify sources to a grand jury investigating whether government officials illegally leaked to the media the identity of a covert CIA operative in 2003. A judge will consider their punishment today.\n\nThe reporters in the Lee case are H. Josef Hebert of the Associated Press, James Risen of the New York Times, Robert Drogin of the Los Angeles Times, and Pierre Thomas, formerly of CNN and now at ABC. They face fines of $500 a day. The court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to hold in contempt a fifth journalist, New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth.\n\nThe Associated Press said it would seek a review of the decision by the full nine-member appeals court.\n\nLee was indicted on 59 counts alleging he mishandled nuclear weapons data and eventually pleaded guilty to one count. In his lawsuit, he alleges that leaks about the investigation harmed his reputation.\n\nAfter the ruling, Lee Levine, lawyer for Hebert and Drogin, said he feels a duty to warn journalist clients that they face a qualitatively different risk when they agree to take information in exchange for keeping sources anonymous.\n\n\"It's the latest example in a long string of examples now of courts in this country casting substantial doubt upon something reporters and their lawyers thought was settled long ago -- that reporters have the ability to make and keep promises to their sources,\" Levine said.\n\nCharles Tobin, who represented Thomas, agreed. He said all reporters may want to consider discussing with sources the possibility that they would be subpoenaed.",

But the sessions were rare occasions in that each of the networks opened itself to public, occasionally critical, self-examination before its two major competitors and those who are hired by candidates to manipulate television coverage.\n\nDiscussions ranged across a variety of topics, from the networks' ability to control a candidate's access to the electorate, to the strategists' ability to use the fast-moving format of television news to create an image for a candidate.\n\nAt one point, the dialogue resembled a political strategy session for the Democrats. David Garth, the New York political consultant, said the party could benefit from a hard-hitting attack on President Reagan sure to fit neatly into network news broadcasts. David Gergen, the President's assistant for communications, responded that instead the Democrats should ''sit back and the media will do it for them.''\n\nThe political strategists engaged in little self-criticism. Gerald Rafshoon, who directed President Carter's 1980 television strategy, said that the strategist's role was simply ''to bring the issues into sharper focus, and point out differences between candidates.''\n\nBut Robert MacNeil, executive editor of the MacNeil-Lehrer Report on PBS, complained that ''the manipulators got away with tremendous oversimplification of their roles.''\n\nSome of the harsher criticisms of television came from one of its own. Roger Mudd, the chief Washington correspondent of NBC News, complained of a growing conflict for televi si on correspondents ''between being an honest reporter and being a member of show business.''\n\n''Over the last 15 years, as competition has sharpened between the networks, none of us is content to let an event be an event,'' Mr. Mudd told the conferees yesterday. ''We have to fix it. We have to foreshorten the conclusions, hasten the end, predict before anyone else does who's going to win. We have to take an issue on our own terms, and we won't let the candidate lay out the issues on his terms.'' As a result, he added, the craft of television news is ''less honorable'' than it was 10 years ago. Supported Time Rule\n\nMr. Mudd was also the only representative of a network to say that he did not favor the repeal of Section 315 of the Federal Communications Code, which requires television stations to grant equal time to all candidates who have met certain Federal standards. If the rule were repealed, he contended, ''the networks would concentrate on the leading two candidates, and others would never appear on the air.''\n\nBut nearly all of the network executives disagreed. ''The practical effect of a law that says that everyone gets on,'' William Leonard, president of CBS News, said this morning, ''is that nobody gets on.''\n\nMr. Leonard also defended the use of projections to predict the outcome of elections, sometimes several hours before the polls close on the West Coast. But at the conclusion of the conference, he suggested that the networks would do well to redirect much of the approximately $15 million that each spends on convention and election night coverage ''to put a greater emphasis on the coverage of issues and the primaries.'' Covering the 'Issues'\n\nThe political strategists and scholars were particularly critical of the networks' perceived failure to examine ''issues,'' itself a source of som e definitional debate. Television executives expressed hopes that if the Federal Communications Commission allows the networks to e xpand evening news programs to one hour, the result willbe more in-de pth analysis.\n\nHowever, Mr. Gergen expressed concern that ''60 minutes would just be twice as much of what we have now,'' a reference to the increasing trend toward news stories limited to one to two minutes. Earlier in the session Tom Brokaw, an NBC correspondent, said that correspondents were ''tempted to be very judgmental at the end of that one minute.''\n\nMr. MacNeil added that such brief stories underlined the shallowness of television news coverage. ''In the anxiety to keep the maximum audience,'' he said, ''a lot of effort goes into retaining the attention of the uninterested.''\n\nIllustrations: Photo of David Garth",

In the three-day conference at the Institute of Politics, the participants were not able to agree on significant ways to change television coverage of the nominating and election process. But the sessions were rare occasions in that each of the networks opened itself to public, occasionally critical, self-examination before its two major competitors and those who are hired by candidates to manipulate television coverage.   Discussions ranged across a variety of topics, from the networks' ability to control a candidate's access to the electorate, to the strategists' ability to use the fast-moving format of television news to create an image for a candidate."

We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\"\n\nThe thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air.\n\nMusic resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n\nOther performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour.\n\nArcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.\n\nBravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.\n\nThey  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs.\n\nAs well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.\n\nFrontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance.\n\nThe set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).\n\nThe group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.\n\nPlus, they have really catchy choruses.\n\nThe band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.\n\nAs the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage.\n\n\"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\"\n\nThe feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday.\n\n\"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a nice vibe. There's lots of families.\n\n\"It's not just about massive headlining acts. And it's not going to be a swamp of corporate beer-swilling drunkards.\n\n\"There's rain and there's mud but it's new and it doesn't smell bad yet. It's like, 'oh, this mud smells like grass! It's spring!'\"\n\nThe music continues on Saturday with Jake Bugg, Pixies, Clean Bandit and Manic Street Preachers on the bill.\n\nAmong those watching the action will be Hollywood star Bradley Cooper, who told the BBC: \"I'm excited to see Metallica and I want to see Jack White and Lana Del Rey.\"\n\nAsked if he was put off by the weather, the Hangover star replied: \"I love it. I do! But I'm a dumb American - you expect it.\"\n\nGlastonbury 2014",

They are so proud of themselves,\" said Wood, a reading teacher at Phyllis E. Williams Elementary in Upper Marlboro. \"You can't put a price on that expression.\"\n\nBut at an annual cost of $4.5 million, the school system has decided it must end the program for first-graders who struggle with reading.\n\nThe Prince George's school system is facing a $155 milllion gap in its $1.6 billion budget. That has led schools Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. to propose the most severe cuts in his three-year tenure.\n\nAmong many other cuts, Hite has proposed eliminating 259 jobs by increasing class sizes, which would save $20 million, and eliminating 233 positions for the pre-kindergarten program, which would be reduced to a half-day program, saving $10 million. He also proposes to close the William S. Schmidt Outdoor Education Center, known as Camp Schmidt, where fifth-graders have learned about the outdoors for four decades.\n\nSchool board members say budget cuts are particularly painful this year because the system has relied for the past two years on federal stimulus money that has ended.\n\nThe likely closing of Camp Schmidt, in the Brandywine area, doesn't sit well with Laura Espinal, a fourth-grader at Calverton Elementary who praised the program's \"eco-friendly\" approach.\n\n\"The bluebird house would close and the bluebirds will lose their homes,\" she said at a Feb. 10 budget hearing.\n\nSchool board members will vote on the budget Thursday, which will be the last chance for the public's input. But while Hite and the school board members are expected to hear more pleas to retain programs, they say there is not much that they can do.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we still have a $155 million budget gap to close,\" Hite said in an interview. \"We have already identified $70 million in cuts. Now we are trying to identify $85 million in cuts. We have heard the public respond to some of the proposals that we have. It doesn't change the whole amount, but it changes how we are doing the reductions.\"\n\nDuring the Feb. 10 hearing, the Board of Education's chambers were packed with students. \"If children really do come first and you abide by that, then you won't take JROTC out of the budget and away from me and my fellow cadets,\" said Quishaun Gaines, 17, an Air Force JROTC cadet at Flowers High School in Springdale.\n\nLittle more than a week later, Hite told board members during a work session that the school system would be able to keep JROTC by eliminating one or two positions at each of the county high schools that have programs. But that was an exception, and one unlikely to be repeated. Hite said there would be no saving Camp Schmidt.\n\nCellestine Cheeks, associate professor of library science at Towson State University, said she applauds the school board for trying to be fiscally responsible. But she said that eliminating media specialist jobs will hurt the school libraries.\n\n\"There is no more important area in the school than the school library,\" Cheeks said. \"Without the school library, many children will not have access to 21st-century technology.\"\n\nPhelecia Nemdhard, president of the PTA at Lamont Elementary School in New Carollton, testified on behalf of the guidance counselor at her daughter's school. After 40 years in the school system, the counselor is scheduled to be laid off.\n\n\"We have to support programs that really help our children stay in school,\" Nemdhard said. \"Guidance counselors, ROTC, reading teachers are all programs that our children need.\"\n\nWhile the reading program for struggling first-graders is expected to be cut, school board member Edward Burroughs III (District 8) said it makes more sense to teach children how to read now than to place them in special education later.\n\n\"Shall we pay now or shall we pay later?\" he asked.",

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.\n\n\"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.\"\n\nAmong the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.\n\nRussia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov.\n\nPanellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.\n\nUnder the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.\n\nCampaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit.\"\n\nRobert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: \"The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.\n\n\"What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions\".",

''We hope to know what happened in a couple of days,'' he said. He added that there appeared to be no fundamental problems with the company's transmission and distribution systems.\n\nThe trouble arose between 6:35 and 7:05 P.M., when 10 feeder cables in Westchester County carrying purchased power from upstate New York went dead, depriving the system of 1,400 of the 5,000 megawatts being used at the time. The utility had said Thursday night that only 900 megawatts, or 18 percent of the load, had been lost.\n\nMr. Gitten said investigators had found a ''probable cause'' for the loss of two of the 10 overhead lines, all in the area of the Sprain Brook, Eastview, Buchanan and Dunwoodie substations. He said a wire serving as a lightning rod had, for unknown reasons, fallen onto and short-circuited one cable, which, in turn, may have tripped off another.\n\n''This would have accounted for some of the problems, but not all of them,'' Mr. Gitten said. He said investigators were examining and testing the feeder lines, as well as transformers and other equipment in substations and towers along the transmission route, in an effort to reconstruct what had happened. All 10 lines were restored to service by 6 A.M. Friday.\n\nConfronted with the loss of power, operators in a control center on West End Avenue in Manhattan averted a blackout by pressing buttons that increased the power being generated in the city from 2,100 to 3,900 megawatts, raised power imports from New Jersey from 400 to 1,400 megawatts and cut voltage systemwide by 8 percent for one hour to slightly increase the margin of safety.",

Enter your email below to start receiving ForbesWoman news and updates.\n\nWhen I decided to get married, I didn't worry at all about flowers, favors or cake. Generously, my husband's large and talented family provided all of these for us.\n\nInstead, my big worry, the one that kept me up for many, many nights, was what to do about my last name.\n\nAfter months of questioning my own feminism, hypotheticals involving hyphenation (what if we did, and our children married other hyphenated offspring?) and a fruitless inquiry into whether my husband had any interest in my surname (why should he, he asked, when he was so much closer to his father than I was to mine?), I decided to use my husband's name instead of mine.\n\nLegally, that is. Professionally, I still use my maiden name.\n\nIt wasn't an easy choice. In fact, 13 years later, I'm still almost as conflicted as many women are before they make the choice.\n\nMy own friends have found all sorts of solutions. Many kept their maiden names as their legal names. And for the most part, they never looked back. One though, bucked the trend by adding on her husband's surname.\n\nA Canadian acquaintance stood by as her government automatically changed her last name to her husband's when they were married in the 1980s, but then took the trouble to change it back, without divorce, 11 years later.\n\nOthers legally took their husband's names, but continued to go by their maiden noms, either as middle names or surnames, for professional reasons. \"My stage name,\" one friend jokes.\n\nOne male friend shuffled his last name to the middle and took on his wife's surname.\n\nI decided to drop my maiden surname, legally at least, because I believed that keeping it would peel back only one generation of women surrendering their names to men. My mother, after all, had taken my father's name.\n\nInstead, when we married, I took my husband's name while also adding the first name of a female ancestor, Indiana, into the middle of both my professional and legal names. I knew little about her except that she was a self-published poet and one of the founding inhabitants of Cambria, Calif. As a salute to my family, my husband added her name as a middle name too.\n\nIt's worked fairly well, and I like sharing my children's last name.\n\nThe only problem is, I now have two identities. This is great for separating my work life from my family life, but not much else.\n\nHere's how it looks: Professionally, I use my middle name and my maiden surname. For traveling, paying bills and being my kids' mother, I use my married name. For paying taxes, I use both. And because I receive checks made out to my work name, I've added it to my personal checking account.\n\nYes, it makes me dizzy too.\n\nNow comes the fun part: My e-mail signature is my professional name. Since it seems Sybilesque to use a separate e-mail account with my married name for personal correspondence, and because I do a lot of e-mailing for work, it all goes out under my work name. After much back-and-forth, I decided to use my maiden name for my Facebook account too.\n\nNow that technology has pushed my work name into my private life, my legal name has become almost an alias, something for dodging telemarketers and keeping my family's life private.\n\nAs my maiden name continues to take over, I find myself wondering, lo these many years later, if it might have made more sense to pick just one name--and stick with it.\n\nAs it is, when I'm asked to supply my name, I often do a double take. Which one does the school secretary know me by? And what do you mean you can't find my turkey order?\n\nIn other words, if you're headed down this path, I have no wisdom, aside from experience, to offer. If you crave simplicity, though, one identity is probably enough.",

His concern for the news and how it was covered made all of us who worked with him better at what we did.\"\n\nHe enjoyed discovering and hiring talented youngsters, many straight from their college newspapers. He was generous with praise and gentle with criticism. He always allowed a reporter to make changes in a story himself -- after patiently explaining why the change needed to be made.\n\n\"The most fun he had was cultivating young reporters,\" said his friend, Chronicle copy editor Bill Pates. \"He also really enjoyed his days as assistant city editor, where he was able to work on copy and deal with the Sacramento bureau.\"\n\nA native of Baltimore and a graduate of Loyola College in Baltimore, Mr. Gavin was a sports reporter and columnist at the Baltimore News American before coming to The Chronicle in 1969.\n\nFor many years he served as night city editor, directing the coverage of late-breaking stories and long features. In between, he managed to find time to attend countless theater productions and San Francisco Giants games. He admired a well-turned double play, a well-sung showstopper and a well-mixed Manhattan.\n\nHis tenure at The Chronicle was not without controversy. Before leaving the paper in 1977, he was criticized for his decisions related to the coverage of Peoples Temple leader Jim Jones. The Jonestown tragedy happened the following year.\n\nMr. Gavin returned briefly to the now-defunct Baltimore News American before joining the staff of the (Cherry Hill, N.J.) Courier-Post, where he was known as \"Big Steve.\" He served as city editor, columnist and editorial writer for nearly 25 years before retiring in 2003.\n\n\"He was so passionate about good writing,\" said Courier-Post columnist Kevin Riordan, whom Mr. Gavin hired as a cub reporter in 1980. \"Sports writing, editorials, nonfiction, fiction -- if it was good, he was passionate about it. He certainly helped me tremendously. I do a lot of things automatically that I learned from him, and I owe him a lot.\"\n\nOn his desk, said Riordan, he keeps a three-word note of writing advice (\"watch your 'whiches' \") that Mr. Gavin wrote to him a quarter century ago.\n\nIn his spare time, Mr. Gavin hopped the train to New York to attend countless Broadway plays and musicals. He was a regular at Baltimore Orioles games, although he often attended them wearing his old San Francisco Giants cap. He read any newspaper he could get his hands on.\n\nHe is survived by his longtime partner, Ichan Ando of Burlington, N.J., by sisters Patricia Gavin of Bel Air, Md., and Valerie Vogt of Lancaster, Pa., and by brother Gerald Gavin, of Baltimore.\n\nAt Mr. Gavin's request, no service will be held.",

Most businesses are required to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance, which covers the medical treatment, rehabilitation, and lost wages of employees injured on the job.\n\nIf approved, the rates would go into effect in September.\n\nThe substantial increase is necessary, the bureau said, because the cost of claims continues to rise, but the state has denied smaller requests in three of the past four years. The Division of Insurance rejected proposed increases of 2.3 percent increase in 2008, 4.5 percent increase in 2010, and a 6.6 percent increase in 2011.\n\n\u201cIf these three small increases in rates had been granted by the Commonwealth,\u2019\u2019 said Paul Meagher, president of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau of Massachusetts, \u201cwe would not need such a significant rate increase now.\u2019\u2019\n\nRichard C. Lord, president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state\u2019s largest employers\u2019 group, said yesterday in a blog post that the rate request deserves consideration. He said he is concerned that without an increase, fewer companies will offer the insurance, making it harder for businesses to buy policies.\n\n\u201cPrivate-market coverage is harder to come by because the economics of workers compensation no longer add up for insurers,\u2019\u2019 Lord wrote. \u201cThe growing disconnect between costs and premiums has already prompted several insurance companies to scale back their activity in Massachusetts.\u2019\u2019\n\nMassachusetts once had some of the highest worker compensation costs in the country, but following reforms in 1991, those costs have declined steadily, falling by two-thirds over the past 20 years. If a premium cost $100 in 1991, the current rate would be $33.21. If the new rate request is approved, that premium would rise to $39.62, according to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau of Massachusetts.\n\nThe bureau said insurers need the increase to cover the rising costs of health care and wage replacement, driven by higher salaries and the longer leaves that claimants are taking. The number of claims has declined, but not fast enough to offset the increases in medical and wage replacement costs, the bureau said.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognize that the current filing calls for a significant rate increase, it reflects the real costs of providing this kind of insurance,\u2019\u2019 said Meagher. \u201cWithout a rate increase, we will be unable to maintain a competitive market for workers\u2019 compensation insurance in Massachusetts.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe proposed rates will be examined in hearings held by Joseph G. Murphy, the state insurance commissioner. Murphy said yesterday that his office intends to \u201ctake a long, hard look at the process. This is a large increase, and this administration is particularly sensitive to the cost of doing business in the state.\u2019\u2019\n\nMurphy said he expects to schedule a public hearing by the end of March.",

I could see smoke from the home from here,\" the recycling center's manager, Don Taylor, told KOMO News. \"It would make me feel good if they found something here that could help answer questions about this whole terrible thing.\"\n\nPowell was the husband of missing Utah woman Susan Powell. He attacked his 5- and 7-year-old sons with a hatchet last Sunday, when a social worker brought the boys to his home for what was a supervised visit, and then ignited the house in a gas-fueled inferno.\n\nSome investigators have called the act an admission of guilt in his wife's death, but they're still looking for evidence on that front. They also located a storage locker where Powell had stashed a comforter that tested positive for the presence of blood in an initial test. Further lab tests are pending.\n\nAuthorities received a tip that Josh Powell may have dumped some papers at the LRI recycling center in the days just before the deaths.\n\nThe volunteers arrived Sunday morning and began searching through more than 20,000 pounds of recycled paper, junk mail and newspapers.\n\nA Pierce County sheriff's officer oversaw the effort.\n\nSusan Powell disappeared Dec. 6, 2009, while the Powells were still living in West Valley City, Utah.\n\nJosh Powell always claimed that on the night his wife disappeared he had taken his young sons on a midnight camping trip in subfreezing temperatures in the Utah desert, and that he knew nothing of her whereabouts.\n\nLess than a month after the disappearance, Powell moved the boys to his father's home in Puyallup, south of Seattle.\n\nPowell lost custody of his sons to his wife's parents late last year, after police said they had found child pornography on his father's computer. He later moved to the home outside Puyallup where he killed his sons Feb. 5.",

You go, and while it is great to see someone you love strut their stuff, it is nonetheless painful to watch them inch through a poorly constructed, amateurish scenario.\n\nThat's what seeing Diane Keaton and (to a lesser extent) Michael Douglas is like in And So It Goes. It's an uncomfortable experience, embarrassing for everyone involved not because of any squeamish subject matter \u2013 quite the contrary, seeing retirement-age characters are refreshing \u2013 but because the story structure is so fake and so plodding.\n\nIn a story set in the wilds of suburban Connecticut, Douglas plays Oren, a widower and real-estate agent living in a modest apartment complex as he tries to make one last big sale \u2013 his old multi-million dollar mansion. He's an acid-tongued grump, but with a soup\u00e7on of rascally charm. (The screenwriter Mark Andrus' previous work includes the Jack Nicholson vehicle As Good As It Gets.)\n\nKeaton's Leah, a childless widow in the unit next door, is a toned-down version of her Annie Hall persona. The peculiar sartorial choices and nightclub singing routines are intact, but Leah has a habit of bursting into tears during her performances (the film's only funny running gag). We meet the pair in quibble res so it's clearly only a matter of time until they admit a love for one another. To speed the process along, a moppety 10-year old girl, Sarah, is dumped on their doorstep.\n\nSarah (Sterling Jerins) is Oren's granddaughter, whom he's never met, because he and his son (a drug-taker!) are estranged. But the son has to go off to prison for a while, so looks like the old crabapple is going to learn how to make bologna sandwiches and go on carnival rides and eventually learn how to love again. As Marc Shaiman's syrupy piano score drips cinematic diabetes over scenes like little Sarah calling Leah \u201cgrandma\u201d or shooting an iPhone video of a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, Andrus' script goes all-in on the most hackneyed of sitcom staples. Grouchy Oren actually has to deliver the baby of one of the upstairs neighbors. I was waiting for the moment when they'd all get trapped in a meat locker.\n\nAnd So It Goes is betting that your familiarity with the characters will, by their sheer force of presence, \u201cwin you over\u201d. I say: stand your ground. I adore hearing Diane Keaton's unique patter and line delivery (everything she says sounds as if her mind has already raced three sentences ahead), but when she is trapped in so banal a story I find it more infuriating that this is the material she is reduced to. Two years ago she appeared opposite Kevin Kline in another high tax bracket comedy, Lawrence Kasdan's Darling Companion. This was a movie where wealthy people walked around looking for a lost dog and it wasn't exactly well-received. Compared to And So It Goes, it is a masterpiece.\n\nShockingly, And So It Goes is directed by Rob Reiner, a man whose name used to represent quality. The son of comedy icon Carl Reiner who began his career as Mike \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic on All In The Family, Reiner had an amazing streak in the 80s and early 90s. This Is Spinal Tap, The Sure Thing, Stand By Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally and Misery (all in a row!) are in no danger of losing their luster. But Reiner's recent output has been one humiliation after another.\n\nAnd So It Goes is distributed by the new, small-shingle Clarius Entertainment, which also put out this year's insultingly wretched Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return. To be in such company ought to be enough of a clue to Mr Reiner that, perhaps, he ought to consider sticking with acting. (He has a tiny role in this film and gets the only true belly laugh with a throw-away line.)\n\nIt is unfortunate that there are so few good Hollywood films about senior citizens. It's been a long time since we saw Art Carney in Paul Mazursky's Harry and Tonto. And So It Goes features a moment in which a young realtor colleague explains to Douglas how he found out information about his son: \u201cI Googled him. I friended him on Facebook. We've been texting.\u201d It's a word salad of scary \u201cnew\u201d technology, and while the digital divide between generations is a real thing, the sledgehammer-like subtlety of this moment (the quotes are verbatim) is an indicator at the level of nuance found in this film.\n\nAnd So It Goes opens in the US on 25 July, Australia on 7 August and in the UK later this year",

In 2000, the school dedicated a bust of the former Senator, attorney general and presidential candidate to UVA\u2019s Caplin Pavilion.\n\nFollowing in the steps of his big brother, Senator Edward Kennedy was a UVA law school alum, graduating in 1959.\n\nThe University of Virginia however is not only known for its frat parties and tailgates. The Law School is consistently ranked one of the top ten best in the country by U.S. News.\n\nOther law school graduates of the top-rated party school are secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano who received her degree in 1983 and the son of FDR, Franklin junior, who graduated the law school in 1940.\n\nWilson and the Kennedy\u2019s aren\u2019t the only politicians whose Alma Mater\u2019s made it onto Playboys top ten.\n\nThird and eighth-ranked party schools graduated a few big names in the 2012 election too. Senator Marco Rubio graduated in 1993 with a Bachelor of Science from Playboy\u2019s top third party school, University of Florida. Newt Gingrich\u2019s alma mater, Tulane University, came in eighth.\n\nAl Gore, who might have had a little too much fun at the number 7 ranked party school, Vanderbilt University, didn\u2019t actually graduate from either of the schools that he was enrolled in. Gore attended both the Divinity and Law Schools of Vanderbilt but never made it to graduation day.\n\nAccording to Bill Turque, author of \u201cInventing Al Gore,\u201d he failed five of the eight classes he took over the course of three semesters at the Divinity School. He did not graduate from Vanderbilt Law School either, enrolling for only a brief time and received mainly C\u2019s.\n\nHis ex- wife Tipper, however, did graduate from Vandy, receiving her Master\u2019s degree in psychology in 1976.\n\nWhen it comes to Playboy\u2019s list it seems like political wives and daughters may just want to have fun, too. University of Texas was ranked number 4 and it is the alma mater to former first family members. President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughter Lynda and President George W.

And that attention, on the whole, has been negative.\n\nMr. Aboushi\u2019s offense, apart from being a rare Arab-American in professional football, is that on June 29 he dared speak about his upbringing at the El Bireh Society convention in Arlington, Va., which attendees described as a \u201ccultural networking event.\u201d Among the details he shared, according to The Times, was his 2009 visit to refugee camps in the West Bank. That\u2019s all it took to unleash a wave of online defamation, including unfounded charges that he was a Muslim extremist and had terrorist ties. A column on Yahoo Sports, since removed, said he held anti-Semitic views. An employee of MLB.com on Twitter compared Mr. Aboushi to Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end charged with murder. He later apologized.\n\nSuch accusations were totally unfounded.\n\n\u201cMy feelings are very fair \u2014 I wish both sides (in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) would come to a peaceful agreement and both live in peace,\u201d the NFL website quoted Mr. Aboushi as saying.\n\nThe Jets came to Mr. Aboushi\u2019s defense with a statement of support and perhaps even more importantly, so did the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cOur judgment here was that he was falsely accused of being what he\u2019s not, and the next thing to do is stand up and say so,\u201d Abraham H. Foxman, the group\u2019s national director, told The Times.\n\nSuch assessments need to be even more widely circulated than the lies were. Then maybe the hate-speech will subside so that when Mr. Aboushi reports to rookie training camp on July 22 he can focus on doing what he\u2019s being paid to do \u2014 and what Jets fans would dearly love to see \u2014 win football games.",

His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",

The Nissan recalls are among nearly 8 million others made by 10 automakers, mainly in Southern high-humidity states, over the Takata air bags.\n\nThe recall affects the Infiniti FX35 and FX45 from 2003 to 2005, Infiniti I35 from 2003 and 2004 and Infiniti M35 and M45 from 2006. Also affected are Nissan Pathfinders from 2003 and 2004 and Nissan Sentras from 2004 to 2006.\n\nIn total, 52,738 vehicles are involved.\n\nThe newly recalled vehicles were sold or registered in 12 high-humidity states and territories. The humidity can cause the air bag propellant to burn too fast and potentially blow apart the metal canisters. The problem has been linked to four deaths.\n\nAffected states and territories include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas and the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Saipan, Guam and American Samoa.\n\nTakata controls about 22 percent of the global air bag market. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether Takata and automakers that use its air bags acted quickly enough once the defects were suspected.\n\nNissan announced a small recall of two Infiniti models late last month also tied to Takata-made air bags.

The Resurrection of Christ had been celebrated in churches at the stroke of midnight the night before, and it was already 12:30 in the morning by the time traditional Greek parties all over Astoria got going seriously. Soulis Drakoularakos and his wife, Voula, and their three children were up late, some until 5 A.M.\n\nYet 41-year-old Mr. Drakoularakos, who came to the United States from Athens in 1962, and his old friend Charles Pafitis, who arrived from Cyprus in the late 40's, needed to get the charcoal burning for the Easter Sunday feasting.\n\nBy 11 o'clock the fires in two long steel basins on the cement terrace outside Mr. Drakoularakos's house were smoldering, and the sun shone on tulips and violets in small front gardens all over that neighborhood, near Hoyt Avenue and 21st Street, next to the Triborough Bridge. In a couple of hours the men would put two whole lambs on spits.\n\nAstoria's Greek-born and Greek-descended population is estimated at 100,000. It is the largest ethnic group in an area that was once more Irish and German and that still contains Italians and Slavs, together with more recent black and Hispanic arrivals.\n\nSt. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church, at 31st Street and 30th Drive, was filled for the the Agape Vesper service. Only the occasional roar of a passing BMT train, on the elevated line along 31st Street, drowned out the priest's words, which were broadcast outdoors to the hundred or so parishioners who could not fit inside.\n\nElsewhere in the city Orthodox Russians were also marking the day. The Orthodox Easter, one week later than the date observed by Western churches, is based upon the requirement in Orthodoxy that the day follow the Jewish Passover. Occasionally the two observances coincide.\n\nNear the commercial crossroads of Ditmars Boulevard and 31st Street yesterday, people were buying Greek pastry and Greek-language newspapers, like The National Herald. And all over the area lambs were cooking.\n\nThe two lambs on the Drakoularakos terrace were on their spits, wired shut, by 1 P.M. One animal weighed 20 pounds, the other ''23 or 24,'' according to Mr. Pafitis, who was head chef for the day. Mr. Pafitis owns a cab and several apartment houses in Queens. Like Mr. Drakoularakos - who owns the house he lives in, as well as an auto body shop in Long Island City - Mr. Pafitis has prospered.\n\nEach eviscerated lamb was seasoned with garlic, salt, pepper, oregano and the juice of 10 to 15 lemons. ''You know how many of these I've made in my life?'' Mr. Pafitis said, leaning toward one of the lambs. ''Plenty.'' Guests arrived gradually over the afternoon. Mr. Drakoularakos's father, Antonios, had come from Greece. A brother, John, who owns a Queens sportswear factory, was there with his wife and children. Eventually more than 20 other friends and family members showed up.\n\nThere were several bottles of 1977 Achaia white wine, and Mr. Pafitis's wife, Anna, had made sugar cookies and pastries known as galaktoboureko - like baklava but with cream instead of nuts inside.\n\nBy 5 P.M. the two lambs at the Drakoularakos household were just about done, and the feast was beginning. Someone put Greek music on the tape deck, and more wine was poured, and at one point Mr. Pafitis, recalling a tradition of the season, knocked a hard-boiled egg, dyed purple, against someone else's hardboiled egg, and his own egg cracked.\n\n''Hey,'' he cried happily, ''that's good luck for you.''\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Easter celebrants at Greek Orthodox Church of Our Savior in",

            "answer": "Eyes blinked against the bright sun yesterday morning - Easter for the world's Eastern Orthodox Churches -at the neat three-story brick house of Soulis Drakoularakos in Astoria, Queens. The Resurrection of Christ had been celebrated in churches at the stroke of midnight the night before, and it was already 12:30 in the morning by the time traditional Greek parties all over Astoria got going seriously.  Soulis Drakoularakos and his wife, Voula, and their three children were up late, some until 5 A.M.   Yet 41-year-old Mr. Drakoularakos, who came to the United States from Athens in 1962, and his old friend Charles Pafitis, who arrived from Cyprus in the late 40's, needed to get the charcoal burning for the Easter Sunday feasting.   By 11 o'clock the fires in two long steel basins on the cement terrace outside Mr. Drakoularakos's house were smoldering, and the sun shone on tulips and violets in small front gardens all over that neighborhood, near Hoyt Avenue and 21st Street, next to the Triborough Bridge. In a couple of hours the men would put two whole lambs on spits."

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

Friday, we learned that on the night before the nuptials she will be staying in a suite at exclusive, clubby The Goring Hotel near Buckingham Palace. An unsurprising choice, since this small, very discreet hotel has been favored by royals for tea and such for years and has hosted luminaries such as Winston Churchill. Read reviews of the Goring on TripAdvisor: recent ones are almost uniformly raves. I love the one that talks about staff pressing a dress for the evening; so very Upstairs, Downstairs.\n\nPHOTOS: Where will William and Kate spend their honeymoon?\n\nAs for the honeymoon, the latest unsubstantiated report (in The Sunday Telegraph) has the couple making plans to visit Jordan: specifically the spectacular rose-hued ancient city of Petra and the capital of Amman, where Kate spent some time as a youngster when her father was a pilot and based there. Some find it hard to imagine that the palace would allow an heir to the throne to romp around the Middle East in these uneasy times, but who knows?\n\nAnother unsubstantiated report has the couple heading for the island of Corfu, Greece, where William's granddad, Prince Philip, was born. If they do, they need better planning than I did there. I was disappointed by the so-so food and cruise-ship crush in Corfu Town, but others rave about the island.\n\nAlso said to be contenders are the Caribbean isle of Barbuda, where William's mother, the late Princess Diana, stayed at the exclusive K Club and which is secluded; the Caribbean island of Mustique, a great favorite of William's late great aunt, Princess Margaret; the Seychelles islands, which apparently the bride and groom have previously visited and loved, but may be out of the running because the royal family is under scrutiny for spending. Also bandied about but pricey: Queensland in Australia, home to the incredible Great Barrier Reef. William proposed at a friend's cottage in Kenya, so that's probably out as a honeymoon choice, but you never know.\n\nAnd what about a private island, such as Necker Island, owned by Richard Branson?\n\nRELATED: Still room at London inns for the royal wedding\n\nOther purported choices include a cottage in Scotland, maybe near the royal retreat at Balmoral Castle. And some say the couple may forego a fancy honeymoon for the moment. By the way, the former royal yacht Britannia was the Mediterranean honeymoon base for Prince Charles and Princess Diana. But the royal family gave it up in the '90s and it is now open to the public in Edinburgh. More info here. The end of that honeymoon was spent in Scotland with Charles' family. Now, that's romantic.\n\nI know many readers may not really care where the royals honeymoon. But what about your dream destination among some named below?\n\nPosted Apr 18 2011 3:31PM",

How to drink it, how to carve it, and, of course, how to eat it.\n\nSo when one of our PEOPLE food editors tasted this stuffed pumpkin concoction at a potluck party recently, she knew the recipe had to be shared.\n\nThe dish from chef Dorie Greenspan\u2019s cookbook Around My French Table fills a hollowed-out pumpkin with only the yummiest ingredients \u2014 bread, cheese, bacon, cream and more.\n\nIt is a guaranteed party hit, and allows you to make it your own: Sub in your favorite cheeses and breads or leave out the bacon for a vegetarian-friendly option. Plus, the pumpkin serves as an edible serving bowl, which means less cleanup for you.\n\nNow put that pumpkin you\u2019ve been meaning to carve to good use and bake it into something delicious.\n\nDorie Greenspan\u2019s Pumpkin Stuffed with Everything Good Makes 2-4 servings\n\n1 medium pumpkin, about 3 pounds Kosher salt Freshly ground pepper \u00bc pound stale bread, thinly sliced and cut into \u00bd-inch chunks \u00bc pound cheese, such as Gruy\u00e8re, Emmenthal, cheddar, or a combination, cut into \u00bd-inch chunks 2\u20134 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped 4 strips cooked bacon, chopped \u00bc cup snipped fresh chives or sliced scallions 1 tbsp. fresh thyme, minced \u2153 cup heavy cream Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg\n\n1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that\u2019s just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin.\n\n2. Using a very sturdy knife, cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin so there is enough room to make it easy to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot.\n\n3. Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepper and pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well-filled. In a separate bowl, stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin.\n\n4. Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, remove the cap during the last 20 minutes so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown. Carefully transfer the pumpkin to a platter and serve immediately.",

It was the biggest gain for the benchmark index since October. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.85 points, or 1.41 percent, to 16,395.88. The Nasdaq composite rose 74.67 points, or 1.75 percent, to 4,351.97.\n\nAs investors moved back to riskier assets, prices fell for safe-play investments like bonds and gold. Oil prices also fell as the immediate threat of economic sanctions on Russia, a major oil exporter, eased. Traders had also been worried about transportation disruptions in the Black Sea, a major transit point for oil. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.68 percent from 2.60 percent late Monday.\n\nIn another sign of a greater appetite for risk, the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks set another all-time high after posting the biggest percentage gains of the major U.S. stock indexes. The Russell jumped 32.29 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,208.65. It is now up almost 3.9 percent this year.\n\nThe two-day rout and rally was just the latest twist in a volatile year for stocks, which fell almost 6 percent just last month and have since recovered to set all-time highs in recent days.\n\nSo what is an investor supposed to do in the face of this volatility?\n\nNow might be the time to revisit whether you have the investments you want, given the market\u2019s rise and volatility, said Stephen J. Carl, head equity trader at The Williams Capital Group.\n\n\u2018\u2018Maybe take some positions off the table, and you hedge yourself a little bit, for the chance that if it does go the other way and there is a downturn,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine threatened to destabilize Europe and upset oil markets. And it wasn\u2019t clear which countries might be drawn into the conflict if it got worse. Wall Street hates uncertainty, and on Monday that\u2019s all there was. So investors were relieved when Putin appeared to back down on Tuesday.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think the reaction today is probably more hopeful than rational,\u2019\u2019 said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial.\n\nMcMillan noted that Putin made his point with Ukraine just a week after the Sochi Olympics ended. Hosting the Olympics was a way for Putin to show that Russia was open for business, but the conflict with Ukraine threw that away, McMillan said.\n\nStock markets in Europe, including Moscow, and Asia recouped much of Monday\u2019s losses. Indexes in France and Germany each rose 2.5 percent, and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose 1.7 percent.\n\nThe gains were extraordinarily broad. Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. All 10 industry sectors in the S&P 500 index rose.\n\nAmong stocks making big moves:\n\n\u2014 RadioShack plunged 47 cents, or 17 percent, to close at $2.25 after reporting a wider quarterly loss. It also said it will close as many as 1,100 stores.\n\n\u2014 Qualcomm rose $2.48, or 3 percent, to $76.11 after the chipmaker announced a 20 percent increase in its quarterly dividend and added $5 billion to its stock buyback program. Buybacks generally benefit shareholders because they increase the value of remaining shares.\n\n\u2014 J.C. Penney Co. rose 33 cents, or 4 percent, to $8.29 after Standard & Poor\u2019s raised its outlook on the retailer\u2019s debt, saying Penney\u2019s performance \u2018\u2018has begun to stabilize.\u2019\u2019 Last week, Penney posted its first gain in two years at stores open at least a year.\n\n\u2014 Delta Air Lines rose $1.86, or almost 6 percent, to $34.45 after reporting strong February domestic demand and passenger revenue.",

Read on.\n\nProfile: Boris Johnson\n\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\n\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\n\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\n\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\n\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\n\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\n\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\n\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\n\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\n\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\n\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\n\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\n\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\n\nNo, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on.\n\nWhen Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\"\n\nNo, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump. Same hair though.\n\nNo, that's Julian Assange.",

That was preceded by an incident in late May when San Jose police officers were called to McDonald\u2019s house because the couple was involved in argument involving a gun. McDonald has told police his fiancee fired the gun into the ground as he was driving way from his home.\n\nMcDonald was asked if he and his fiancee have sought counseling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing stuff to try to better our relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make sure that we\u2019re not putting ourselves in situations like this because we do care about each other. We love each other.\u201d\n\nMcDonald addressed the media Tuesday for the first time since he briefly spoke to a television station after he was released on $25,000 bail on the day of his arrest and said, \u201cThe truth will come out.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report from the Santa Clara County district attorney\u2019s office, McDonald and his fiancee got in an argument at about 2:30 a.m. Aug. 31. After his fiancee struck McDonald, he forcibly restrained her during an ensuing scuffle and attempted to forcibly remove her from the house.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Lindsay Walsh said the injuries that McDonald\u2019s fiancee suffered were minor and \u201cconsistent with restraint rather than an attack.\u201d His fiancee didn\u2019t cooperate with the investigation, and McDonald wasn\u2019t charged because of \u201cinsufficient evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of guy (who) would put my hands on a woman like that,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cMy teammates know it. My friends know it. Everybody knows what kind of guy I am.\u201d\n\nWhen police arrived at McDonald\u2019s house Aug. 31, Sgt. Sean Pritchard was present. Pritchard is a San Jose police officer who also worked private security for the team. Pritchard was at McDonald\u2019s house twice during the evening. He was summoned to the scene by the 49ers\u2019 security director, whom McDonald initially contacted. McDonald called because he was concerned about text messages he was receiving from women he\u2019d met the night earlier.\n\n\u201cI wanted to just avoid putting myself in a bad situation,\u201d McDonald said, \u201cbut it ended up happening anyway.\u201d\n\nSince his arrest, McDonald\u2019s name has been included with those of former Baltimore running back Ray Rice and Carolina defensive end Greg Hardy, who have been involved in domestic-violence cases. Rice has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL and Hardy has been on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list since Sept. 17.\n\nMeanwhile, the 49ers came under criticism for allowing McDonald to start all nine games this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not those other guys,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI\u2019m just not. I know what kind of person I am. They know what kind of person I am. And that\u2019s why they let me play all the way up to this point.\u201d\n\nMcDonald has been a key part of the NFL\u2019s seventh-ranked run defense, but has yet to record a sack after collecting 11\u00bd from 2011 to 2013. He acknowledged his off-field issues have weighed on him.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be human if it didn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew the truth would come out. I knew it would eventually come out, but as far as me playing, it didn\u2019t affect me a whole lot, but it was weighing on my mind a little bit. I had all this stuff that people were saying about me that I knew wasn\u2019t true. I just had to keep my mouth shut and let the whole process play out.\u201d\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.",

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

The hourlong drama has consistently addressed complex topical social issues, and its star, Edward Asner, generated controversy himself with his public statements in opposition to United States policy in El Salvador.\n\nJames Rosenfield, executive vice president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said that Mr. Asner's political statements had not any bearing on the network's decision to cancel the show.\n\n''Emotionally, we wanted to keep it on, but the audience was eroding,'' he said. '' 'Lou Grant' was five years old, and that's when series tend to tire. Also, I think that as the show got further involved in issues it became heavier and heavier, at a time when the audience trend was toward an interest in lighter fare and escapist programming.''\n\n''This was the only issue-oriented drama on television,'' Mr. Asner responded, ''and I find it shallow that the network wouldn't have exerted itself on behalf of the show, especially so that the yahoos of the world couldn't claim another victory in their attempt to abridge free speech.''\n\nABC's decision to cancel ''Taxi'' was especially surprising. The show lost only one share point this season compared with last year, and it won the Emmy award as television's best comedy for each of the last three seasons.\n\n''It was a tough call,'' said an ABC spokesman, ''but we just felt that the show had peaked after four creatively successful years and that it was time to build for the future with a new series.'' Producer Calls Move 'Irrational'\n\nJames Brooks, producer of ''Taxi,'' and one of television's most highly regarded talents, called the ABC decision ''an irrational act.''\n\n''Do you realize how unbelievably hard it is to get a good group of people like this together for a show,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''To have it thrown off when its rating was decent and it had never missed winning the Emmy is ridiculous. ABC's decision says something about the kind of homogeneous schedule they want on the air.''\n\nIndeed, with the additional cancellation of ''Barney Miller,'' whose producers decided not to continue the show, ABC is left without a single returning series among those generally held in the highest critical regard, both inside and outside the industry.\n\nThe new shows on all three networks reflect a strong emphasis on comedy, as well as an attempt to experiment in more unusual forms. CBS, for example, is introducing a realistic comedy titled ''Square Pegs,'' set around two teen-age girls in a high school and created by Ann Beatts, one of the original ''Saturday Night Live'' writers. In drama, CBS is introducing ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' an update of the 1950's film that makes a rare attempt to incorporate music into a continuing story, and ''Bring 'em Back Alive,'' represents a stylized period drama set in 1939 that draws its inspiration from ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' Raiders-Style From ABC\n\nABC has its own Raiders-style offering in ''Brass Monkey,'' as well as an offbeat fantasy-comedy-adventure show in ''The Quest,'' in which four Americans vie for the throne in the makebelieve Mediterranean country of Glenora.\n\nBut it is NBC, the network with the lowest ratings, that seems most committed to ambitious innovation. In addition to the widely praised ''Hill Street Blues,'' the network has renewed last season's most inventive new show, ''Fame,'' despite poor ratings. Its most ambitious new show is probably ''St. Elsewhere,'' an ensemble drama that is an attempt to place the realism of ''Hill Street Blues'' in a hospital setting.\n\nNBC's most promising new realistic comedies include ''Family Ties,'' starring Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter-Birney as products of the 1960's raising a family in the 80's, and ''Cheers,'' a series set in a Boston bar. Ironically, ''Family Ties'' is being produced by Gary David Goldberg, one of the original forces behind CBS's ''Lou Grant,'' and ''Cheers,'' comes from several members of the original production team on ABC's ''Taxi.''",

Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, citing Afghan statistics, said 2,659 Afghans had applied to join the security forces in the first seven days of this month, about half of the month's recruiting objective. In the three previous months, recruiting fell short of targets, with only 830 applicants in September, he said.\n\nPresident Obama's new strategy for Afghanistan, which calls for 30,000 U.S. reinforcements next year, depends heavily on the rapid development of a well-trained Afghan force that can begin to take over security from U.S. and NATO forces. Afghanistan has about 97,000 troops and 95,000 police officers, but they are poorly trained, have high turnover rates and are prone to corruption.\n\nMuch of the cost of training and paying Afghan forces is borne by the United States and other nations, with a nominal percentage contributed by the Afghan government. An Afghan soldier costs about $25,000 a year to train, equip and maintain, compared with $100,000 for a U.S. soldier, according to Caldwell's staff.\n\nCaldwell said that before the pay increase, projections suggested that the combined force strength would reach 216,000 in July 2011 -- when Obama said he wants to begin withdrawing U.S. troops. Caldwell said the goal under the new strategy is to boost that figure by then to 282,000, a 50 percent increase over current levels.\n\n\"It's clearly a challenge to get to that number, but that's a goal we're setting for ourselves,\" he told reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. \"Realistically, we think we'll be between 250,000 and 280,000.\"\n\nA key issue in boosting the Afghan force is ensuring it achieves a balance of ethnic groups that better reflects the country's makeup. Currently, for instance, Tajiks comprise 27 percent of the population but account for 41 percent of the officers, he said.\n\nThe Afghan government announced 10 days ago that it has significantly increased base pay and added several levels of combat pay, allowing it to better compete with the monthly payments that the radical Islamist Taliban insurgency offers its recruits. In Helmand province, for instance, an entry-level soldier earning $180 a month would now make $240 a month, according to Pentagon figures. In Kunduz, pay would double from $120 to $240 a month. Police pay, which previously lagged behind military salaries, was also raised closer to parity with the Taliban's.\n\nThe Taliban offers $250 to $300 a month, said Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, deputy commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan. But that is a static number, he said, while joining the Afghan army and police offers the prospect of promotions, pay increases and a sense of national identity.\n\nMeanwhile, Rodriguez said a NATO-led attack Tuesday in the eastern province of Laghman \"possibly\" resulted in civilian deaths. \"In the confusion, there was obviously a firefight, and we are investigating,\" he said. Afghan forces participated in the attack, he said.\n\nU.S. officials say reducing civilian casualties is essential to the new strategy's success.",

That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image.\n\n'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.'\n\nMr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services.\n\nThe prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack.\n\nHe believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures.\n\n'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said.\n\nMr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation.\n\nThe prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right)\n\n'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.'\n\nHundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain.\n\nHis comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group.\n\nWaheed Ahmed, 21 \u2013 the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed \u2013 is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS.\n\nAhmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by Turkish police at the border town of Reyhanli last week. He was one of a group of nine detained, all from Rochdale, including four children aged from one to 11.\n\nThey could be flown back to the UK today.\n\nNafir Afzal last month quit the CPS despite being cleared of allegations suggesting he texted a defendant in a case.\n\nIn the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS.\n\nMr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences.\n\nThis included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions.\n\nHe said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice.\n\nMore recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall.\n\nHe also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse.\n\nThe prosecutor last year claimed that there would be a fresh wave of Operation Yewtree arrests concerning the abuse of children by celebrities.\n\nHe said: 'This is a growing industry. There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some are very high-profile figures.'\n\nMr Afzal began his CPS career in central London and went on to be awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 2 sentences.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nFortune magazine investigative reporter Peter Elkind, who co-authored The Smartest Guys in the Room, the definitive account of the Enron meltdown, spent the better part of a year investigating Steve Jobs. He talked to more than 50 people who knew and worked with Jobs, including former Apple AAPL CEOs and current members of the board \u2014 nearly everybody, it seems, except Jobs, who refused to be interviewed for the piece.\n\nThe resulting article is the cover story of the current issue. It\u2019s a great read, with more fresh details about Jobs\u2019 life and management style than any profile I\u2019ve ever read. Perhaps the most telling detail is the one laid out in the story\u2019s lead paragraphs:\n\nIn October 2003, as the computer world buzzed about what cool new gadget he would introduce next, Apple CEO Steve Jobs \u2013 then presiding over the most dramatic corporate turnaround in the history of Silicon Valley \u2013 found himself confronting a life-and-death decision.\n\nDuring a routine abdominal scan, doctors had discovered a tumor growing in his pancreas. While a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is often tantamount to a swiftly executed death sentence, a biopsy revealed that Jobs had a rare \u2013 and treatable \u2013 form of the disease. If the tumor were surgically removed, Jobs\u2019 prognosis would be promising: The vast majority of those who underwent the operation survived at least ten years.\n\nYet to the horror of the tiny circle of intimates in whom he\u2019d confided, Jobs was considering not having the surgery at all. A Buddhist and vegetarian, the Apple CEO was skeptical of mainstream medicine. Jobs decided to employ alternative methods to treat his pancreatic cancer, hoping to avoid the operation through a special diet \u2013 a course of action that hasn\u2019t been disclosed until now.\n\nFor nine months Jobs pursued this approach, as Apple\u2019s board of directors and executive team secretly agonized over the situation \u2013 and whether the company needed to disclose anything about its CEO\u2019s health to investors. Jobs, after all, was widely viewed as Apple\u2019s irreplaceable leader, personally responsible for everything from the creation of the iPod to the selection of the chef in the company cafeteria. News of his illness, especially with an uncertain outcome, would surely send the company\u2019s stock reeling. The board decided to say nothing, after seeking advice on its obligations from two outside lawyers, who agreed it could remain silent.\n\nIn the end, Jobs had the surgery, on Saturday, July 31, 2004, at Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, near his home. The revelation of his brush with death remained \u2013 like everything involving Jobs and Apple \u2013 a tightly controlled affair. In fact, nary a word got out until Jobs\u2019 tumor had been removed. The next day, in an upbeat e-mail to employees later released to the press, he announced that he had faced a life-threatening illness and was \u201ccured.\u201d Jobs assured everyone that he\u2019d be back on the job in September. When trading resumed a day after the announcement, Apple shares fell just 2.4%.\n\nYou can read the full story here, as well as an accompanying article about Apple, Inc. by Betsy Morris for which Jobs did agree to be interviewed. Both are highly recommended.\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019m an editor at Fortune and was interviewed by Elkind for his piece.",

That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image.\n\n'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.'\n\nMr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services.\n\nThe prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack.\n\nHe believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures.\n\n'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said.\n\nMr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation.\n\nThe prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right)\n\n'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.'\n\nHundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain.\n\nHis comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group.\n\nWaheed Ahmed, 21 \u2013 the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed \u2013 is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS.\n\nAhmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by Turkish police at the border town of Reyhanli last week. He was one of a group of nine detained, all from Rochdale, including four children aged from one to 11.\n\nThey could be flown back to the UK today.\n\nNafir Afzal last month quit the CPS despite being cleared of allegations suggesting he texted a defendant in a case.\n\nIn the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS.\n\nMr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences.\n\nThis included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions.\n\nHe said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice.\n\nMore recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall.\n\nHe also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse.\n\nThe prosecutor last year claimed that there would be a fresh wave of Operation Yewtree arrests concerning the abuse of children by celebrities.\n\nHe said: 'This is a growing industry. There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some are very high-profile figures.'\n\nMr Afzal began his CPS career in central London and went on to be awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

''Their brains are going to be mush. It's the future of our country. I think it's the most serious problem.''\n\nThe First Lady, who is in New York for a four-day visit, toured Phoenix House and then met with five teen-agers and their parents for a discussion of adolescent drug abuse. Mrs. Reagan strongly emphasized the role of parents in discouraging the use of drugs. The Involvement of Parents\n\n''Parents can be a very potent force,'' she said. ''They can stop an awful lot of things from happening if they really feel strongly. I'm so happy parents are becoming involved instead of pushing it off on schools, the government or the police. Once you have a child, that child is your responsibility, and you cannot foist that responsibility off onto other people.\n\n''I'm a big believer in the family unit. This is what made our country great, but the whole family structure has become so loose over the last 20 years, with the permissive approach. We've just got to get it back together.''\n\nMrs. Reagan arrived in New York Tuesday afternoon for a visit described as primarily private and social. She will remain in the city until Saturday morning and is staying at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.\n\nLast night, Mrs. Reagan attended a performance of the Joffrey Ballet at the City Center 55th Street Theater. Her only other scheduled appearance was the Alfred E. Smith dinner tonight at the Waldorf. She Begins the Discussion\n\nBut because of her interest in drug abuse, aides said, Mrs. Reagan had particularly asked to visit the main building of Phoenix House, at 253 West 73d Street. After touring the facility, which has more than 700 residents in various programs, she began the group discussion by asking the young people how and why they had started using drugs.\n\n''I was very influenced by my friends,'' said 17-year-old Anthony Galati from Yonkers. ''Peer pressure, I guess - to be accepted among the crowd. They would say, 'Oh, come on, you're not with us.' ''\n\nSome of the parents acknowledged their own responsibility for their children's actions. ''I partly participated in the process, I guess, because I smoked it,'' said Irene Gilbert during a discussion of marijuana in which her son, James, admitted to having been a heavy smoker. ''For 10 years I thought it was terrific.''\n\nDr. Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, told Mrs. Reagan that many parents were ''terrified'' to confront their children's drug abuse, fearing ''that it will be overwhelming to them, that it will rupture their relationship with their children, that it will stop them from being buddies.''\n\nMrs. Reagan commented: ''It's lovely to be a friend and say yes all the time, but there comes a point when you've got to say no. You may run the risk of losing your child for a while, but when you consider the alternative and what might happen if you don't do anything, it's a risk that's well worth taking.''\n\nThe First Lady seemed delighted when she asked the group whether it thought marijuana should be legalized and was answered with a resounding chorus of no's. During the 1960's, she recalled, ''There was this feeling that marijuana was not bad for you, that it didn't do any harm. 'Not Reading' the Updated Reports\n\n''There were those first reports that said it really isn't anything and don't worry about it,'' she added, ''and I think a lot of young people are still referring back to those reports and not reading the ones that are updated about the real dangers that exist.''\n\nMrs. Reagan was sharply critical of movies and television shows that she said ''glamorize'' drugs and alcohol. ''In a movie, for instance, they'll show somebody walking into a room,'' she said, ''and the first thing he does is go over and pour a drink. It's not necessary to the story, and they don't have to have it in there.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Nancy Reagan with Anthony Galati at Phoenix House",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 100 words.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nFew observers were surprised when tech giant Hewlett-Packard (\n\n) for hiring Mark Hurd -- HP's former CEO -- as co-president. After all, Hurd is no doubt in possession of HP's crown-jewel corporate secrets. Moreover, HP, which competes directly with Oracle in a number of critical enterprise software and hardware markets, probably had no choice, if for no other reason than to save face.\n\nBut Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is a man who inevitably gets exactly what he wants -- and in this case, what he wants may be HP itself, in order to better to compete with IBM (\n\n). But buying HP, a $90 billion Goliath? That's crazy, right?\n\n\"Larry Ellison is borderline bat-shit crazy on a good day,\" says veteran Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. \"I think his bet is that he can damage HP enough that it drops in value and he can wander in with an offer.\"\n\n\"Ellison believes he can do anything, and he wants to go after IBM,\" Enderle adds. \"If he can figure out a way to get HP, then I believe he would like to do that. Because he would really like to bring IBM out, and he needs [a company] of the stature of HP to do it.\"\n\nOracle's market capitalization is about $120 billion so, at least in theory, some kind of stock-based transaction is possible.\n\nAnd what better person to integrate HP into Oracle than its highly successful -- Hurd was loved on Wall Street, though loathed inside HP -- former CEO? At least Ellison has traded up from Charles Phillips, a once-powerful but now crippled co-president at Oracle who had spent much of his recent year in a very public and very ugly spat over adultery allegations that included a honest-to-goodness billboard campaign against the former investment banker.\n\nIndeed, Hurd has shown he can do top-notch cost-cutting of the sort that Larry likes and needs in order to integrate his myriad acquisitions. Further, Hurd and Ellison share a \"buy-it, don't-build\" mindset that should make for an easy working relationship.\n\n\"Oracle wants to rebuild Sun, and Hurd is a turnaround packager who never really sold the package at HP,\" says Enderle. \"He's left a mess, stripped to the bone, but with good financials.\"\n\nEllison is a man with ambitions as big as his MIG-29 fighter jet is fast, and he's got a history of stating that the info-tech industry will further consolidate in the same way the auto industry consolidated into the Big Three in the U.S.\n\nWith his purchase of Sun Microsystems, Ellison showed an appetite for enterprise hardware that he could use to vertically integrate sales of what is now a near-complete enterprise software stack, which includes databases, application server/middleware, customer-relationship management tools, financial applications, product-lifecycle management and enterprise resource planning tools.\n\nHP's strong position in the hardware and server market would instantly give Oracle a reason to touch millions of customers at myriad places in their business, from storage, to networking, to servers. That's a position IBM has also valued, considering its continued investments in its hardware lines like server and storage (even as it cast off its less profitable PC lines to Lenovo).\n\nTrue, lots of orphans would be left over in an Oracle-HP deal. HP's core printer and imaging unit doesn't clearly fit into Oracle's fold, nor does its big consumer and PC products or its foray into smartphones via the recent acquisition of Palm.\n\nEnderle theorizes that Ellison would spin out HP's printing and imaging business. \"But this all hinges on whether Hurd can execute,\" Enderle says. \"If I'm right, Larry wants to walk away with a [combined] company that would go head-to-head with IBM virtually anywhere. The deal would be very difficult and somewhat convoluted, but we're talking about a guy [Ellison] who lives and breathes war.\"\n\nWhen your end goal is global dominance, difficulty is a mere distraction. And this would likely be a three-year to five-year plan. HP's lawsuit will likely tie up Hurd and Oracle for quite some time, but Ellison is a powerful force, and his wishes rarely go unrealized.\n\nHP claims Hurd can't perform his new job of co-president without disclosing HP secrets in violation of his confidentiality agreement. But Enderle points out that in California, noncompete and other employment contract clauses are \"generally unenforceable.\"\n\n\"HP can go after Hurd's [$40 million] severance package,\" says Enderle, \"but they can't keep him out of Oracle.\" And what could be sweeter revenge for Hurd than winding up running HP again -- as a part of Oracle?",

Does that change when the subject is beloved, or young, or recently deceased, or all three? Is the purpose of biography to ennoble or simply record?\n\nSuch questions hover fretfully in the shadows of \u201cThe Internet\u2019s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz,\u201d a documentary whose chief aims \u2014 at which it succeeds \u2014 are to mourn a fallen activist angel and rile audiences into rage. For many people, any other approach might seem blasphemous, and this, of course, is why one should be wary. It\u2019s easy and emotionally satisfying to build a case for martyrdom. It\u2019s harder and more necessary to step back for a bigger and less passionate picture.\n\nAaron Swartz was, of course, the computer programmer and electronic freedom fighter whose suicide at 26 in January 2013 came as the US government was preparing a case against him. His alleged crime: using MIT\u2019s computer network to download millions of documents from JSTOR, a database of academic publications, with the aim of distributing them freely across the Net. His maximum potential punishment: $1 million in fines and 50 years in prison on two felony counts and 11 violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He hung himself shortly after federal prosecutors turned down a second plea offer.\n\nSwartz\u2019s death galvanized the online and activist communities who see him as a fallen soldier in the struggle for open access and the democratic future of the Internet. Even the greater public was, to some extent, radicalized by coverage of Swartz\u2019s persecution and death. It\u2019s arguable whether the current firestorm over the FCC\u2019s attempts to dismantle net neutrality would be quite so visible if Swartz hadn\u2019t put a face on the larger issue.\n\nDirector Brian Knappenberger leads us through his subject\u2019s short, initially charmed life from beginning to untimely end, starting with family videos of his toddler years that set an indulgently personal tone. We learn of Swartz\u2019s pioneering efforts \u2014 in his early teens, no less \u2014 as co-creator of the Web news syndicator RSS and the water-cooler website Reddit. And we track his growing political disenchantment and commitment to change. \u201cThe Internet\u2019s Own Boy\u201d is deft at explaining knotty technical developments and it gives Swartz\u2019s mentors like Lawrence Lessig and Tim Berners-Lee \u2014 people who\u2019ve built our online universe and are intent on protecting it from centralized government control \u2014 ample room to state their case.\n\nFrom the other side we don\u2019t hear much of anything. Stephen Heymann, the US attorney who led the prosecution, is a Voldemort glimpsed only in grainy photographs. And forget about getting his boss, Carmen Ortiz, on record. Knappenberger has said in interviews that he repeatedly approached the other side and was rebuffed or ignored; in any event, the film is less interested in journalistic balance than in eulogy and advocacy.\n\nWhich is fine, but a more nuanced portrait of Swartz might have acknowledged, as some print reporting has done, that he had his darker side and depressions, and that the abilities that made him a genuine prodigy also set him apart from the world and made him ill at ease in certain situations. It might have pointed out that the idealism that fired his political zeal \u2014 and had real and critical results, such as the failure of 2013\u2019s Stop Internet Piracy Act to pass in Congress \u2014 had its naive side, which he might have outgrown had he lived. And it might have conceded that, however draconian the government\u2019s persecution may have been, it was Aaron Swartz\u2019s decision to end his own life.\n\nBut Knappenberger can\u2019t paint his subject as an imperfect human being because Swartz simply means too much to too many people right now. He\u2019s a focal point for social and political change, with communal grief as its engine. \u201cThe Internet\u2019s Own Boy\u201d works very well on that score and easily convinces us of the enormous hole left by its subject\u2019s passing. Of the two biographical documentaries opening in the Boston area today, the one about Gore Vidal presents a portrait of a rich, well-lived life that was. Knappenberger, by contrast, has the nearly impossible task of measuring a life that might have been.\n\n\u201cThe Internet\u2019s Own Boy\u201d trailer:\n\n- The inside story of MIT and Aaron Swartz (3/30)",

It\u2019s not speed of provisioning, rogue credit-card purchases for skunk-works projects, or even integration hairballs.\n\nNo, the biggest threat to cloud-computing companies today is customer fatigue.\n\nBusinesses are tired of hearing the tech industry squawk about whether this or that is a managed service or a faux cloud or a virtualized cumulonimbus cluster or a passing shower or black cloud of doom.\n\nThey are tired of hearing what the NIST\u2019s definition of a cloud is or isn\u2019t, and whether the solution that\u2019s best for their global systems does or does not comply with the definitions of some self-appointed experts whose only certainty is that they\u2019ll capriciously change their definitions to match the prevailing winds.\n\nA top tech executive from one of the world\u2019s leading telecom providers voiced this frustration the other day by saying that he\u2019s sick and tired of the intramural squabbles among IT companies over whether private clouds are superior to public clouds, and whether hybrids are really hybrids and are they all better or worse than on-premise platforms.\n\nAt some technical level, he said, those distinctions do indeed matter and have to be designed properly and managed appropriately to deliver the desired outcomes under the required conditions.\n\nBut outside of that, he said, the only matter he truly cares about is whether the various solutions deliver to him the business value and flexibility that his company needs to be able to deliver great products and services to customers.\n\nThis executive made his points at an event for Oracle Oracle customers during a Q&A session with Oracle executive vice-president Thomas Kurian, who had been discussing what he views as the \u201cfalse dichotomy\u201d arising within some parts of the tech industry over private cloud versus public cloud. The fact is, Kurian said, that when properly designed and implemented, the differences to the business at large will be pretty much invisible.\n\nAnd that same seamlessness, he said, should extend across not only public and private clouds but also hybrids and on-premise software: to everyone above the administration layer, the underlying platforms should be unknown, nondisruptive, and irrelevant.\n\nThe telecom exec made an excellent point about the rapidly growing acceptance of cloud computing among businesspeople: we\u2019ve got the concept, he said, and we agree with the premise, and we want to tap into the potential\u2014so let\u2019s get on with it!\n\nFor cloud-computing providers, this presents a daunting challenge: can your products coexist smoothly and invisibly with all of the other platforms in the IT universe? Will your status as a niche provider make you more or less appealing to business-technology executives who\u2019ve had more than enough of the cloud-philosophy debates and are now only interested in receiving the business value that\u2019s been promised?\n\nThe customer\u2019s complaint illuminates why Oracle decided long ago to make all of its applications available seamlessly across public clouds, private clouds, hybrids, and of course on-premise.\n\nFor Oracle, it\u2019s not a matter of religion or a limited R&D budget or the constraints of an overly niched position: rather, it\u2019s all about customer choice and value and flexibility. It\u2019s about giving customers the options they want to match up with the shifting needs of global enterprises engaged in different markets with different business climates and varying regulatory requirements.\n\nSo more and more, I think the biggest threat facing cloud-computing companies will be whether or not they can get over the tech debates and instead deliver what customers want: full and unfettered choice across all of the delivery and consumption models: on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid.\n\nAnd good luck to those companies that will be forced to try to continue focusing on the technical details rather than the business value because they don\u2019t have the capabilities that business customers are seeking. Because in today\u2019s business climate, they\u2019re going to need all the luck they can get.\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @bobevansIT.\n\n10 Reasons Software On Silicon Redefines Enterprise Computing",

Despite efforts to hold down costs, unanticipated Medicaid expenses are helping to break the budgets of about two-thirds of the states, including New York. Since 1967, costs have swelled nationally from $1.9 billion to $21.7 billion, of which just over half is paid by Washington.\n\nThe Massachusetts plan has reportedly struck a responsive chord among Reagan officials, who have been trying to limit Medicaid costs. Moreover, the approach would presumably reduce regulation and the Government's role in the program.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said only that the proposal was ''under review.'' Massachusetts health officials believe that, by reversing the disincentives to save money, they can cut Medicaid costs by 20 percent or more without damaging the quality of care. They say, for example, that they are forced to spend $40 million to $50 million a year for Medicaid patients who unnecessarily use emergency rooms for routine ailments. The state is obliged to pay even though care is much cheaper in doctors' offices and clinics.\n\n''There is no gatekeeper to the system,'' Charles F. Mahoney, Secretary of Human Services in Massachusetts, said in an interview here yesterday. ''We've got an a la carte system. Patients can go anywhere and buy anything and we have to pay the bill.''\n\nThe plan proposed by Gov. Edward J. King has been tried in some small, isolated areas, but this would be the first time it would be tested on a large population - 550,000 poor people throughout Massachusetts. The idea closely resembles the subscriber-paid plans, called health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, that many middle-class people belong to either individually or through their employers. Most of those on Medicaid are welfare recipients who do not work. The Way It Would Work\n\nThis is how it would work: First the Legislature would be asked to set an overall spending cap of $839 million, or $237 million less than the $1.076 billion it would take to continue the program as is. Then private health providers - doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacies and the like - would be asked to form ''intermediaries,'' separate corporations that would run the program.\n\nEach intermediary - there might be only one - would get an annual per-capita fee for each patient it enrolled. It would be responsible for that patient's care. If efficient, it would make a profit; if not, it would lose money without further state reimbursement.\n\nMr. Mahoney conceded that such a system might invite abuse because there was a built-in incentive not to provide care. To counter this, he said the state would retain a major role in monitoring and evaluating the intermediaries. ''We are not suggesting going to an unbridled system,'' he said.\n\nIf used nationally, he believes, the plan could save $6 billion to $7 billion a year. Mr. Mahoney hopes to get a waiver from the Federal Health Care Financing Administration within a month or two so that the proposal can be taken before the forthcoming session of the Legislature. If it fails, he said, the only alternative will be to cut Medicaid services and eligibility.",

Iran has been announcing daily victories in its offensive, which reportedly began with a surprise attack on Nov. 29 and resulted in recapturing the town of Bustan in the Susangird region of Khuzistan Province. Iraqi military communiques assert that the offensive has been beaten back, but they make no mention of Bustan.\n\nIndependent assessments of the situation are not possible, since correspondents are not allowed to visit the battlefront. Iranian officials quoted by Pars, Iran's official press agency, said their forces were now pushing to seize another town, Sabla, northwest of Bustan. They said that such an attack, if successful, would cut through Iraqi lines and isolate some Iraqi units from supply lines.\n\nCopies of the Government-controlled Baghdad newspapers received here in the last few days report that reinforcements from the socalled Peoples Army have been rushed to the Iranian front. The Peoples Army, said to number more than 300,000 men, has been providing support for regular Iraqi troops.\n\nIraq's communiques indicated that its air force is being used more heavily in the fighting. Daily air attacks have been reported, with the Iraqis apparently using the Mirage fighter planes they received from France about a year ago.\n\nThe Iranians reported shooting down one of these Mirages and capturing its pilot. The Iraqi officer, brought before Iranian television cameras, said that French crews were training the Iraqis in the use of the Mirages. Mirages Sent to Iran\n\nSo far, France has delivered 25 Mirages to the Iraqis, who have been relying chiefly on Soviet-made MIG's. Reports published in the Lebanese press this week assert that the Soviet Union has resumed delivery of heavy arms to the Iraqis. An airlift of tanks and MIG-25 warplanes reportedly began last week.\n\nThe Soviet Union discontinued military supplies to Iraq after the war with Iran began in September 1980 and the Iraqi troops were scoring gains. Iraq is believed to have captured about 200,000 square miles of Iranian territory to back its demands for recognition by Iran of its claims to full sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that separates the two countries at the head of the Persian Gulf.\n\nPresident Hussein said in a speech last month that Iraq possessed more tanks and other heavy weapons than it did when the fighting started. He also declared that Iraq was capable of putting two million men under arms.\n\nBut Iranian military communiques distributed by Pars in recent days have been filled with confidence. The agency quoted the Prime Minister, Mir Hussein Moussavi, as predicting that Iranian troops would soon move the war to Iraqi territory.\n\nThe first signs that the Iraqis might be losing the initiative in the war came about two months ago when they were forced by the Iranians to abandon a position on the Karun River from which they were threatening the battered refinery center of Abadan.\n\nThis development followed the withdrawal of some Iraqi troops from the front to protect installations at home as a result of the Israeli air strike on the Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad in June. Other troops were sent to northern Iraq because of an increase in raids by Kurdish insurgents.\n\nAnother factor that appeared to be aiding the Iranians was the reported recruitment of a new Iranian fighting force and the arrival of fresh supplies of arms. The Iraqis have charged that these supplies have come from Israel.\n\nIn addition, the Iraqi Government was said to be running short of funds to finance the war with two thirds of the country's oil industry either destroyed by Iranian attacks or at a standstill because of the dangers involved in oil shipping from terminals on the Gulf.\n\nAccording to reports in the press here today, Iraq is seeking additional loans from other Arab oil-producing countries. Kuwait has reportedly agreed to provide Baghdad with a third loan of $2 billion, raising the total to $6 billion.",

The largest loss, $20.3 million, was posted by North Shore Medical Center in Salem.\n\nMass. General and North Shore Medical are both owned by Boston-based Partners HealthCare System, the state\u2019s largest hospital and physicians network.\n\nOf the state\u2019s 11 unprofitable hospitals, only Cambridge Health Alliance, which lost $6.3 million, is a standalone institution. The rest were affiliated with larger systems \u2014 Partners, Steward Health Care System, and Baystate Health \u2014 that were profitable as a whole.\n\nThe report understates the financial pressures on hospitals, said Tim Gens, executive vice president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association. He cited government reimbursement cuts, a decrease in inpatient volume, and a state push to reduce medical expenses.\n\n\u201cMargins are just one measure,\u201d Gens said. He said that North Adams Regional Hospital, which closed in March, made money in fiscal year 2013. \u201cWhat the margins don\u2019t tell you is the age of the facilities, their debt service, their access to capital, their cash on hand \u2014 all these are examples of the measures you have to pay attention to if you manage hospitals.\u201d\n\nFive profitable hospitals registered non-operating gains, from investments and other activities, that offset operating losses. They were Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, Partners-owned Nantucket Cottage Hospital, Steward-owned Norwood Hospital, and UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester.\n\nThe report showed stark differences in the financial performance of many hospitals, ranging from a 14 percent profit margin at Worcester\u2019s Saint Vincent Hospital to a nearly 23 percent loss at Steward-owned Quincy Medical Center.\n\nFigures for 50 hospitals, those on the standard fiscal year, covered the 12 months ending Sept. 30. But for some hospitals with different fiscal years, the data covered shorter periods. For Steward, which uses a calendar year, the data covered nine months. For Cambridge Health Alliance, three months of data were included.\n\nWhile the Steward hospitals as a whole earned $5.6 million during that period, four of the 10 \u2014 Quincy Medical, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Merrimack Valley in Haverhill, and Morton Hospital in Taunton \u2014 posted losses. Two Partners hospitals lost money \u2014 North Shore and Faulkner Hospital in Jamaica Plain \u2014 but Partners overall earned $292.5 million.\n\nIn addition to Boston Children\u2019s and Mass. General, the biggest money makers were Partners-owned Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, with $139 million; Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, which earned $104.6 million; and, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, with a profit of $100.1 million.",

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",

(Crime Stoppers)\n\nTwo other suspects taken into custody at the time of the shooting were released pending further investigation, police said in a release Monday.\n\nPolice also seized a vehicle found in the 4000 block of Stanley Place S.W. It is believed the suspects used the vehicle to flee the nightclub and it is now with the forensic crime scene unit.\n\nLugela already had previous matters before the court, including a charge of possession of stolen property.

Hicks signed with the Stampeders in May and was on Calgary's practice roster, although he hadn't yet played a game this season.\n\nFellow Stamps defensive back Joshua Bell said he didn't see the shooting take place and doesn't know why it happened.\n\n\"I guess wrong spot, wrong time,\" Bell said. \"Or mistaken identity, they may have thought he was somebody else \u2014 same coloured shirt, something like that.\"\n\n\"Hicks was a dog on that football field, he was 110 per cent. He knew nothing but push the button and go. It was either on or off. He was family, he family.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to Mylan's family.\"\n\nHicks played for the Michigan State University Spartans, where he recorded a career-high 19 tackles and four pass breakups in nine games in his senior year in 2014.\n\nDarien Harris, who played with Hicks on the Spartans, told the Calgary Homestretch his old friend was living the dream of many inner-city youth from crime-troubled cities such as Detroit.\n\n\"You know, you have a goal to make it out.

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 1 sentences.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nTwo of the OPEC oil cartel\u0092s 11 members, Nigeria and Venezuela, said today that they would voluntarily cut production in response to declining crude oil prices, which have fallen 20 percent from their peak two months ago.\n\nThe move, which would take less than 200,000 barrels of oil a day off the market, follows days of mixed signals from some OPEC officials, who have voiced increasing concern about the rapid drop in prices. Nigeria\u0092s oil minister, Edmund Daukoru, who is president of OPEC this year, recently said the price of oil was \u0093very low.\u0094\n\nNigeria and Venezuela, which have generally been price hawks within the group, said their decision to cut production grew out of an informal deal reached at OPEC\u0092s last meeting, earlier this month, to pare output if prices fell steeply. Some OPEC representatives have grown anxious at the slide in the oil futures markets, where prices for benchmark contracts have fallen from a midsummer high of $77.03 a barrel.\n\nBut traders shrugged off the announcement of the production cuts today. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the most widely watched contract price \u0097 light, low-sulfur crude for delivery next month \u0097 traded this afternoon at $62.30 a barrel, down 0.7 percent.\n\nMr. Daukoru has been in contact with other OPEC ministers to discuss prices, which on Monday briefly slipped below $60 a barrel for the first time in six months. But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as the cartel is formally known, denied any shift in policy.\n\n\u0093We are not currently concerned,\u0094 a delegate from one of OPEC\u0092s Gulf members said. \u0093The prices are currently manageable and fair. We\u0092re not overly alarmed by the prices. It is not a cause for alarm. It\u0092s the market working.\u0094\n\nIt is not unusual for oil prices to fall after Labor Day and the conclusion of the summer travel season. Demand tends to slow in the third quarter, and refiners reduce their output for seasonal maintenance; consumption picks up again with the first winter cold in the Western Hemisphere, and prices sometimes do as well.\n\n\u0093We are not going to push extra oil in the market or force it down our customers\u0092 throats, we just respond to demand,\u0094 the delegate from the Gulf said.\n\nStill, contradictory statements from senior OPEC representatives have sown doubt about the oil cartel\u0092s strategy. Whether OPEC countries actually reduce their output or not, the mixed messages have at least succeeded in one way: oil traders have been persuaded that OPEC is willing to step in to defend prices, and have traded on that belief, slowing the recent price decline.\n\n\u0093While apparently fanciful, reports of an imminent output cut reflect two hard facts: stocks are building faster than expected, and several producers have an incredibly low pain threshold when it comes to price drops,\u0094 Antoine Halff, an energy analyst with Fimat, wrote in a note to clients today. \u0093However, more price declines will likely be needed before OPEC producers decide on any coordinated move.\u0094\n\nVenezuela, which pumps about 2.5 million barrels a day, said it would cut its daily output by 50,000 barrels, or about 2 percent, starting Oct. 1. Nigeria said it would trim its exports by 5 percent on the same date, a reduction of about 120,000 barrels a day from its current output of about 3.8 million barrels a day.\n\n\u0093They are trying to influence the psychology of the market,\u0094 said Larry Goldstein, a veteran oil analyst and the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. \u0093Although they are reacting to the reduction in demand, they are trying to convince the market that they are actually anticipating it, by making cuts ahead of the market. But they are simply reacting to it, which is how markets should operate.\u0094",

After Columbine, we should have had greater sensitivity in these kinds of ads,\u201d said Ganis, referring to the 1999 Colorado school shooting that left 12 students and a teacher dead. \u201cThat\u2019s not a political statement. I think even the NRA would agree it\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d\n\nSteenkamp\u2019s death represents just the latest stumble for Nike, the global sportswear company that was still reeling from its relationship with disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong when South African prosecutors filed murder charges against Pistorius on Thursday.\n\n\u201cNike extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to all families concerned following this tragic incident,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs it is a police matter, Nike will not comment further at this time.\u201d\n\nRELATED: BONDY: IN LIFE, BLADE RUNNER FAR FROM HEROIC\n\nGanis said Nike\u2019s links to troubled athletes are partially just bad luck and partially its own fault. The company has sponsorship agreements with scores of athletes, teams and schools around the world, and it is inevitable that some of their partners would become mired in controversy.\n\n\u201cSometimes they are a target simply because of their size,\u201d Ganis said.\n\nNike officials could not have foreseen that Kobe Bryant would be charged with sexual assault in 2003, or that Tiger Woods would become embroiled in an infidelity scandal, he added.\n\nBut the cutthroat competitive nature that made Nike the worldwide leader in shoes and sportswear has had a dark side, he said. Nike likes to associate itself with the best in a wide variety of sports, which explains why it has had sponsorship deals with top athletes who have been linked to performance-enhancing drugs, including Armstrong, Marion Jones and Alex Rodriguez.\n\nPHOTOS: OSCAR PISTORIUS CHARGED WITH MURDER OF REEVA STEENKAMP\n\nAnd sometimes the company has responded to controversy in bizarre and confusing ways.\n\nNike founder Phil Knight, for example, initially defended Joe Paterno after the Penn State football coach was fired in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse scandal. The company removed Paterno\u2019s name from the childcare facility at its Oregon headquarters after former FBI director Louis Freeh issued his report on the scandal in July.",

'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.'\n\nA stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event.\n\nMendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre.\n\nMendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield.\n\nAnticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.\n\n'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.'\n\nLamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.\n\nMeanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.\n\nWatch UFC Fight Night: Mendes vs. Lamas live on BT Sport 1 on Saturday, April 4.

Bush will discuss the book on Oprah Winfrey's show.\n\nDrudge says a top Bush source explains: \"You will find the president strong, loving life, and ultimately at peace with the decisions he made.\"\n\nThe book was #29 on Amazon's hit list early Thursday.

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

But Sparks' sentimental dramas, the most recent being Dear John and The Last Song, are not made to win awards, just hearts.\n\nNot that Efron doesn't make the best of a predictable role. He plays Sgt. Logan Thibault, who returns from his third tour of duty in Iraq and hoofs it from Colorado to Louisiana, accompanied by his dog, Zeus. What prompts this trek? A photo of an unknown woman that he stumbled across on the battlefield. Logan credits her smiling visage with keeping him alive. With only the knowledge that her name is Beth and a vague idea of where she lives, he tracks her down.\n\nThough he's tough enough for battle, he can't summon the courage to explain his purpose to Beth (Taylor Schilling). So he settles for a job at the dog-training business Beth runs with her grandmother Ellie (Blythe Danner). He also makes fast friends with her 7-year-old son, Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart), and stoically suffers the insults of Beth's bullying ex-husband (Jay R. Ferguson) \u2014 who also is the town sheriff.\n\nThe Lucky One** out of fourStars: Zac Efron, Taylor Schilling, Blythe Danner, Jay R. Ferguson Director: Scott HicksDistributor: Warner Bros. Films Rating: PG-13 for some sexuality and violence Running time: 1 hour, 41 minutes Opens today nationwide\n\nThe story arc follows an established formula for Sparks' adaptations. The checklist includes: a brawny but caring young man who often harbors a secret; an attractive but emotionally wounded woman; an impediment to their getting together, usually in the form of a meddlesome former flame; a gorgeous American heartland setting; and a scene of the leading man bare-chested, showing off his toned pecs, leading to tasteful PG-13 lovemaking.\n\nFive Questions w/ Zac Efron\n\nDespite Logan's abundant charms, Beth initially resists him for no real reason other than to allow him to prove his undying ardor. Equally inexplicable: The townsfolk regard the dashing war veteran as a no-good bum.\n\nSo the clich\u00e9s are as thick as a vat of honey. And the love story proves just as syrupy. But for those who lap up this sappy vision of romance, it contains all the key ingredients.\n\n, visit our FAQ's. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor\n\n.

It is likely to pass, giving union leaders the authority to order a work stoppage. The law does not require the unions to give notice before walking off the job, but BART's unions have typically given the agency and public a 72-hour notice.\n\nBoth sides insist they want to avert a strike. BART negotiators met with Service Employees International Union Local 1021, which represents 1,430 mechanics and maintenance workers late into the night Friday, said BART spokeswoman Alicia Trost, and reached agreements on eight issues. Negotiations with Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555, which represents train operators and station agents, took place Monday afternoon.\n\n\"We are not ready to talk about strike contingencies,\" Trost said. \"We think there is a deal to be had.\"\n\nAntonette Bryant, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555, which represents 945 train operators and station agents, also declined to discuss the possibility of the unions shutting down BART, which gives commuters 400,000 rides each weekday.\n\n\"What we want is to bargain,\" she said. \"We're not interested in talking about a strike.\"\n\nRegional transportation officials are warning commuters to be prepared for a strike and plan ahead. Randy Rentschler, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the Bay Area's transportation planning and financing agency, said the region's other transit operators will meet Tuesday to discuss a strategy if BART workers walk off the job, but whether AC Transit, which provides bus service across the bay, will help is up in the air.\n\nThe union representing its drivers has approved a strike authorization vote, and the contract for those drivers also expires on Sunday.\n\nIn the past, transit agencies have tried to accommodate extra commuters by boosting transbay and Peninsula bus service, increasing ferry service from the East Bay and encouraging more carpooling. Some transit agencies, such as Caltrain and Muni, are already carrying full loads during the commutes.\n\n\"There are seats on buses into the city and lots of empty seats in cars,\" Rentschler said, \"and we will try to take advantage of those. But there aren't 400,000 empty seats. BART is a major high-capacity system, and it can't be replaced. Any BART stoppage is going to put some pain on folks.\"\n\nThe Amalgamated Transit Union and SEIU filed a lawsuit against BART Monday in Alameda County Superior Court seeking an unfair labor practices declaration and alleging that the transit agency is failing to bargain in good faith on safety issues, which the unions have emphasized. BART denied those accusations and accused the unions of trying to shift attention away from compensation issues.\n\nBART is seeking to persuade its employees to start contributing to their pensions and to increase their monthly health insurance payments, which are now a flat $92 regardless of the plan or the number of people covered. It also wants to reduce overtime expenses by changing work rules so that employees who call in sick one day are not paid overtime if they work an extra day. The transit agency said it needs to rein in costs as part of its effort to raise its share of the $15 billion it needs to pay for new rail cars, a modernized train maintenance facility and an improved train control system.\n\nBART has fabricated its budget to obscure the fact it's generating a $125 million operating surplus, the unions contend. Workers, who went without raises for the past five years, deserve some of that money, the unions say, not only to make up for doing without but to reward them for soaring ridership and reliability rates of about 96 percent.\n\nThe unions have proposed 5 percent annual raises over the next three years with an annual cost of living adjustment. BART estimates that as a 23.2 percent raise. The transit district has offered a 1 percent raise each year of a four-year agreement. Most train operators and stations agents are paid annual salaries in the low- to mid-$60,000 range, though BART says they are also paid an average of $16,590 in overtime pay. The last BART strike, which lasted six days, was in September 1997.\n\nMichael Cabanatuan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail: mcabanatuan@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @ctuan",

The museum is mounting the exhibit to mark its 50th anniversary.\n\n\"After only 50 years, we may be one of only a very few museums worldwide that can tell such a broad story from its own holdings,\" museum director James Snyder said.\n\nA 5,000-year-old Mesopotamian tablet on loan to the museum and 2,700-year-old coins from what is now Turkey, are also on display. An original handwritten manuscript of Albert Einstein's groundbreaking theory of relativity caps the exhibit.",

Penn Central Down 4 1/2\n\nPenn Central, No.2 on the active list, fell 4 1/2 points, to 41 1/2, reflecting two developments. The company, whose stock has been strong in recent weeks, said on Wednesday that, despite Wall Street rumors, it was not negotiating to be acquired by Esmark or any other company. In addition, Penn Central, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1978 and now operates successfully as a conglomerate, stressed its intention to proceed with the proposed takeover of Colt Industries despite the opposition of a group of Penn Central's preferred shareowners. This sent Colt's stock ahead 7 points, to 80.\n\nKaiser Steel fell 2 points, to 40 3/4, after the West Coast steelmaker said it had terminated talks regarding its possible acquisition by an investor group led by Stanley Hiller Jr.\n\nThe Jos. Schlitz Brewing Company dropped 1 7/8, to 10 5/8. In the Reagan Administration's first comment on a major corporate merger, the Justice Department announced Wednesday that it would oppose the $494 million acquisition of Schlitz by the G.

The producer of distributed data processing systems reported flat earnings for its September quarter after showing higher profits in the first half of 1981.\n\nAnother big loser was Gearhart Industries, falling 4 points, to 24 3/8, after the company said that earnings for its quarter ending Oct. 31 may run below the level of a year earlier. In 1980, this stock sold at a record price of 60 3/4.\n\nMinnesota Mining, showing the largest loss among the 30 Dow industrials, dropped 1 3/8, to 50 1/2, after reporting lower quarterly profits.\n\nOn the American Stock Exchange, higher prices for several large energy companies helped to send the exchange's market value index ahead 3.66, to 309.30.

Directed by Tim Johnson and Patrick Gilmore. Running time: 86 mins. Rated PG: Some vulgar humor. 1.5 Stars.\n\nAll the magic at the disposal of today's filmmakers cannot bring to life this unappealing animated children's movie.\n\nAnimation has come a long way since that master of special effects\n\nRay Harryhausen made skeletons walk in 1963 in the otherwise live-action \"Jason and the Argonauts.\" Harryhausen also worked his magic on \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" (1958), back when the Sinbad legend was serious stuff.\n\nYes, the seven seas roil and splash magnificently here with the aid of computer-graphic animation programs. And, yes, the evil, purplish goddess Eris is all fabulously undulating hair, a sensuous, sinuous seaweed bed of possibility.\n\nThen there's Brad Pitt, providing the voice of Sinbad as if he's a surfer dude just stumbling through on his way to a cold beer.\n\n\"I've got places to go, things to do, stuff to steal!\" mumbles Sinbad, a pirate who - tragically, one supposes - has forgotten the meaning of loyalty.\n\nThe other voice talents at least make an effort: Michelle Pfeiffer as the lasciviously cackling Eris and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Marina, a feisty stowaway who gives Sinbad a conscience and proof that women aren't useless baggage.\n\nBut preachy morality, a flat modern flavor and pockets of gratuitously coarse humor make this \"Sinbad\" a chore more distressing than fighting off giant calamari or outrunning the song of the sirens.\n\nSinbad's task is to retrieve the Book of Peace from Eris' netherworld and return it to a mythical kingdom in exchange for the life of an old friend.\n\nThere hasn't been this much to-do over a book since well, since the new Harry Potter. Nobody wants to read the Book of Peace, however. Sinbad simply wants to stir up a bidding war, the mythological version of eBay.\n\nAnimation never has been able to render the human male very interestingly, so both Sinbad and his childhood friend Proteus (Joseph Fiennes) feature faces like geodesic domes; that is, planes interrupted by the occasional sharp angle. (Marina, the girl they both love, looks marginally better.)\n\nKale (Dennis Haysbert), a sidekick character, seems to exist solely for one of the dirty-minded gags this movie throws off like mud from a potter's wheel.\n\nThe old Sinbad movies gave that sailor the narrative respect he deserved. This version is formulaic and crass, hardly the stuff of grand adventure.",

Susan Carlson, 55, has a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonality disorder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a diagnosis she is disputing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's a bad label,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nCapt. Susan Carlson was not a typical recruit when she volunteered for the Army in 2006 at the age of 50. But the Army desperately needed behavioral health professionals like her, so it signed her up.\n\nThough she was, by her own account, \u201cnot a strong soldier,\u201d she received excellent job reviews at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where she counseled prisoners. But last year, Captain Carlson, a social worker, was deployed to Afghanistan with the Colorado National Guard and everything fell apart.\n\nAfter a soldier complained that she had made sexually suggestive remarks, she was suspended from her counseling duties and sent to an Army psychiatrist for evaluation. His findings were shattering: She had, he said in a report, a personality disorder, a diagnosis that the military has used to discharge thousands of troops. She was sent home.\n\nShe disputed the diagnosis, but it was not until months later that she found what seemed powerful ammunition buried in her medical file, portions of which she provided to The New York Times. \u201cHer command specifically asks for a diagnosis of a personality disorder,\u201d a document signed by the psychiatrist said.\n\nVeterans\u2019 advocates say Captain Carlson stumbled upon evidence of something they had long suspected but had struggled to prove: that military commanders pressure clinicians to issue unwarranted psychiatric diagnoses to get rid of troops.\n\n\u201cHer records suggest an attempt by her commander to influence medical professionals,\u201d said Michael J. Wishnie, a professor at Yale Law School and director of its Veterans Legal Services Clinic.\n\nSince 2001, the military has discharged at least 31,000 service members because of personality disorder, a family of disorders broadly characterized by inflexible \u201cmaladaptive\u201d behavior that can impair performance and relationships.\n\nFor years, veterans\u2019 advocates have said that the Pentagon uses the diagnosis to discharge troops because it considers them troublesome or wants to avoid giving them benefits for service-connected injuries. The military considers personality disorder a pre-existing problem that emerges in youth, and as a result, troops given the diagnosis are often administratively discharged without military retirement pay. Some have even been required to repay enlistment bonuses.\n\nBy comparison, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder is usually linked to military service and leads to a medical discharge accompanied by certain benefits.\n\nIn recent weeks, questions about whether the Army manipulates psychiatric diagnoses to save money have been raised at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Wash., where soldiers undergoing medical evaluations before discharge complained that psychiatrists rescinded PTSD diagnoses, leaving the soldiers with diagnoses like personality disorder that did not qualify them for medical discharges.\n\nIn a memorandum, an Army ombudsman wrote that a doctor from the base hospital, Madigan Army Medical Center, said that one diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder can cost $1.5 million in benefits over a soldier\u2019s lifetime. The doctor also counseled his colleagues to be good stewards of taxpayer money by not \u201crubber-stamping\u201d such diagnoses.\n\nIn the wake of those complaints, the Army has removed the head of Madigan and suspended two doctors at a special forensic psychiatric unit. It has also reviewed the cases of 14 soldiers and reinstituted PTSD diagnoses for 6 of them.\n\nSome senior military officials have raised concerns that PTSD is overdiagnosed. Still, the Defense Department has denied that it uses psychiatric diagnoses either to weed out injured or low-performing troops, or to save money.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to provide the most accurate diagnosis,\u201d said Maria Tolleson, a spokeswoman for the Army Medical Command.\n\nOn Captain Carlson\u2019s case, the Colorado National Guard declined to comment. Officials at Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg, N.C., said the psychiatrist who evaluated Captain Carlson in Afghanistan, Maj. Aniceto Navarro, was not available for an interview.\n\nBut in a statement, the hospital said: \u201cNo commander may order a credentialed clinician to make a particular diagnosis. Dr. Navarro did not feel he was being ordered by the service member\u2019s command to make a particular diagnosis. The sentence referenced was written in terms of the commander asking to evaluate for a personality disorder, i.e. asking if one existed, not ordering to diagnose a personality disorder.\u201d",

They have their own tricks for avoiding the crowds.\n\n\"I've got it down to a science,\" Aaron Martinsen, 28, said at 8:15 a.m. Wednesday as he waited at the MacArthur Station in Oakland to board a train for his teaching job in San Francisco.\n\n\"There's one Millbrae train that comes at this time that's usually empty, and the doors on that side of the train don't open again until Embarcadero, where I get off,\" Martinsen said. \"I can just fit in with my bike at the last moment and I'm not in anybody's way.\n\n\"It took me a couple months of getting the stink eye from people to figure it out.\"\n\nOthers linger at the first and last cars to outsmart the herds that wait near the middle.\n\n\"I'll skip a crowded train, and I'll look for a nine- or 10-car train,\" said Carlos Perez, 39, an insurance underwriter who works in San Francisco. \"I have time this morning, so I can afford to wait.\"\n\nBART officials began exploring a way to share train-crowd data in January after daily ridership topped 400,000, the most the system has ever carried.\n\nTwo employees, from the agency's scheduling department and its Web department, analyzed ridership numbers from six weeks in January and February and packaged them for passengers using the trip planner.\n\nThe site shows the expected crowd for the trains as they pull into the first station. The estimates are just that - numbers are based on historic patterns, not real-time information - and they're available only for weekdays.\n\nPerez and other regular riders at MacArthur said they probably wouldn't check the feature. But John Winsor, a 45-year-old librarian who rides only a few times a year and was taking a train Wednesday to get to a conference, is exactly the kind of rider BART hopes to help.\n\nWinsor lined up dutifully behind a dozen people waiting for their ride to San Francisco. The train whooshed to a stop and the doors opened to show a crush of passengers casting rueful looks at their new companions.\n\nMost managed to squeeze in, but Winsor stepped back when he heard the operator say another train was two minutes behind.\n\n\"I've never been a BART commuter,\" Winsor said. \"If another train is coming in two minutes, it's nice that the operator told us. But if an app could tell me the same thing, I'd plan my trip around it.\"\n\nThe three-headed scale doesn't allow much room for nuance. The next train, which had plenty of room for Winsor and the other stragglers, was also marked as a three-headed train.\n\nTrost said some trains historically are less crowded than others, even at the height of the commute, and that riders can benefit from knowing which ones those are ahead of time.\n\nFor some riders on the heaviest commute routes, however, there are no lightly traveled trains.\n\n\"Crowded-wise? They're always crowded. I don't know if it helps anything to have that information,\" said Megan Neureuter, 41, who helps run a study-abroad program in San Francisco.\n\nFew of her fellow riders said they could just let the sardine-can trains slide by for something a little more comfortable.\n\n\"I mind being crowded,\" said Eric Street, 25, a retail manager. \"But my boss minds me being late more.\"\n\nEllen Huet is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Washington GM Bruce Allen and coach Mike Shanahan have always been pros at disguising their draft intentions. Scott Pioli, in his second draft in Kansas City, has his front office locked down. The Seahawks, Bills and Jags have muzzles on too. With those five teams in the top 10, Brandt's theory -- which is correct, I believe -- will bear fruit this year. One or more of those teams will pull off a shocker.\n\nIt's during times like these that doing a mock draft becomes most difficult. But I've learned over the years to ignore much of what's said in April when I put the mock jigsaw together.\n\nTake the Redskins. Washington has a crying need for a tackle, its biggest need by far. There are three or four very good ones projected as top picks. Washington has the fourth pick in the first round, its only pick in the top 100. Shanahan twice shocked the world with Denver, picking John Mobley (1996) and Jay Cutler (2006) when no one had a clue he cared about either. His son, new offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, has been talking about how swell he thinks his line is, particularly tackles Stephen Heyer and Artis Hicks. Allen and Mike Shanahan have said they might take a quarterback at number four.\n\nWell, they might. But if you just traded for a veteran passer (Donovan McNabb) with three or four years left, with no one to protect his blind side, drafting into the teeth of a top-tackle draft, with one pick in the top 100 ... I mean, would your pick be Jimmy Clausen?\n\nMine wouldn't be either. So here's my mock draft, finalized last weekend in time for the magazine's deadline, with a tackle to Washington and two trades I project in the top half of the round. Trades -- always stupid to project. But I know Denver and Miami are talking about moving down, and I'm rolling some dice. In, as Brandt says, a very dicey first round. (Click players' names for complete profiles)\n\n1. St. Louis Sam Bradford, QB, Oklahoma\n\nRams need a face of the franchise -- and an accurate deep arm. Bradford's both.\n\n2. Detroit Ndamukong Suh, DT, Nebraska\n\nCoach Jim Schwartz had Albert Haynesworth in Tennessee. He thinks Suh's better.\n\n3. Tampa Bay Gerald McCoy, DT, Oklahoma\n\nEasiest pick in the draft. For Bucs, value of McCoy is twice any other player left.\n\n4. Washington Trent Williams, T, Oklahoma\n\nGot a sick feeling Shanahan wants to deal down, pick a QB. Crazy, but that's him.\n\n5. Kansas City Bryan Bulaga, T, Iowa\n\nSinking on most boards, but GM Pioli sees meat-and-potatoes left tackle for a decade.\n\n6. Seattle Russell Okung, T, Oklahoma State\n\n'Hawks rejoice. A month ago, Okung was top tackle on most NFL draft boards.\n\n7. Cleveland Eric Berry, S, Tennessee\n\nBut if Williams or Okung's around, this will be a very tough call for GM Tom Heckert.\n\n8. Oakland Anthony Davis, T, Rutgers\n\nChalk pick -- big, athletic OT -- but since when do Raiders make the chalk pick?\n\n9. Buffalo Dan Williams, DT, Tennessee\n\nChan Gailey gets the only top nose tackle in draft to anchor his 3-4 defense.\n\n10. Jacksonville C.J. Spiller, RB, Clemson\n\nI know he has Maurice Jones-Drew ... but Jack Del Rio thinks Spiller can be the next Chris Johnson.",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 100 words.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nAsserting that the future of the nation depends upon its response to adolescent drug abuse, Nancy Reagan yesterday called upon American parents to take responsibility for their children and to become involved in drug-therapy efforts.\n\n''If we don't do something, it seems to me we're just going to lose a whole generation,'' she said during a discussion at Phoenix House in Manhattan, the nation's largest drug-rehabilitation center. ''Their brains are going to be mush. It's the future of our country. I think it's the most serious problem.''\n\nThe First Lady, who is in New York for a four-day visit, toured Phoenix House and then met with five teen-agers and their parents for a discussion of adolescent drug abuse. Mrs. Reagan strongly emphasized the role of parents in discouraging the use of drugs. The Involvement of Parents\n\n''Parents can be a very potent force,'' she said. ''They can stop an awful lot of things from happening if they really feel strongly. I'm so happy parents are becoming involved instead of pushing it off on schools, the government or the police. Once you have a child, that child is your responsibility, and you cannot foist that responsibility off onto other people.\n\n''I'm a big believer in the family unit. This is what made our country great, but the whole family structure has become so loose over the last 20 years, with the permissive approach. We've just got to get it back together.''\n\nMrs. Reagan arrived in New York Tuesday afternoon for a visit described as primarily private and social. She will remain in the city until Saturday morning and is staying at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.\n\nLast night, Mrs. Reagan attended a performance of the Joffrey Ballet at the City Center 55th Street Theater. Her only other scheduled appearance was the Alfred E. Smith dinner tonight at the Waldorf. She Begins the Discussion\n\nBut because of her interest in drug abuse, aides said, Mrs. Reagan had particularly asked to visit the main building of Phoenix House, at 253 West 73d Street. After touring the facility, which has more than 700 residents in various programs, she began the group discussion by asking the young people how and why they had started using drugs.\n\n''I was very influenced by my friends,'' said 17-year-old Anthony Galati from Yonkers. ''Peer pressure, I guess - to be accepted among the crowd. They would say, 'Oh, come on, you're not with us.' ''\n\nSome of the parents acknowledged their own responsibility for their children's actions. ''I partly participated in the process, I guess, because I smoked it,'' said Irene Gilbert during a discussion of marijuana in which her son, James, admitted to having been a heavy smoker. ''For 10 years I thought it was terrific.''\n\nDr. Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, told Mrs. Reagan that many parents were ''terrified'' to confront their children's drug abuse, fearing ''that it will be overwhelming to them, that it will rupture their relationship with their children, that it will stop them from being buddies.''\n\nMrs. Reagan commented: ''It's lovely to be a friend and say yes all the time, but there comes a point when you've got to say no. You may run the risk of losing your child for a while, but when you consider the alternative and what might happen if you don't do anything, it's a risk that's well worth taking.''\n\nThe First Lady seemed delighted when she asked the group whether it thought marijuana should be legalized and was answered with a resounding chorus of no's. During the 1960's, she recalled, ''There was this feeling that marijuana was not bad for you, that it didn't do any harm. 'Not Reading' the Updated Reports\n\n''There were those first reports that said it really isn't anything and don't worry about it,'' she added, ''and I think a lot of young people are still referring back to those reports and not reading the ones that are updated about the real dangers that exist.''\n\nMrs. Reagan was sharply critical of movies and television shows that she said ''glamorize'' drugs and alcohol. ''In a movie, for instance, they'll show somebody walking into a room,'' she said, ''and the first thing he does is go over and pour a drink. It's not necessary to the story, and they don't have to have it in there.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Nancy Reagan with Anthony Galati at Phoenix House",

The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on.\n\n'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.'\n\nThe slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week.\n\nShe added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being.\n\n'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now.\n\n'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone.\n\n'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages.\n\n'Now I can spend more time with the kids.'\n\nLizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'.\n\nShe added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes.\n\n'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done.

Monday's test marks the first encounter between the clubs this season in Los Angeles, as Chicago recorded home wins over the Kings on Dec. 15 and 30.\n\nThe Kings enter Monday's showdown mired in a major offensive funk, having scored only three goals over the past three games. Anze Kopitar has all three of the team's goals during that span on 21 shots, while the rest of the Kings have no goals on 163 shots in the past six games. The last Kings player other than Kopitar to score was defenseman Robyn Regehr when he tallied in a 5-3 loss at Columbus on January 21.\n\nL.A. was shut out for the third time in five games on Saturday, as the Philadelphia Flyers recorded a 2-0 road win at the Staples Center. Steve Mason made 35 saves for the visitors, as the Kings failed to score despite outshooting the Flyers by a 35-13 margin.\n\nJonathan Quick allowed both goals on 13 shots in the Kings' third straight defeat. Quick is just 1-6-1 over his last eight games despite allowing two goals or less five times during that span.\n\n\"You have to score to win, you can't win with nothing. You can't get frustrated; you can't allow guys who are playing well to get frustrated, you have to see if they can work their way out of it,\" said Los Angeles head coach Darryl Sutter.\n\nSaturday's setback dropped the Kings to 1-7-1 over their last nine games and the club is now only three points ahead of Vancouver for third place in the Pacific Division. The Canucks also currently hold the last of eight playoff spots in the Western Conference.\n\nL.A. is playing the third test of a four-game homestand tonight. The Kings are 16-9-3 as the host this season, but have dropped three in a row at the Staples Center.\n\nChicago also enters Monday's test on a down note, as the defending champs have lost five of their last six games. However, the Blackhawks have managed to record a point in three straight tests, posting a 1-0-2 record at the start of a seven-game road trip.\n\nThe Blackhawks won't play another home game until after the NHL returns from its break for the Winter Olympics and that test on March 1 against the Pittsburgh Penguins will be played outdoors at Soldier Field. Chicago's next game at the United Center isn't until March 4 against Colorado,\n\nSan Jose edged the visiting Blackhawks in a 2-1 shootout decision on Saturday. Joe Pavelski, Patrick Marleau and Joe Thornton all scored in the game's decisive phase to give the Sharks the extra point.\n\nBrandon Saad scored the lone goal in regulation for the Blackhawks. Corey Crawford turned aside 38-of-39 shots through 65 minutes of action, but Chicago fell for the sixth time in their last seven games that have reached the shootout phase.\n\n\"It's a tough loss, I think. We played well,\" Crawford said. \"They're a good team in their building. We definitely had a chance again to win tonight -- a couple of chances late to win the game, we've just got to figure it out in the shootout.\"\n\nChicago is second in the NHL with 80 points, but is only one point in front of St. Louis for the Central Division lead.\n\nThe Blackhawks have won four of the past five regular-season meetings in the series against the Kings and have claimed five of six in L.A.",

He says that she is a \u201cpretty terrific\u201d kid, but can be demanding at times--like most kids her age.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking that if this was a conversation between me and another adult, it would be absurd,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cBut because it\u2019s a toddler, no one blinks an eye.\u201d\n\nRELATED: J.J.

The actor is dressed just like the toddler, wearing a purple shirt and jeans. He\u2019s fastened Coco\u2019s pink clip into his hair. A silver heart necklace hangs around his neck.\n\nWhen Clarke tries to speak to his wife, Leila Harrison, Milchard interrupts their conversation.\n\n\u201cNo. You can't talk to her right now,\u201d Milchard says in the video, holding a brown-haired doll and looking quite serious.\n\n'Well that's my wife and I can talk to my wife whenever I want to talk to my wife,' Clarke replies.\n\nRELATED: ATLANTA 13-YEAR-OLD\u2019S RAP VIDEO INVITATION TO BAR MITZVAH GOES VIRAL\n\nBut Milchard refuses to let him have his way.

Coco is even given a writing credit.\n\nRELATED: VIRAL VIDEO: CROCODILE VS.

His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",

''It was made by the players I went against.'' So Coach Walt Michaels watched with a smile today as Joe Pellegrini, an offensive lineman on injured reserve who is out for the year but who is used by the Jets in practices, playedDobler's role of right guard.\n\n''I'm not saying he's going to do anything illegal in the game,'' Michaels said about Dobler after the workout. ''But it doesn't hurt to prepare, does it?''\n\nMichaels did not tell Salaam about what Pellegrini had been ordered to do, and so Salaam could not understand why Pellegrini fouled him. Finally, after several clashes across the line, and after Pellegrini got his hand near the face guard, Salaam had enough. He jumped offside and pounded into Pellegrini.\n\nThat amused Michaels. As Salaam left the field when practice was over, Michaels asked him, ''Hey, Abdul, did you jump offside on purpose?''\n\n''Sure,'' Salaam said. Jets Cut Penalties\n\nTheoretically, today's practice exercise will help prepare Salaam to remain unintimidated Sunday afternoon at Shea Stadium, when the Jets will try to improve their record to 3-3-1. They have cut down significantly on their penalties in the last two games, committing only five in each, after having been called for 44 penalties in the first four games.\n\nBut Dobler has been on Michaels's mind. The coach said he was angered by a statement attributed to Dobler, criticizing the Jets for trying for a tie, instead of a victory, in the overtime game at Miami two Sundays ago.\n\nWhen told of the Jets' anger, Dobler said that he had been misunderstood. ''English is an ambiguous language,'' Dobler said. ''All I was talking about was my philosophy of football - that I would have gone for it. Don't you think I'm smart enough that after 10 years I wouldn't say anything to give the New York Jets something to pin up in their locker room?'' Protecting the Quarterback\n\nDobler is in his second year with the Bills, after reaching notoriety with the St. Louis Cardinals in the mid-1970's. He was later traded to the New Orleans Saints.\n\nThese days he is especially proud of the Bills' sack record: they lead the league, having permitted only three against their two quarterbacks.\n\n''It's the only statistic an offensive lineman has,'' said Dobler. ''When O.J. Simpson rushed for 2,000 yards his line didn't get an award. I was on St. Louis then, and we had the fewest sacks. We got one.''\n\nKeeping players like Salaam away from the quarterback is one reason Dobler enjoys playing football. ''I don't have too many friends my age who can go out on a field on Sunday and run around,'' Dobler said. Later today, Michaels seemed less concerned about Dobler. It was the coach's 52d birthday. He was presented with a 50-pound cake, in the shape of a football field, and he shared it with the players.\n\n---- Klecko Works Out Briefly\n\nJoe Klecko, the defensive end, is still hampered by a sprained left foot, but practiced for a few plays for the first time this week and then rested. Last week he practiced only one play and still produced 3 1/2 sacks in the game. He holds one of the two sacks achieved against the Bills' Joe Ferguson.\n\nThe game Sunday is a sellout and will be televised locally on Channel 4, starting at 1 P.M.",

One says one is writing the Great American Novel the same way one announces a midlife crisis, with a faint air of the ridiculous. And to call someone else\u2019s book the Great American Novel can only lead to skepticism, especially as we live in an age where all these terms \u2014 the, great, American, novel \u2014 seem rife with potential for doubt.\n\nInstead, I offer a great American novel which does not even seem to be a candidate. It is two books rather than one, neither of which are possibly even novels, their America balanced with other places: Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s \u201cThe Woman Warrior\u201d (1976) and \u201cChina Men\u201d (1980), a duo that she imagined could have been published as one volume. They mix one woman\u2019s story with those of her extended Chinese immigrant family, blending nonfiction and fiction, legend and oral storytelling, history and imagination.\n\nThese are different genres separated by walls of form, which separate, for example, a novel from a memoir. Kingston scales those walls to see what lies beyond them. Such an impulse is not only aesthetic. It also emerges among the most daring and imaginative people who have been confined by walls, or kept out by them, whether they be women, misfits or minorities of any kind. Kingston\u2019s writing deals with all three.\n\nFacing walls, the conventional response is to ask to be let in or let out; the unconventional response is to question the very existence and meaning of walls. In the first line of \u201cThe Woman Warrior,\u201d we are given a wall when the mother says to the daughter who writes the book, \u201cYou must not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.\u201d This command and injunction is a barrier that is destroyed in the same sentence that it is mentioned, as the writer reveals what she has been ordered to keep silent and secret.\n\nOur Critics at Large pick their Great American Novels\n\nOne of the unspoken silences of the Great American Novel is the assumption that it can only be written by white men. At least that is what the male-dominated literary establishment has historically told us, why some readers might only be able to name Melville, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Updike, Bellow or Roth, why it shocked me to see for the first time, at 18, a book by an Asian American in a bookstore: \u201cThe Joy Luck Club.\u201d For some readers, this is possibly a Great American Novel too.\n\nAmy Tan is Kingston\u2019s descendant, and in full disclosure, I was Kingston\u2019s student at Berkeley. But I was a bad student, a rebel who had not yet paid his dues. To be honest, I was also a young man unsteadied by strong women, and Kingston\u2019s books are indisputably feminist. I needed those books then, even if I did not know it. Giving us what we don\u2019t know we need, something we may even resist \u2014 perhaps that\u2019s one definition of greatness.\n\nNguyen is one of our Critics at Large",

Haig Jr. criticized the idea - endorsed by 17 senators and 122 representatives - in an appearance Wednesday on Capitol Hill. The State Department, in a more formal statement today, sought to align the Administration with proponents of arms control without accepting the plan.\n\nThe statement, read to reporters by Richard R. Burt, Director of Politico-Military Affairs, said President Reagan ''and his entire Administration share the concern felt throughout the world over the danger that nuclear weapons pose for mankind.''\n\n'A Credible Chance to Negotiate'\n\nThe statement then went on to argue that a freeze would put the United States at a military disadvantage because the Soviet Union had a lead in certain types of intermediate and intercontinental atomic weapons. It said a freeze would also deprive the Administration ''of a credible chance to negotiate a good strategic arms reduction agreement.''\n\nAnother senior official, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, told reporters this morning that the Administration was close to finishing its own deliberations on proposals to present to the Soviet Union when a new round of negotiations on reducing strategic nuclear arms begins.\n\nMr. Eagleburger said that in ''two weeks, three weeks or a month'' alternative proposals would be brought to Mr. Reagan for the opening American position at the talks on long-range atomic weapons. 'Overall East-West Climate'\n\nHe said the date for the start of the negotiations would depend on the ''overall East-West climate.'' But he was careful not to link a decision on beginning the negotiations to the Polish situation, saying the nuclear talks were not necessarily ''hostage'' to Poland.\n\nMr. Haig and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, had planned to set a date for the start of the strategic arms negotiations when they met in Geneva last January. But Mr. Haig, citing the crackdown in Poland, refused to agree on a date.\n\nTalks are continuing in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union on limiting intermediate-range, land-based nuclear missiles, although Mr. Eagleburger said today that no significant progress had been achieved.\n\nMr. Burt said a nuclear freeze would severely hamper the intermediate-range missile negotiations. ''We have embarked on a very important negotiation on intermediaterange nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union in Geneva,'' he said. ''The freeze proposal would concede to the Soviet Union its present advantage in intermediate-range nuclear missiles and thus eliminate any Soviet incentive to reach a thorough and balanced agreement that would reduce nuclear weapons in Europe.''\n\nThe American proposal, made public by Mr. Reagan last Nov. 18, calls for the elimination of the Soviet Union's 285 SS-20 missile launchers in Europe in return for cancellation of allied plans to begin building 572 modern missile launchers in Europe at the end of 1983.\n\n''While we understand the spirit that motivates the freeze effort,'' the statement said, ''the Administration cannot support the freeze itself.''\n\nMr. Eagleburger said he was ''very worried'' about the freeze proposal because it could add to the sentiment against nuclear weapons already present in Western Europe. U.S. Watching Polish Situation\n\nMr. Eagleburger refused to state the American conditions for the start of the strategic arms talks, but the Administration is clearly looking for some easing of the situation in Poland before committing itself.\n\nIn another matter, the State Department dismissed as ''hackneyed propaganda'' a pamphlet issued in Moscow in which Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov, the Soviet Chief of Staff, said the Soviet Union must keep its armed forces, economy and people in total readiness.\n\nCarolyn R. Johnson, a State Department spokesman, said, ''The Ogarkov pamphlet makes no new departures in its presentation of Soviet military strategy.''\n\n''I would not give too much weight to the notion that this pamphlet is evidence of a high-level policy debate on defense issues,'' she said. ''The pamphlet is a short, 72-page work and not a comprehensive reformulation of Soviet military policy.''",

Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. criticized the idea - endorsed by 17 senators and 122 representatives - in an appearance Wednesday on Capitol Hill. The State Department, in a more formal statement today, sought to align the Administration with proponents of arms control without accepting the plan.   The statement, read to reporters by Richard R. Burt, Director of Politico-Military Affairs, said President Reagan ''and his entire Administration share the concern felt throughout the world over the danger that nuclear weapons pose for mankind.''"

Trying to make the tackle is Rickie Harris. Photo was taken 10/31/1971.\n\nForrest Blue dies after years of dementia\n\nFormer 49ers center Forrest Blue, a first-round pick in the 1968 NFL draft who was a four-time Pro Bowl selection, died Saturday at 65 after spending the past decade-and-a-half with dementia believed to be connected to his playing career.\n\nBrittney Blue said her father's brain will be sent to Boston University where researchers are studying chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive degenerative disease linked to those who have sustained repeated head trauma. CTE is tied to memory loss, depression and dementia, and has been found in the brains of more than 20 former NFL players, including Bears safety Dave Duerson, 50, who committed suicide in February.\n\nThe brains of former 49ers running backs Joe Perry and John Henry Johnson also have been sent to Boston University after their deaths this year. Perry, 84, and Johnson, 81, endured severe memory loss in the years prior to their deaths.\n\nBrittney Blue said her father began having dementia-related hallucinations in the mid-'90s, and they became more frequent and elaborate about seven years ago. Mr. Blue, who worked as a general contractor in Rocklin (Placer County) after his playing career, spent the past 22 months at an assisted-living facility in Carmichael (Sacramento County), where he often talked about \"little people that lived in the walls,\" Brittney Blue said.\n\nShe said he also became extremely paranoid and believed people were using his contracting license to perform illegal work at the assisted-living facility.\n\nThe NFL's care for its retired players has been one of the issues discussed during the league's lockout. Ex-players have railed against inadequate pensions and medical benefits for years, and it appears their calls for reform were heard this week.\n\nOn Monday, NFL owners and the NFLPA reportedly agreed to add at least $900 million in benefits for retirees in the new collective-bargaining agreement. Of that total, $620 million is expected to be earmarked for the Legacy Fund, which benefits pre-1993 retirees.\n\nMr. Blue was covered under the 88 Plan, which provides up to $88,000 a year for ex-players dealing with dementia connected to their career. The plan was named in honor of Hall of Fame tight end John Mackey, 69, who died July 6 after being diagnosed with dementia in 2000.\n\nMr. Blue spent the first seven seasons of his 11-year career with the 49ers before playing with the Baltimore Colts from 1975 through '78. He was named to four straight Pro Bowls with the 49ers, 1971-74.\n\nMr. Blue, listed at 6-foot-6, 261 pounds by Pro Football Reference, thrived, in part, because of his size. Former 49ers tight end Ted Kwalick, who played six seasons (1969-74) with Blue, said his teammate was an imposing figure.\n\n\"Forrest was big back then, for that era,\" Kwalick said. \"He was a big center and he did a great job. I think he was really dominant. You take a guy like Forrest Blue and John Matuszak, who I played with on the Raiders - and these guys were 270, 280 (pounds). But they didn't have bellies. That was unheard of back then.\"\n\nBlue, who was married twice, is survived by two daughters, Brittney, 38, and Brandi, 40, and a grandchild, Micah, 16. A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. July 30 in Sacramento. For more information, call (916) 812-1353 or e-mail forrestblue49er@yahoo.com.\n\nE-mail Eric Branch at ebranch@sfchronicle.com.",

Its stock market debut is also likely to be the most scrutinized coming-out party since Facebook went public in May 2012 and promptly flopped.\n\nFacebook\u2019s follies made an impression on its social networking rival. Here are four signs of the Facebook influence on Twitter:\n\nLesson 1: Take the road less traveled.\n\nIPO submissions to the Securities and Exchange Commission typically include exhaustive financial information and other sensitive details. By taking advantage of the regulatory changes introduced since Facebook went public, Twitter is giving investors, the media, and would-be competitors less time to pore over its IPO documents.\n\nTwitter gained the wiggle room under a law passed last year shortly before Facebook completed its IPO. Called Jumpstart Our Business Startups act, the law allows a company with revenue below $1 billion to file its IPO papers with the SEC confidentially. This allows the documents to remain secret until 21 days before the company starts marketing the deal to investors \u2014 a ritual known as a \u2018\u2018road show.\u2019\u2019\n\nBy reducing the amount of time that its filing information is available for public review, Twitter is hoping to minimize the nitpicking over its business model.\n\nLesson 2: Work the numbers.\n\nTwitter is going public as a younger and smaller company than Facebook Inc., making it easier for the firm to get the kind of robust growth in revenue that may excite investors.\n\nFacebook had built such a large business by the time it went public that it was more difficult to speed its pace of growth from one quarter to the next. In its final year before going public, Facebook had annual revenue of $3.7 billion \u2014 about twice as much as Google did when it went public.\n\nResearch firm eMarketer estimates that Twitter had $288 million in revenue last year (the actual figure will be revealed in the company\u2019s IPO documents).\n\nBecause it still has a relatively small financial base, it won\u2019t be surprising to see Twitter\u2019s revenue more than doubling from the previous year for several quarters after its stock starts trading, PrivCo analyst Sam Hamadeh predicted in a research note.\n\nLesson 3: Leave some money on the table.\n\nTwitter won\u2019t price its IPO as aggressively as Facebook did, says Hamadeh. That increases the chances of Twitter\u2019s stock rising once it begins trading. He expects Twitter to set its IPO at a price that values the company at about $15 billion. That\u2019s up from an estimated value of $10 billion, based on the money Twitter has raised from venture capitalists and other early investors.\n\nLesson 4: Timing is everything.\n\nMany analysts thought Twitter might wait until next year to go public, but the stock market\u2019s appetite for social media companies has never been hotter. With the company\u2019s revenue growth picking up again, Facebook\u2019s stock has surged by more than 60 percent in less than two months. Meanwhile, LinkedIn Corp.\u2019s stock has more than doubled so far this year.\n\nThings are going so well that even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gotten over his one-time aversion to going public. In an about-face, Zuckerberg told a technology conference in San Francisco earlier this week that the IPO process turned Facebook into a better-run company.",

That's probably because it's basically a repackaged 2016 Infiniti QX80.\n\nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE.\n\nThe design of the two cars is almost identical, which is not entirely surprising given that Infiniti is the luxury arm of Nissan and, as they say, immitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nIf you're a fan of the QX80 but don't have the scratch to buy one, you're in luck because you'll now be able to get the same thing for $25,000 less.\n\nNissan tuned up the 5.6-liter V8 engine in the Armada, getting the horsepower up from 317 to 390 and increasing the torque from 385 lb.-ft. to 401 lb.-ft. It can also tow up to 8,500 pounds, which is the same as the 2016 QX80.\n\nGET THE LATEST NISSAN NEWS HERE.\n\nFor those Infiniti owners who are feeling a little bamboozled, try to take some solace in the fact that the QX80 has 400-horsepower and 413 lb.-ft. of torque, so you do getting a little extra performance bang for your luxury buck.\n\nThe new, eight-seat Armada is more than an inch longer and more than half an inch wider the the previous model, while also being about 2-inches closer to the ground.\n\nThe \"V-motion\" grille sets the 2017 Armada a part from both its predecessor and the QX80. The new SUV also features LED low-beam headlights with halogen high beams and LED Daytime Running Lights as well as air intake vents on the front fenders (which also are featured on the QX80).\n\nInside, the Armada comes loaded with a 13-speaker Bose systems and the premium package includes a standard DVD family entertainment system with dual 7.0-inch headrest monitors, two USB ports, two VTR jacks, two wireless headphones and a remote control.\n\nThe new Armada also comes loaded with airbags as well as a Lane Departure Prevention, Lane Departure Warning, Blind Spot Warning and Blind Spot Intervention to alert the driver of potential hazards on the road.",

About 50 people attended the party.\n\nProsecutors said Monday that they had reviewed the sheriff's findings and had concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to file charges.\n\n\"We looked at all the evidence, and we looked at all the potential elements of the crime,\" Assistant District Attorney David Tomkins said. \"We determined we could not prove them beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nNo one was arrested in the case, and investigators said several men questioned had described the sex as consensual.\n\nSheriff's Cmdr. John Hirokawa, who headed the investigation, said he was \"disappointed in the decision not to file any of the charges that were reflected in the reports.\"\n\nHirokawa declined to comment on how many people sheriff's investigators had recommended be charged.\n\nSteve Rebagliati, a baseball player at the Cupertino community college who lived in the home where the party was held, was cheered by the decision not to file charges, said his attorney, John Cahners.\n\n\"He's very excited,\" Cahners said. \"Hopefully, this whole dark cloud that's been hanging over him will go away.\"\n\nRebagliati was among several people at the party, including some De Anza teammates, who provided DNA samples to investigators and gave statements, Cahners and others said.\n\nSheriff's office officials had said in recent weeks that authorities were awaiting test results on the DNA to come back before deciding whether to file charges.\n\nTomkins declined to comment on any of the evidence in the case or what had led prosecutors to decide against charges.\n\nDe Anza suspended eight baseball players from athletics after the party for violating the team code of conduct.

Grand jury proceedings are secret, and Tomkins would not say whether prosecutors had sought an indictment.\n\nLegal experts said it appeared likely that prosecutors had seen limitations in their case after hearing some of the testimony play out before the grand jury.\n\n\"This is the way the system is supposed to work,\" said Barbara Babcock, an expert in criminal procedure and professor emeritus at Stanford Law School. \"One of the main things about a grand jury is it's secret, with a real chance to get to see whether the charges would stand up.\"\n\nRobert Weisberg, a law professor who heads the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, said cases involving allegations of rape or sex with a minor can present a host of problems for prosecutors, including whether the participants were intoxicated, whether there was consent and whether it could be shown in court that the suspects knew the alleged victim's age.\n\nSanta Clara County prosecutors aggressively charge rape cases, but \"this case just seems to have reasonable doubt written all over it,\" Weisberg said.",

Now, they are studying promising new treatments that may have general application, preventing heart disease by drastically lowering blood cholesterol levels.\n\nThe doctors, Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center here, are known locally as ''the gold dust twins'' for the many prizes and generous private support their work has drawn. Their investigations revealed that some people are born with an error in the signaling system that regulates cholesterol production within the body. The result - an overabundance of cholesterol in the blood - renders such persons highly susceptible to clogging of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and an early death from heart disease. It is the most common potentially lethal human genetic defect yet identified.\n\nThe research has enabled the scientists to detect in early prenatal life fetuses afflicted with the severest form of the defect, which usually causes death from a heart attack by the age of 15. And their ongoing studies into the elaborate mechanism that controls the production and distribution of cholesterol in the body are suggesting how diet can contribute to heart disease even in persons without this specific genetic defect.\n\nFurther, their studies indicate that an experimental new drug that greatly reduces blood cholesterol levels may lower heart attack risk even in persons who continue to eat rather large amounts of cholesterol. At the least, the scientists here say, the drug may finally lay to rest a major medical controversy by allowing a definitive test of the role cholesterol plays in heart disease in the general population.\n\n''For the first time, using this drug, it should be possible to reduce blood cholesterol levels enough to detect a significant lifesaving effect, if one exists,'' Dr. Goldstein noted.\n\nMore than 93 percent of the cholesterol in the human body is found inside cells, where it participates in such essential functions as the formation of cell membranes and the production of sex hormones, corticosteroids and bile acids.\n\nBut it is the remaining 7 percent that is the concern of millions of Americans and their physicians. For this is the cholesterol that circulates in the bloodstream, where it can stick to the walls of blood vessels and interfere with the supply of blood to the heart, brain and other tissues.\n\nCholesterol is an integral part of the tissues of all animals, including people, but it is absent in plants. It is a waxy alcohol that is soluble in fat but not in water.\n\n''Cholesterol is like a brick used to construct the wall between the inside and outside of a cell,'' Dr. Brown remarked. ''A brick can't be soluble -that's why it's so difficult for the body to handle.''\n\nFor cholesterol to be carried in the bloodstream, it must be attached to water-soluble proteins, known as lipoproteins, produced in the liver. Two-thirds of the cholesterol in human blood is carried by low-density lipoproteins, or LDL's, high levels of which are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Another form, the high-density lipoproteins, or HDL's, seem primarily to protect against heart attacks, perhaps by helping to clear cholesterol from the body.\n\nThe liver is the body's main cholesterol factory. Additional cholesterol enters the body through the eating of animal foods. In the absence of a supply from the liver or the diet, individual cells can manufacture cholesterol to fill their particular needs, but they prefer to use the cholesterol delivered to them through the bloodstream. Finally, cholesterol not used by the cells or deposited on the walls of blood vessels is excreted by the liver.\n\nDr. Brown and Dr. Goldstein had completed a medical residency program together at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and in 1968 they went to work at the National Institutes of Health. There they learned some sophisticated new biochemical techniques and were looking for a disease to study to put their skills to use.\n\nAs it happened, their lab was next door to that of Dr. Donald S. Fredrickson, former director of the National Institutes of Health, who was studying persons with abnormally high levels of cholesterol in their blood. The inherited disorder, called familial hypercholesterolemia, results in severe clogging of the arteries and early death from heart attack.\n\nOne in 500 persons inherits a single defective gene for this disease, and such a person is said to be heterozygous for the condition. Heterozygotes generally develop cholesterol levels of 300 to 550 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood serum, with clinical symptoms of heart disease appearing after the age of 30. Normal cholesterol levels range from 150 to 225 milligrams. One in a Million Occurrence",

Richmond of Brooklyn intervened with the Massachusetts Correction Commissioner on behalf of a prisoner who later escaped, according to new accounts by Massachusetts officials.\n\nIn a matter under investigation by a Federal grand jury, Mr. Richmond has said publicly that he helped the man obtain a clerical job in the House of Representatives last year. Mr. Richmond has repeatedly refused to say whether he knew that the man was a fugitive at the time. The convict was a former employee of the Congressman who was serving up to 18 years in prison for assault with intent to kill.\n\nNow a former Massachusetts Correction Commissioner, William T. Hogan Jr., has disclosed that three months before the escape, Mr. Richmond personally telephoned him to win a review of the prisoner's placement in Walpole Prison, a maximum-security facility.\n\nMr. Hogan, who was then Commissioner and is presently the Massachusetts Secretary of Human Services, recalled in an interview that within two days of Mr. Richmond's call such a review had been ordered and the Congressman was notified that the prisoner had been put on the waiting list for a medium-security facility.\n\nInstead the prisoner was subsequently transferred to a minimum-security Boston halfway house from which he escaped on July 22, 1980. While at large, the man - whom Massachusetts prison records call Earl Randolph but who worked in Congress and other places under the name John McLoughlin - was arrested in Manhattan on March 25, 1981. He was charged with soliciting an undercover police officer for an act of homosexual prostitution in a parked automobile belonging to Mr. Richmond.\n\nThe Congressman, whom the police reached at his home in Washington, acknowledged having given Mr. Randolph use of the vehicle. Massachusetts correction records list Mr. Randolph as having worked for companies associated with Mr. Richmond going back to 1972.\n\nFollowing the arrest here, fingerprint records revealed that Mr. Randolph -who has also used different Social Security numbers and dates of birth that give his age variously as 25 to 28 - was wanted on a Massachusetts escape warrant. After protracted extradition proceedings that are also under grand jury inquiry, Mr. Randolph was returned to Massachusetts last July and is serving the remainder of his term at the Southeast Correctional Center in Bridgewater. Involvement Not Disclosed\n\nThe account indicates that Mr. Richmond, a four-term Democrat, played a greater part in events involving the prisoner than previously acknowledged.\n\nIt also raises questions about how Mr. Richmond could have recommended the man for the Congressional job under the name of John McLoughlin when, according to Mr. Hogan, the Congressman had previously discussed the man under the name of Earl Randolph.\n\nAsked about this contradiction, Mr. Richmond's spokesman, Michael Kahan, again refused all comment. Mr. Richmond's Washington attorney, Walter Surrey, did not respond to several telephone messages. Mr. Randolph has also refused to be interviewed.\n\nAnyone who knowingly assists an interstate fugitive avoid apprehension is an accessory after the fact, a felon, under Title 18 of the United States Code.\n\nAccording to Mr. Hogan, who served as Massachusetts Correction Commissioner from January 1979 to September 1980, Mr. Richmond ''spoke favorably about Earl Randolph, whom I didn't know at all.'' Mr. Hogan said that it was unusual for a Congressman to call him personally on such a matter, but that he had agreed to look into it. However, Mr. Hogan said that upon checking the file, he was surprised to find such a ''negative'' picture. 'Completely Different' Portrayal\n\nMr. Richmond, he said, ''was picturing someone completely different from the picture of the person I was getting from the record - whether it was true or not, I had no way of knowing.''\n\nStill, Mr. Hogan recalled passing on the request for a review of the case to a deputy commissioner, Michael V. Fair, who is now Correction Commissioner. The matter was then passed on to the fourmember Department Classification Board, which voted 4-0 in May 1980 to transfer Mr. Randolph from Walpole to a minimum-security forestry camp at Warwick.\n\nWhen Warwick officials learned of the transfer, they protested to superiors, recalling problems from the prisoner's earlier stay there. ''He was rated as a potential escapee by many staff members,'' wrote Paul St. Amand, a Warwick official. ''He had an assaultive reputation, though never caught in the act here. Mr. Randolph mixed charm with hints of intimidation, a behavior he used to get his own way, as observed by our classification.''\n\nMr. St. Amand added: ''Mr. Randolph appears to have manipulative strength politically and has gained favors far beyond what his behavior warrants.''",

Richmond of Brooklyn intervened with the Massachusetts Correction Commissioner on behalf of a prisoner who later escaped, according to new accounts by Massachusetts officials.   In a matter under investigation by a Federal grand jury, Mr.  Richmond has said publicly that he helped the man obtain a clerical job in the House of Representatives last year. Mr. Richmond has repeatedly refused to say whether he knew that the man was a fugitive at the time. The convict was a former employee of the Congressman who was serving up to 18 years in prison for assault with intent to kill.    Now a former Massachusetts Correction Commissioner, William T.  Hogan Jr., has disclosed that three months before the escape, Mr.  Richmond personally telephoned him to win a review of the prisoner's placement in Walpole Prison, a maximum-security facility."

''I'm not saying she's not good, but I just don't know.''\n\nDespite doubts voiced by those such as Mrs. Murphy, Mrs. Conlin, a former United States Attorney, is the front-runner in a three-way race for the Democratic nomination for Governor in Iowa's primary Tuesday.\n\nBut in this largely conservative farming state, Mrs. Conlin has had to overcome several obstacles in seeking her party's nomination in a race against two formidable foes: Edward Campbell, a former state Democratic chairman, and Jerome Fitzgerald, the party's unsuccessful candidate for Governor in 1978. Present Governor Is Retiring\n\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face Lieut. Gov. Terry Branstad in November to determine who will succeed Gov. Robert Ray, a Republican, who is retiring after 14 years in the job. Mr. Brandstad, a conservative Republican, is running unopposed in his party's primary.\n\nGovernor Ray's retirement and a sour economy give Iowa Democrats their best hope in years of capturing the governorship. The major issue of the campaign has been the state's economy and ways to improve it.\n\nA month ago, The Des Moines Register's Iowa Poll showed Mrs. Conlin with a wide lead, being preferred by 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters. Mr. Fitzgerald followed with 24 percent, while 15 percent favored Mr. Campbell and 17 percent were undecided. But political observers say the race has tightened in recent weeks because of heavy advertising by Mr. Campbell and Mr. Fitzgerald.\n\nIn another recent poll most Iowans said it would not make any difference to them if a woman became governor. But in the same survey most said they thought it would make a difference to their neighbors.\n\n''I decided that if I wanted to be Governor, I would just have to do it as a woman,'' Mrs. Conlin has said. ''The alternatives are unacceptable.'' Helped Found Political Group\n\nMrs. Conlin, 37 years old, is one of the founders of the Iowa Women's Political Caucus and has been active in feminist causes in the state for several years. She was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa by President Carter and built a reputation as a tough prosecutor.\n\nPolitical strategists here attribute Mrs. Conlin's success to the fact that she started running nearly two years ago and to the many personal contacts she has developed. She also has gained the endorsement of the influential Iowa State Education Association, a teachers' union with 33,000 members, and the Iowa Federation of Labor.\n\nMr. Campbell, 47, a real estate businessman, served as a top aide to former Gov. Harold Hughes for several years. Mr. Campbell served five years as the state party chairman and has been endorsed by Mr. Hughes and former Senator John Culver.\n\nMr. Fitzgerald, 41, is a civil engineer and a former Peace Corps volunteer who served six years in the Iowa House of Representatives, where he was majority leader for four years. He won 42 percent of the vote against Governor Ray in 1978 and has been endorsed by several building trades unions in this year's campaign.\n\nMrs. Conlin said she has not been able to tap the usual Democratic sources of money and that her campaign suffers from a lack of cash. However, she has been able to match the spending of her two primary opponents by drawing on a large number of small contributors and by spending $64,000 of her own money to bankroll her $240,000 campaign budget.",

Davis circulated on the web. Of course it did, the situation is all too familiar; it happened in New York, Oakland, Berkeley, Portland, among other places. But this incident sparked an especially intense response.\n\nAs an alumna of the university, I was deeply saddened and shocked by the disturbing portrait drawn by police brutality on the campus grounds I once called home for four years.\n\nNathan Brown, a junior faculty member in the U.C. Davis Department of English and former professor of mine, wrote an open letter to Chancellor Linda Katehi. The letter has become a petition collecting over 65,000 signatures. In it, he held her accountable for the student injuries from the police incidents and demanded an immediate resignation:\n\nPolice used batons to try to push the students apart. Those they could separate, they arrested, kneeling on their bodies and pushing their heads into the ground. Those they could not separate, they pepper-sprayed directly in the face, holding these students as they did so. When students covered their eyes with their clothing, police forced open their mouths and pepper-sprayed down their throats. Several of these students were hospitalized. Others are seriously injured. One of them, forty-five minutes after being pepper-sprayed down his throat, was still coughing up blood.\n\nThis is what happened. You are responsible for it.\n\nThe debate on whether or not the chancellor is fully responsible and should resign is difficult to tackle. Katehi, who was clearly beleaguered and confused by the outrage projected against her, exited a press conference Saturday evening only to find herself greeted with the humming silence of protesters. In a video interview with U.C. Davis\u2019 AggieTV, she explains her reasoning for calling upon the cops to remove the students and protesters: \u201c[...] we were very concerned for using the quad for group discussions primarily because the group had been enhanced by non-students and individuals not affiliated with the university.\u201d\n\nKatehi also addressed her concerns for student safety on campus, plans to provide an outlet for student voices to be heard, and the university\u2019s ongoing plan for state support (to mend the huge wound created as they lost 40% of their state budget throughout the last four years).\n\nLast night, she sent out an apologetic email to the students, alumni, and friends of the university. \u201cI spoke with students this weekend and I feel their outrage. I am deeply saddened that this happened on our campus, and as chancellor, I take full responsibility for the incident,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe two police officers involved in the pepper spray incident were placed on administrative leave\u2013and for the right reasons: they failed to respond to the situation appropriately and instead reacted with violence. But is it anything new? Judging from the videos, it\u2019s hard to sympathize with Lieutenant John Pike\u2013the cop identified in the video (and now photo-shopped into many famous paintings). But over at The Atlantic, a writer takes a lesson from George Orwell and examines the authoritative nature of police officers, concluding that, well, Pike \u201cisn\u2019t a monster.\u201d\n\nStill, in light of all that has happened, once can\u2019t help but wonder: who is responsible for the chaos created by his actions?\n\nWhile Katehi authorized the police force to handle the situation, the outcome was a dual effort. She should have been able to foresee the consequences\u2013especially when they involve a cluster of protesters and police men in riot helmets, batons, and pepper spray. But perhaps the person who should be questioned is campus police Chief Annette Spicuzza\u2013who initially defended the police actions, claiming that they needed a clear exit from the protesters.\n\nA partial answer was revealed this morning, with the announcement of her administrative leave. As promised, however, further investigation will take place.\n\nThe Occupy protests are far from over and the recent punishments taken place in the university\u2019s police department haven\u2019t satisfied the angry protesters. But, if the recent events have taught us anything, it\u2019s that the next time a police officer pulls out a can of pepper spray in his hand, he\u2019s going to think twice before pushing that button.",

She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit.\n\nSource: Crown Prosecution Service\n\nBut Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter.\n\nMr Moores said: \"Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter?\n\n\"Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind.\n\n\"Our life is ruined.\"\n\nMrs Moores added: \"There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us.\"\n\nMs Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law.\n\n\"That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.\"\n\nA response to the Ministry of Justice consultation, which closes on 1 February, is due to be published by May.",

They had a new SUV in the driveway, a white Chevrolet Equinox.\n\nThey were happy, and even surprised with their happiness because it was from General Motors, and they never thought they would be buying a GM car.\n\nThe kicker: There was a three-month wait to get it from the dealer in New York City, where they also have an apartment.\n\nThree months! And they said no special deal, no price break. But they love their new Equinox.\n\nSo what's the problem? There aren't enough of these newish GM SUVs. On May 1, according to Automotive News, Chevy Equinox stock (the vehicles in dealer showrooms and lots and on the way) was 10,600 in the U.S., or a 23-day supply measured against the past month's sales. The sister GMC Terrain, a similar vehicle under a different looking skin, had 4,400 in inventory, or a 26-day supply. These small SUVs are built at a Canadian plant working overtime and assembling 4,000 a week. That's an annual rate of 160,000, clearly not enough for a hot market. The top three small SUVs--the Ford ( F - news - people ) Escape, Honda ( HMC - news - people ) CR-V and Toyota ( TM - news - people ) RAV4--accounted for more than 500,000 sales last year, and that was a terrible year for the industry. This year the leading seller is Ford's Escape and its sales are running 44% ahead of last year. The two GM entries have tripled their year-ago sales.\n\nFord has built 119,000 Escapes/Mercury Mariners this year while GM has rolled out 84,000 of the Equinox and Terrain, which is why Ford is outselling GM in this hot market.\n\nSo why doesn't GM build more? They probably are trying to figure out how. The Equinox/Terrain vehicles are built at one plant, and that's not likely to change. Adding workers, building up the line speed or going to a third shift mean more than putting a \"help wanted\" sign on the gate. There must be enough extra engines and transmissions, and paint shop capacity is always a problem.\n\nBut there's something else: Being short of cars isn't all bad.\n\nThe car makers have decided, at least for now, that lower inventories are better--better than building more than needed to keep factories going and then cutting prices to move the product.",

You just smear the Right-of-centre think tank that points it out as being politically motivated and biased against you. Even by the standards of the BBC \u2013 which has never been known to address (or even comprehend) criticism of its impartiality \u2013 this argument takes the biscuit.\n\nThe Centre for Policy Studies has published an impeccably researched report which offers objective statistical evidence of the BBC's persistent habit of describing (which is to say, effectively dismissing) the proposals of think tanks such as the IEA, the Centre for Social Justice, the Taxpayers' Alliance, and the CPS itself as emanating from \"Rightwing\" organisations, while offering up material from Leftwing or Labour-supporting groups without any such health-warning. The effect, needless to say, is to cast political suspicion on the published claims or policy suggestions of the outfits labelled \"Rightwing\", even when the material they contain is factual and empirically indisputable.\n\nSo how does the BBC respond to this? Do they say, \"This report contains serious allegations of bias which we will examine\"? Or perhaps, \"We understand that there is concern about lack of impartiality in our political news coverage, and we will consider the facts in this report seriously\"? No, they do not. Their tirelessly defensive spokesman simply points out that the CPS is (guess what?) a Right-of-centre think tank which has been known to campaign for the BBC to be reduced in size and question the continuation of the licence fee. So we can ignore whatever it says, then. Got that? The BBC is never wrong: it just has unscrupulous critics who \u2013 for some unfathomable reason \u2013 want to do it down. God in heaven. What idiot is it who decides on the Corporation's public relations policy?

But by tonight, the people of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island will finally be a substantial step closer to getting what Manhattan has had for a decade - cable television.\n\nToday, if all goes according to plan, a panel selected by the Board of Estimate will recommend which of the 13 companies that have been embroiled in the city's fierce contest for cable television franchises will survive the next round.\n\nThe Board of Estimate itself has scheduled a meeting on Dec. 10 to decide which of the companies should be selected for negotiation and is expected to award the franchises by next spring. Only then can the lengthy construction of the cable systems begin. It could take as much as eight years.\n\nBut the outcome of today's meeting of the Cable Working Group at City Hall could be considered the first formal step in a complicated, politically charged process unlike any other in the nation, mainly because of the city's size. An Unequaled Opportunity\n\nBrooklyn and Queens, for example, each has more potential subscribers than the largest cable system in the nation, San Diego's. So New York represents an unequaled opportunity to the winning cable companies, a potential that has not gone unnoticed among the influential lawyers, lobbyists and former city officials now affiliated with cable companies.\n\nNew York's franchising procedure itself is also unusual - ''unique,'' suggested Richard R. Aurelio, senior vice president of Warner Amex, one of the cable contenders - in another respect: the elaborate measures taken to prevent the appearance of impropriety and charges of political influence-peddling that grew out of the bus shelter scandal.\n\n''It's been a very careful process, very reasonable,'' said Mr. Aurelio, once the top aide to Mayor John V. Lindsay. ''But it always ends up with a political decision.''\n\nMindful of the lawsuits and indictments that have littered the trail of cable franchise awards in other cities, the Board of Estimate hired the Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter to guide the process. Board members also named key aides to a satellite committee - the Cable Working Group.\n\nIt is believed to be the only time that a single issue has spawned such a proxy group and led the city to invest so much influence in - and money on - an outside law firm to guide a project to realization.\n\n''In the end, this is a big insurance policy,'' explained Ellen Chesler, who represents Carol Bellamy, the City Council President, on the nine-member Cable Working Group. ''If somebody says, 'That decision was political,' we can say, 'The company met the standard in the Arnold & Porter report.' ''\n\nThe Washington law firm has been paid $775,000 to date and is to get $400,000 more. The city says it will pass along those costs to the franchise winners.\n\nThe firm has experience in the communications field, but has never been involved in a cable franchise process. Last month, the firm issued a 244-page report assessing the 21 plans submitted by 13 competing companies and making recommendations that are expected to form a contract guide.\n\nCiting the size of the boroughs and the cost of building the cable systems, the report suggested dividing Brooklyn into three cable areas, Queens into three or four and Staten Island into two. Only one proposal was submitted for the Bronx.\n\nMost of the companies submitted proposals for boroughwide systems, but they were aware that the city planned to determine the nature of all cable systems through negotiations.\n\nArnold & Porter also rated each cable package, placing major emphasis on financial factors. This has led to what some of the smaller companies contend is a bias in favor of large, national companies at the expense of those that are community-based. ''They did not evaluate smaller companies fairly,'' complained Lawrence J. Cormier, chairman of Gotham Communications, a company that is bidding in Queens and received poor ratings in the report.",

One official said that the food may not have been properly washed before it was cooked.\n\nThe children, between the ages of 5 and 12, got sick soon after eating lunch Tuesday in Gandamal village in Masrakh block, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the state capital of Patna. School authorities immediately stopped serving the meal as the children started vomiting.\n\nSavita, a 12-year-old student who uses only one name, said she had a stomach ache after eating soybeans and potatoes and started vomiting.\n\n\"I don't know what happened after that,\" Savita said in an interview at Patna Medical College Hospital, where she and many other children were recovering.\n\nThe lunch was cooked in the school kitchen.\n\nThe children were rushed to a local hospital and later to Patna for treatment, said state official Abhijit Sinha.\n\nIn addition to the 22 children who died, another 25 children and the school cook were in hospital undergoing treatment, P.K. Sahi, the state education minister. Three children were in serious condition.\n\nAuthorities suspended an official in charge of the free meal scheme in the school and registered a case of criminal negligence against the school headmistress, who fled as soon as the children fell ill.\n\nAngry villagers, joined by members of local opposition parties, closed shops and businesses near the school and overturned and burned four police vehicles.\n\nSahi said a preliminary investigation suggested the food contained an organophosphate used as an insecticide on rice and wheat crops. It's believed the grain was not washed before it was served at the school, he said.\n\nHowever, local villagers said the problem appeared to be with a side dish of soybeans and potatoes, not grain. Children who had not eaten that dish were fine, although they had eaten the rice and lentils, several villagers told the AP.\n\nSinha said the cooked food and kitchen utensils have been seized by investigators. \"Whether it was a case of negligence or was intentional, we will only know once the inquiry has been conducted,\" he said.\n\nIndia's midday meal scheme is one of the world's biggest school nutrition programs. State governments have the freedom to decide on menus and timings of the meals, depending on local conditions and availability of food rations. It was first introduced in southern India, where it was seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school.\n\nSince then the program has been replicated across the country, covering some 120 million school children. It's as part of an effort to address concerns about malnutrition, which the government says nearly half of all Indian children suffer from.\n\nAlthough there have been occasional complaints about the quality of the food served, or the lack of hygiene, the tragedy in Bihar appeared to be unprecedented for the massive food program.",

He denies the charge.\n\nHis closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nWith provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.\n\nHowever, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.\n\nThe BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.\n\nSome businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.\n\nThis has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta\n\nRaila Odinga\n\nProfile: Uhuru Kenyatta\n\nProfile: Raila Odinga\n\nSome electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.\n\nAt about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.\n\nIts website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.\n\nOur correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.\n\nMr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.\n\nLate on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.\n\nMr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.\n\n\"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nBut the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.\n\nAs there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that \"choices have consequences\".\n\nThe winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.\n\nIf there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.\n\nKenya elections: Maps and graphics",

Together, the Conservatives and Ukip could deliver the referendum on leaving the EU which more than 80 per cent of people want. Instead, the two parties are locked in a quarrel which reflects badly on all concerned.\n\nWhen Ken Clarke called Ukip \"a collection of clowns\", he was being unnecessarily rude \u2013 though no less rude, to be fair, than Ukip habitually is about him. Name-calling is rarely a way to win people over; nor does it impress neutral observers.\n\nPolitics is a rough game, of course, and we all sometimes lose our temper. I\u2019ve done so myself, and I apologise now to the people I\u2019ve been offensive about \u2013 including Gordon Brown. In this instance, though, Ken wasn\u2019t having a go at another politician; he was having a go at a large constituency of people in Britain.\n\nWhat is it, after all, that Ukip stands for? The same things as the Conservatives: lower taxes, independence from Brussels, an end to the human rights culture, localism. Above all, the party was established to give the British people a chance to leave the EU.\n\nWhat a paradox of cosmic proportions it would be if the reason that the country was denied such a chance was because of Ukip. How wretched we should all feel, the day after the 2015 general election, if we saw that there weren\u2019t quite enough MPs to deliver an In/Out referendum because of a split in the Eurosceptic vote.\n\nIf you think I\u2019m being fanciful, consider the recent Eastleigh by-election. Two Right-of-Centre candidates stood on virtually identical platforms. Both wanted an In/Out referendum, and both would have voted to leave. Between them, they secured 53 per cent of the vote, and lost, handing the seat to a Euro-integrationist Lib Dem with 32 per cent.\n\nImagine a series of Eastleighs around the country in 2015. Actually, you don\u2019t need to imagine. Think of the SDP-Labour split in the 1980s, or of the Reform-PC split in Canada in the 1990s.\n\nUkip strategists know they can\u2019t win a majority at Westminster. Indeed, most of them are honest enough to acknowledge that, even if given a clear run by the Tories, they wouldn\u2019t win a single seat at a general election. They do, however, have the power to determine who forms the next government.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a big fan of Nigel Farage. Though we\u2019ve fought each other at three European elections, he has been the most gracious and sincere of opponents. In an age when politics is dominated by careerists and trimmers, he is motivated by love of country.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, Nigel has said that Ukip is different from other parties. It isn\u2019t an end in itself, he says, but a means to an end. It exists only to give the British people their say on leaving the sclerotic and declining EU. I believe him. That\u2019s why Conservatives should be encouraging him to realise that vision.\n\nEvery party has its share of clowns: Ukip, the Conservatives, the Lib Dems and Labour. But there are many more well-intentioned people in Ukip who simply don\u2019t want to be governed by remote Euro-functionaries, nor to eschew the growing markets of the Commonwealth for the shrinking markets of Europe.\n\nEventually, there will have to be a Canada-style \u2018Unite The Right\u2019 initiative. But it took Canadian conservatives ten years to heal their breach; ten years during which the Liberals enjoyed huge majorities. Think of what Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, the men who drained our Treasury in the first place, could do in ten years. Think, and tremble.\n\nRead more by Daniel Hannan on Telegraph Blogs Follow Telegraph Blogs on Twitter",

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",

On Thursday, a Delhi judge refused to dismiss the dubious charges against Officer Manny Encarnacion.\n\nInstead, he put off a decision until at least July.\n\nIt raises a troubling question: If Washington can\u2019t get New Delhi to let an American police officer return home, why should anyone expect US diplomacy to triumph in places such as Ukraine or the Middle East?\n\nEncarnacion was nabbed on March 10 after security personnel at an Indian airport found three bullets in his jacket pocket.

Unfortunately for him, Indian pols were fuming because their diplomat, Devyani Khobragade, had been arrested here and strip-searched on charges of visa fraud and underpaying her maid.

Not some outlaw regime like North Korea (which is holding US missionary Kenneth Bae). Or Iran (which just sentenced ex-Marine Amir Hekmati to 10 years in prison and holds other US hostages as well). Or Cuba (where Alan Gross remains a prisoner).\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry has been jetting around the world\u2019s hotspots to get the Palestinians and Israelis to sign a peace deal, the Russians to stop invading their neighbors and the Iranians to give up their nukes.

Those defeats dropped Seattle to 3-3 and stirred skepticism about its once-ferocious defense, which allowed 401 yards of total offense against Tony Romo and Dallas.\n\nThat skepticism did not make it to December.\n\nThe 49ers will confront a rejuvenated Seahawks defense Sunday at notoriously raucous CenturyLink Field. Seattle has allowed only 20 points in its past three games, 19-3 victories over the Cardinals and 49ers followed by a 24-14 road win against the Eagles.\n\nThe Seahawks lead the league in total defense (274.5 yards allowed per game) and rank second in scoring defense (18.1 points per game, behind only the Lions). Yes, they\u2019re ferocious once more \u2014 not exactly what the 49ers and their sputtering offense need as they try to salvage their season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an experienced defense - these guys have been around and they\u2019ve played together a lot,\u201d Seattle head coach Pete Carroll said this week. \u201cThey can make sense of things with a glance or a word of what to expect, and that\u2019s a tremendously valuable asset.\n\n\u201cIt allows a team that plays a fairly basic scheme to play really fast. And if there\u2019s anything you should have witnessed here in the last month it\u2019s that our team speed picked up. You can see us playing faster, and that\u2019s in the continuity, communication and confidence from being together.\u201d\n\nThe Seahawks looked plenty fast on Nov. 27, when they throttled the 49ers at Levi\u2019s Stadium. San Francisco went nowhere on the ground (64 yards rushing), Colin Kaepernick was sacked four times and cornerback Richard Sherman intercepted two Kaepernick passes.\n\nKaepernick threw two more picks Sunday against the Raiders, so that\u2019s four interceptions in his past two games. The 49ers head to Seattle ranked 24th in the NFL in total offense and 27th in passing offense.\n\nIn the first matchup between these teams, the Seahawks didn\u2019t need exotic blitzes to put pressure on Kaepernick. As guard Alex Boone put it, succinctly, of Seattle\u2019s defensive line, \u201cThey\u2019re so good, they don\u2019t have to blitz.\u201d\n\nKaepernick again will operate behind a banged-up offensive line. Jonathan Martin will start at right tackle in place of Anthony Davis, who will miss his fourth consecutive game with concussion symptoms, and Joe Looney might replace Marcus Martin (knee) at center.\n\nJonathan Martin faces a challenging assignment against Michael Bennett, among other rotating Seahawks defensive linemen. Bennett has six sacks this season, including one against the 49ers, and a tendency to disrupt plays even when he doesn\u2019t reach the quarterback.\n\n\u201cI think his quickness really jumps out,\u201d Seahawks defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. \u201cHe could rush on all five offensive linemen (in practice) \u2014 that\u2019s how versatile he is for us when we do those kinds of drills. We put a lot on him and count on him to fill a variety of roles.\u201d\n\nOn a defense known mostly for its secondary \u2014 and, specifically, Sherman \u2014 Bennett counts as one of several standout players who doesn\u2019t wade in national headlines.\n\n\u201cOur D-line has been playing incredibly,\u201d Sherman said. \u201c\u2026I think it\u2019s the whole defense. All of us are just playing for each other and having a blast.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for Seattle\u2019s recent resurgence on defense: the return of middle linebacker Bobby Wagner. He suffered a turf-toe injury in the Week 6 loss to Dallas, missed five games and rejoined the lineup Nov. 23 against Arizona.\n\nNot coincidentally, that\u2019s when the Seahawks resumed smothering opposing offenses.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fast and he\u2019s smart,\u201d 49ers running back Frank Gore said of Wagner. \u201cAs a defense, they play great together. Every time you see a tackle, you see not just one guy but three or four guys around.\u201d\n\nBriefly: The 49ers also listed linebacker nose tackle Glenn Dorsey (forearm) and wide receiver Steve Johnson (knee) as out for Sunday\u2019s game. Marcus Martin and cornerbacks Tramaine Brock (hamstring) and Chris Culliver (knee) were among those listed as questionable. \u2026 Jonathan Martin hasn\u2019t played an NFL game in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s pretty loud,\u201d he said.\n\nRon Kroichick is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Not necessarily. Recent upbeat sales data, however, injected some long-absent optimism into the outlook.\n\nSales of previously occupied homes rose for three straight months at the end of last year. The glut of houses on the market is diminishing. And buyers are slowly regaining confidence.\n\nMajor improvement won\u2019t take place until next year, says the chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, David Crowe.\n\nMore important for investors, the big run-up in stock prices makes a correction likely. Homebuilding stocks have a history of declining after rising in the months ahead of the spring selling season.\n\nLow interest rates, affordable home prices, and pent-up demand should help the stocks rise. But the stocks are no longer cheap. Most are currently trading at roughly 1.5 times book value (the value of a company\u2019s assets if it were liquidated). Their current value suggests they are overpriced.\n\nWaiting for a pullback and buying after spring home-selling season, if the industry still has momentum, makes sense. That should put investors in position to profit from the coming rebound. Here are some stocks to watch:\n\n\u25a0D.R. Horton Inc. Its shares are up 74 percent since Oct. 3, but still about where they were two years ago. The company caters mostly to low-end buyers in 26 states. Analysts believe its broad customer base can help the company grow for years.\n\n\u25a0Lennar Corp.Morningstar says Lennar sits poised to reap major gains. Its revenue was up 12.5 percent and orders were up 21 percent in the fourth quarter. Lennar recently created a distressed real estate unit, Rialto, that allows it to obtain land more cheaply than its competitors. It also provides mortgage financing, title, and closing services. Its backlog of orders is 36 percent higher than a year ago. The stock is up 88 percent since October.\n\n\u25a0Toll Brothers Inc. It builds higher-priced homes in urban markets with job growth. That focus should enable the company to profit. Like Lennar, it has a distressed investment arm, Gibraltar, that helps it lock in prime land at bargain prices. It has modest net debt of just $400 million. Along with Lennar, it may be the best-positioned of the homebuilders, says analyst Jack Micenko of Susquehanna Financial Group. Toll Brothers shares are up 74 percent since October.\n\n\u25a0SPDR S&P Homebuilders. This exchange-traded fund includes seven of the largest builders. It also owns shares of companies that sell building materials. Many of the homebuilders are sitting on cash. That will allow them to expand. The fund is cheaper than the other homebuilder ETF, with an expense ratio of 0.35 percent, versus 0.47 percent for iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction.",

Read on.\n\nProfile: Boris Johnson\n\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\n\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\n\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\n\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\n\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\n\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\n\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\n\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\n\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\n\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\n\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\n\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\n\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\n\nNo, that's Donald Trump.

Ostheimer, a consultant who has studied the economy and its relationship to magazine advertising revenues. He said that when the gross national product dips, so do magazine revenues, but that the impact on magazines lags ''at the turning points, particularly on the upturns.''\n\nOn the same topic, James A. Oaks, director of communications for the Timken Company, said: ''We generally follow a broad turndown in the economy by six to nine months. The same holds true for an upturn in the economy. In my 24 years in the communications area of our company, I have never witnessed a direct correlation of our advertising funding to national economic trends. So far, we have been highly successful in what we are doing.''\n\nMarcella Rosen, senior vice president and media director of N.W. Ayer, observed that while the ''Seven Sisters'' of woman's magazines (Family Circle, Woman's Day, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, The Ladies' Home Journal, Redbook and Better Homes and Gardens) were down 5 percent, to a total of 443 ad pages for the first 10 months of 1981, what she called the ''seven little sisters'' (Bon Appetit, Health, New Woman, Parents, Self, Weight Watchers and Working Woman) were up 19 percent in ad pages, to 567, which, she said, ''more than offset the loss'' of the older crowd.\n\nStuart L. Sax, senior vice president, marketing and sales of Somerset Importers, which puts $12 million of the $221 million in distilled spirits advertising in magazines, said: ''When business is booming, yes, cost per thousand is important, but the decision maker is also willing to experiment, to buy what appears to be a new hot book, to be more receptive to environmental books, more easily sold on special interest books. On the other hand, when times are tough, the decision maker becomes a little more cautious, he plays it safe and even while spending the same number of deflated dollars or even more, he now does it more by the numbers.''\n\nRobert Alexander, assistant circulation director of Conde Nast Publications, probably raised a few hackles among the editors present when he suggested that since magazine covers are such a vital ingredient in single-copy (newsstand) sales, that ''we should have control of the covers, our package.'' This could raise problems with the editorial side, he acknowledged, suggesting that these could be overcome by ''relating the editor's bonus to newsstand sales.''\n\nAt another point, he noted that one of the real dangers faced by publishers of new magazines comes when the retailer gets a particularly heavy delivery of magazines that he must pay for that week. So, in order to cut down the bill, he sends back for refunds some titles that have not been selling even though there could be days to go before their off-sale dates. What is needed here, Mr. Alexander said, is broadcast promotion that will reach the retailer, as well as the consumer, convincing him that the new magazine can be sold.\n\nJohn I. Condon, vice president and general manager of the Men's Magazine Group of CBS Publications, who was on the same panel, spoke of subscription solicitation via television. As far as he is concerned, the 120-second unit (costing from $10,000 to $45,000 to make) is the minimum effective length for such commercials. And since their effeciency is judged by the ''cost per order,'' packages of commercial time bought from stations must be as cheap as possible.\n\nThis explains the puzzling appearance recently of commercials for such fairly highbrow publications as Time, Money and Fortune in some unlikely time slots on WOR-TV, Channel 9.\n\nSome of the other Palm Springs memories are more visual: the palm trees; the craggy peaks; John Kenneth Galbraith, toweringly-tall economist, doing a stately, slow backstroke across the hotel pool, and Victor Gotbaum, labor leader, man of the people and member of the ''productivity'' panel, at poolside with his wife enjoying a cool bottle of Mumm's champagne.\n\nAnd then there was the bright, warm sun - a sight to remember all winter long.",

Getting video from the \"edge of space\" seemed like an easy idea that would make for great television and a great story.\n\nIn the past few years, low-orbit photography \u2013 that is, taking photos and videos from high up in the atmosphere \u2013 has been growing as a hobby. As cameras and GPS devices become cheaper and more reliable, just about anyone can do it, not just tech geeks.\n\nMore from Light Years: 14-year-old gets photos from space\n\nFor our purposes, it seemed like a simple idea:\n\n1. Find low-orbit photography enthusiasts. Give them GoPro cameras and have them build a camera delivery vehicle with parachute.\n\n2. Launch cameras with weather balloon.\n\n3. Have cameras come back to earth with video so reporters could do stories for their home countries\u2019 television stations.\n\nAlso aboard the balloon were an Android phone and an APRS beacon \u2013 a system based on amateur radio \u2013 for tracking purposes.\n\nThe National Weather Service was kind enough to let us launch from its station in Peachtree City, Georgia. Do not launch a weather balloon without permission from the FAA or other appropriate aviation authorities!\n\nWe put together our payload, which became known as \"Yeager,\" and headed for an early-morning launch from a small airfield south of Atlanta. It was still very dark and quiet. The serenity jolted me into the reality of the moment. I had spent so much effort in planning and logistics, but I was really nervous. The journalists, though, were in high spirits as we launched the giant weather balloon. With surprising power and quickness, it rapidly ascended up from our cheers and out of sight.\n\nWell, here's where the \"crash\" part comes in. We suspect our balloon and parachute ran into some strong upper-level winds, and the whole apparatus broke apart. Thousands of dollars worth of equipment and man-hours crashed into central Georgia.\n\nMore on what went wrong\n\nWe did find our SPOT GPS unit attached to the parachute that was supposed to deliver our cameras safely. But the cameras had separated from the GPS unit.\n\nAfter the journalists and I gave up on finding the cameras, team members Mark Sudduth and Kerry Mallory continued the search. They looked in an area using the coordinates of our secondary tracking device, the APRS transmitter, which they were convinced had stayed with the cameras. They kept me updated with teasing phone calls reporting they were within 300 feet. But as the day dragged on, the heat, ticks and snakes, and deeply forested Georgia terrain got the best of them as night began to fall.\n\nAt the end of the day: No cameras, no video, no story.\n\nSix months later, miraculously, we did find the cameras \u2013 intact, with all video.\n\nBriefly, here's how they got recovered: The Android phone had separated from the space-bound package. But get this: The phone had sent a message to its owner with its whereabouts when the man who found it, Justin Garrett, turned it on. The phone had survived the fall, landing in Garrett's backyard in Brooks, Georgia, a tiny town about 35 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nThe Garrett house was the starting point for Mark and Kerry's subsequent search. At first, they didn't find anything else in that area, even after they realized that they had entered the coordinates of the cameras' location, as determined by the APRS transmitter, incorrectly into Google Earth.\n\nBut the weekend of December 15, Mark and Kerry went back to try once more. With summer's leafy foliage gone, they returned to the Garrett house and hiked toward the coordinates that the APRS transmitter had delivered before.\n\n\"I looked ahead and then it happened,\" Mark wrote on his website. \"As if to almost call out my name, I saw it. Through the woods, probably 200 feet away, I spotted the bright orange against an otherwise dull brown and gray backdrop of dormant trees and thicket.\"\n\nHere's more on how Mark and Kerry did it.\n\nIn the end we recovered all of our expensive equipment \u2013 intact and functional! \u2013 after its 12-mile free fall, got great video from the edge of space, which we sent to our international reporters, and wound up with even a better story than we anticipated.",

But it was wrong for financial institutions to prey on those desires with unbalanced financial solutions.\n\nLong before the recession hit, as the senior pastor of a multicultural congregation in Dallas, Texas, I had implemented financial management programs through our nonprofit, the Metroplex Economic Development Corporation, so people could learn the fundamentals of credit and debt management. I wanted our community to be financially empowered and to think in terms of handing down more than debt to the next generation.\n\nI believe that it is the responsibility of the church to take on the next frontier of civil rights: education and economic empowerment to close the widening gap between minorities and the overall population.\n\nAt The Potter's House, we've taken our efforts up a notch by meeting with banks and negotiating better terms for our demographic. We've challenged national lenders to effectively \"come correct\" in their practices that put home ownership and the purchase of a car for work out of reach for most. The church has certainly come a long way from a place of being \"so heavenly minded and no earthly good,\" to leading the charge toward financial freedom.\n\nI am well aware that a religious leader speaking on the subject of money runs the risk of being branded a prosperity preacher, but I've never cared much about labels.\n\nI am far more interested in demystifying the concepts of money management and introducing the truth: It takes a combination of education and economics to set people free.",

A ranking diplomatic observer said that he expected the Russians and their Eastern-bloc partners to intensify pressure on the Poles to curtail the influence of Solidarity, the independent trade union movement, up to the time of the party congress, which is scheduled for nextJuly.\n\n''If the Poles themselves fail to take decisive action by the time the congress convenes, it is obvious the bloc is preparing for other drastic steps,'' he said.\n\nAt the East German congress here last month, party officials said that the Poles should be given a respite to seek a ''political solution for their troubles.'' But the moderation shown then has quickly given way to fresh bursts of disaffection, hostility and doubt.\n\nToday's East German report spoke of the ''extreme worry'' with which the appearance of ''hostile factions'' within the Polish party was being registered. It saw a ''basic, potential danger'' in plans to change the party. The East German report followed a series of similar attacks in Soviet newspapers, duly reprinted in this country's Communist press.\n\n''There are plans to change the party structure, and create a different party, a social democratic, loosely knit organization that would be free of centralism and would adopt a pluralistic stand,'' the East German report said. Only ''total rebuff'' of such dangerous developments, it added, could solve the Polish crisis. No Tolerance of Deviation\n\nThese remarks indicated that Poland's Eastern-bloc partners are not willing in the long run to concede the country any large-scale deviation from the path of Soviet Communism.\n\nThe East German report, the most detailed criticism of events in the neighboring country since last winter, said the Polish economy was faced with unemployment of up to 1.5 million people and plagued by food shortages that were getting worse despite rationing.\n\nSolidarity, the report said, is acting more and more ''audaciously'' in giving free rein to counterrevolutionary forces and in setting up ''its own supreme rule,'' to which all other groups are supposed to subordinate themselves. ''Only a naive fool can still believe Solidarity is a labor union,'' the East Germans said.\n\nThe report said that crime was on the rise in Poland, that police and security officials were being publicly attacked and that general destabilization had intensified.\n\n''No way seems to be in sight,'' the East Germans concluded, ''to combat a situation in which the leading role of the party is being undermined, in which the state authorities are being made to disintegrate through the counterrevolutionary forces of Solidarity and in which the economy is on the brink of collapse.''",

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",

Elmo, ending months of unprecedented secrecy that's had the toy industry abuzz. Until the unveiling, only about 50 people had seen it.\n\nPredicted to be a hot holiday seller, the new and improved Tickle Me Elmo made its debut on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" as customers lined up at Toys \"R\" Us, Wal-Mart and KB Toys.\n\nThe \"X\" in T.M.X. stands for extreme.\n\n\"When I originally saw a picture of how it moves, I really thought there were some sort of wires, like a puppet, moving it,\" said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Toy Wishes, a trade publication. \"We've never seen a stuffed animal that has this type of movement.\"\n\nThe debut of T.M.X. Elmo was timed to the 10th anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, the must-have toy of Christmases past that giggled when its stomach was pressed. In the new version, Elmo's squeaky laugh and body movements grow more pronounced with three successive tickles.\n\nMattel president Neil Friedman had been president of Tyco Toys, now a unit of Mattel, when it launched the original Tickle Me Elmo, which had parents of preschoolers elbowing each other in the aisles.\n\n\"With today's technology, this one is even more incredible,\" Friedman said. \"You really have to see it to believe it.\"\n\nExecutives at KB Toys Inc. and Toys R Us Inc. said pre-orders for the toy, which retails for $39.99, have exceeded expectations.\n\nSilver expected demand to be high, not only for the buzz and novelty, but because the advanced technology could limit the number produced.\n\n\"If there are Elmos around December first, I will really be surprised,\" said Silver. He said the excitement built by the stealth marketing will be good for the entire toy industry, which has struggled in recent years as children have sought out video games and other gadgets at a younger age.\n\nBefore Tuesday, the Fisher-Price Web site pictured T.M.X. Elmo only in shadow. Much of East Aurora-based Fisher-Price's own sales staff had not been allowed to see T.M.X. Elmo, even when they pitched it to retailers.\n\nEach year since the original Tickle Me Elmo, the company has come up with another incarnation with a new skill like doing the Chicken Dance or Hokey Pokey or singing Rock 'n Roll.\n\nMattel Inc., the world's largest toy maker, in July reported a second-quarter profit due to reduced tax expenses. Gross sales for the Barbie brand slipped 1 percent, while Hot Wheels sales fell 7 percent and Fisher-Price sales rose 10 percent.",

That made them all second-prize winners, and considering the number of tickets sold in the 29 states where the game is played, there should have been only four or five.\n\nBut from state after state they kept coming in, the one-in-three-million combination of 22, 28, 32, 33, 39.\n\nIt took some time before they had their answer: the players got their numbers inside fortune cookies, and all the cookies came from the same factory in Long Island City, Queens.\n\nChuck Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs Powerball, said on Monday that the panic began at 11:30 p.m. March 30 when he got a call from a worried staff member.\n\nThe second-place winners were due $100,000 to $500,000 each, depending on how much they had bet, so paying all 110 meant almost $19 million in unexpected payouts, Mr. Strutt said. (The lottery keeps a $25 million reserve for odd situations.)\n\nOf course, it could have been worse. The 110 had picked the wrong sixth number -- 40, not 42 -- and would have been first-place winners if they did.\n\n\"We didn't sleep a lot that night,\" Mr. Strutt said. \"Is there someone trying to cheat the system?\"\n\nHe added: \"We had to look at everything to do with humans: television shows, pattern plays, lottery columns.\"\n\nEarlier that month, an ABC television show, \"Lost,\" included a sequence of winning lottery numbers. The combination didn't match the Powerball numbers, though hundreds of people had played it: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. Numbers on a Powerball ticket in a recent episode of a soap opera, \"The Young and the Restless,\" didn't match, either. Nor did the winning numbers form a pattern on the lottery grid, like a cross or a diagonal. Then the winners started arriving at lottery offices.\n\n\"Our first winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie,\" said Rebecca Paul, chief executive of the Tennessee Lottery. \"The second winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie. The third winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie.\"\n\nInvestigators visited dozens of Chinese restaurants, takeouts and buffets. Then they called fortune cookie distributors and learned that many different brands of fortune cookies come from the same Long Island City factory, which is owned by Wonton Food and churns out four million a day.\n\n\"That's ours,\" said Derrick Wong, of Wonton Food, when shown a picture of a winner's cookie slip. \"That's very nice, 110 people won the lottery from the numbers.\"\n\nThe same number combinations go out in thousands of cookies a day. The workers put numbers in a bowl and pick them. \"We are not going to do the bowl anymore; we are going to have a computer,\" Mr. Wong said. \"It's more efficient.\"",

The compositions \u2014 airy and atmospheric, but possessed with a sense of forward motion \u2014 flowed from him over the course of two inspired weeks.\n\n\u201cUsing these episodes of the book helped me get out of my own way, as far as not thinking in abstract musical terms. It helped me to turn a corner, to a thing that I wanted to get to anyway. Once I started writing one song about it, I could sort of see the whole thing,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere aren\u2019t very many super-complicated kinds of structures in it. But hopefully each piece does have its own mood, its own kind of emotional space.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll feature songs from the album in a quartet performance at Regattabar on Thursday, alongside double bassist Larry Grenadier, drummer Nate Smith, and David Virelles, whose prepared piano, celeste, and harmonium add much to the record\u2019s textures.\n\nPotter, 42, first emerged on the scene as a teenage wunderkind in the band of trumpeter Red Rodney, a first-generation bebopper with credits in Parker\u2019s quintet. It was an apt apprenticeship. Potter\u2019s style on tenor sax is both rooted in bebop fundamentals and considered one of the most original among his generation of players.\n\nA generous collaborator, he\u2019s recorded notable sideman work in Pat Metheny and trumpeter Dave Douglas\u2019s groups, among others. His electric group Underground explores some more fusion-minded territory, and he\u2019s written for big band and orchestra environments as well. The new record is his first as a leader for influential German label ECM.\n\nPotter was attracted to his source material by its combination of mythic themes and very human stakes. It\u2019s easy to find a connection there, he says, whether you\u2019re a professional musician out on the road for long spells, or simply working toward a goal closer to home.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a foregone conclusion that Odysseus is going to make it home. There are all these things that could have happened, and he would have lost his way and that would be it. I think that\u2019s something that we all can relate to. There\u2019s a million ways to get lost. And if you manage not to get lost, that in itself is kind of a heroic feat,\u201d he opines.\n\nBut no footnotes are needed to enjoy the new material. (\u201cI\u2019d be perfectly happy if whoever\u2019s listening invents their own story for it,\u201d Potter adds.)\n\nThe improv in \u201cWayfinder,\u201d a portrait of Odysseus, has a searching, carefully exploratory manner evocative of the hero\u2019s 20-year journey and long-delayed efforts to return home. The album has a few touches of the more literal sort, like the martial tilt to a bass line in \u201cStranger at the Gate\u201d suggesting the bearing of a soldier, but it is mostly a series of mood poems inspired by Homer\u2019s original.\n\nECM founder Manfred Eicher, who produced \u201cThe Sirens,\u201d says he wanted Potter to lead a session for him after listening to his work in the late drummer Paul Motian\u2019s band.\n\n\u201cHe has a very personal way of phrasing, a wonderful kind of intonation. He\u2019s as beautiful in ballads as in the uptempo pieces. And I believe he also has something to say as a writer,\u201d Eicher remarks of Potter. \u201cHe has his personal voice, which he\u2019s developed in recent years, quite amazingly I think, by playing with so many different people. He\u2019s at home in many kinds of territories.\u201d\n\nPotter likens that process to having conversations with a range of different people.\n\n\u201cYou might wind up bringing up different ideas or expressing them in a different way depending on who you\u2019re talking to and what the subject is. But I don\u2019t really feel like I should play in a particular bag given what the project is. It\u2019s more about finding out how my voice can work in different settings,\u201d he says.\n\nWith the current project, his quest continues \u2014 taking inspiration from the greats who came before, but filtering that into a wholly original statement.\n\n\u201cIt always seems that it\u2019s impossible to get away from yourself anyway, so you always bring that with you wherever you go.\u201d",

But I recall the writer pointing out that Jenks career path consisted of fewer saves every major-league season and some rotten numbers outside of the Sox\u2019s turnaround month this year.\n\nYes, I recall someone writing that sort of prescient, insightful blog as the trade deadline approached, and I wish I could remember who it \u2013\n\nSorry, I\u2019m old, and sometimes the memory goes. Glad I remembered it, though. Glad to be able to feed the haters, too.\n\nTangent: My smug, arrogant, smarmy attitude has prompted me to start a social networking medium called Hater. The idea is to provide more people with more ways to register their utter, complete and searing loathing for everything me. Most people you follow on that other social networking thingy are not that interesting, and it\u2019s disappointing and frustrating when you have to pay attention to some dope who writes, \u201chi world am up lif iz gud.\u2019\u2019 Iz stooped, actually. But imagine how satisfying it would be to be able to randomly curse at me as the moment strikes. I can\u2019t provide examples here because we\u2019re a family blog, but given the experience I have with my loving audience, I really don\u2019t think the crowd needs a primer. Hater has possibilities, I\u2019m telling you, and not just with the idea of venting at me. Link your account to Lovie Smith, Tommie Harris, Bobby Jenks --- OK, end of tangent. Back to the Sox.\n\nOn Wednesday night in Seattle,\n\nin a second straight save situation in a second way on this 10-game trip.\n\nTo review, on Sunday in Minnesota, he choked away a three-run lead that would\u2019ve given the Sox a split in the four-game series. He had nothing, and the Sox paid for it.\n\nOn Wednesday night against the Mariners, Jenks was beaten by a smarter plan at the plate and his own stupidity from the stretch. Jack Wilson bunted his way on, then went to third on a single by Chone Figgins, who immediately stole second before Franklin Gutierrez ended the 11-inning affair with a two-run single. Quick, someone tell Jenks those people in the baselines are not his imaginary friends.\n\nSox manager Ozzie Guillen said Jenks had nothing on his fastball. Did so, said Jenks, claiming his perceived dip in velocity was a result of throwing all those sinkers, which leads to the conclusion that he doesn\u2019t have a fastball anymore. I know closers are supposed to have short memories, but how about a grasp of reality?\n\nTo recap the last two outings, Jenks couldn\u2019t get the hitters, couldn\u2019t pay attention to the runner, couldn\u2019t get the saves. What else you got?\n\nWhatever, that was enough for Guillen. The job\u2019s open, he said. All options will be explored. J.J. Putz has done it before, and what\u2019s more, he hasn\u2019t allowed an earned run since, jeez, I don\u2019t know, since Bobby Thigpen closed. Something good like that. Matt Thornton has the stuff, as well.\n\nBut if I\u2019m Kenny Williams, I\u2019m looking for a closer and calling around, and the place I\u2019m calling is Kansas City.\n\nRoyals\u2019 All-Star closer Joakim Soria had been rumored to the Yankees before Andy Pettitte went down and\n\nThe cost reportedly is at least one Major League-ready player and several prospects. The cost likely would be higher for a division rival such as the Sox, and you\u2019d have to wonder how many prospects Williams has left, but Soria is where I\u2019d start.\n\nAnd probably end, too, because the names I\u2019ve heard --- David Aardsma, Kevin Gregg, Octavio Dotel, Trevor Hoffman --- make we want to go deaf.\n\nBut again, I\u2019d do the closer before I\u2019d do a left-handed bat, and another thing: What\u2019s the panic and breathlessness over\n\nIf the Sox thought they needed a left-handed power bat so badly, they would\u2019ve kept Jim Thome. But Guillen didn\u2019t want that kind of team. He wanted a roster where he could play toy soldiers. He wanted to stress pitching and defense and timely hitting.\n\nWhich is exactly what rocketed the Sox to a 25-5 record and sole possession of first place before the All-Star break, a lead they have extended to 2\u00bd games even after Jenks\u2019 handiwork. Guillen\u2019s plan is working. Why screw it up by changing the approach so dramatically? Fix the ninth inning, or the 11th or whatever. Don\u2019t fix what\u2019s working. Connect the dots, people.\n\nAnd until I get that Hater thing working, you\u2019ll have to settle for posting comments here.",

A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for \u00a3140,000.\n\nSo what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies.\n\nThe rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment.\n\nFanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none.\n\n'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time,  unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.'\n\nWith the same amount of money that the handbag costs, you could splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante.\n\nWhilst they don't own the exact same bag, Kim Kardashian, left, and Heidi Klum, right, are both the proud owners of pink Hermes Birkin bags.\n\nHermes is one of the most coveted handbags of all time, but with a price tag of around \u00a38,000 the Herm\u00e9s Birkin bag isn't quite within every fashionista's price range (unless you're Victoria Beckham whose collection is worth a reported \u00a31.5m).\n\nPrestigious luggage and accessories firm Herm\u00e9s, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as fans, is known for luxury leather accessories.\n\nRenowned for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Herm\u00e8s claims never to use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time, hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product.\n\nThe brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have intriguing stories behind them.\n\nThe iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most popular styles, was originally known as the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935.\n\nIn 1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches to hide her pregnancy.\n\nPhotographs were sent all over the world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since.\n\nVictoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth \u00a31.5m.\n\nThe Birkin has similarly romantic roots, conceived as it was in honour of French star Jane Birkin.\n\nThe Birkin was allegedly created after the company's CEO Jean Louis Dumas sat next to the actress on a Paris to London flight.\n\nBirkin had been discussing her difficulty in finding a leather weekend bag, explaining her ideal.\n\nShortly after, in 1984, the bag she described arrived at her flat with a note from Dumas. Although nowadays the bag can be made to order, the design is still one of the most recognised in the fashion industry.\n\nAnd Victoria Beckham isn't the only celebrity Birkin fan.\n\nBritish-born author Barbara Taylor Bradford owns an impressive 24 and heiress Tamara Ecclestone has specially built cupboards to house her \u00a3100,000 collection.\n\nKatie Holmes, Julia Roberts, Hilary Duff and Kelly Brook are also fans while Jane Birkin, the inspiration behind the roomy leather must-have has said she covers her 'b***** heavy' Birkin with stickers to disguise the fact she's carrying a 'snobbish' bag.",

'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.'\n\nA stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event.\n\nMendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre.\n\nMendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield.\n\nAnticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.\n\n'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.'\n\nLamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.\n\nMeanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.\n\nWatch UFC Fight Night: Mendes vs. Lamas live on BT Sport 1 on Saturday, April 4.

Multiple-quarterback systems have rarely succeeded on a consistent basis in college football, and Maryland won\u2019t be testing that model anytime soon despite its push to stockpile talent and competition at the position over the past nine months.\n\nBell has found his starter in senior Perry Hills, who won the job in August for a second straight season and had one of the more efficient games of his career in last Saturday\u2019s season-opening win over Howard. He completed his first 10 passes and looked in comfortable command of Bell\u2019s up-tempo spread, finishing 14 for 19 for 126 yards. The most impressive statistics? Hills didn\u2019t turn the ball over and the offense didn\u2019t commit any pre-snap penalties, operating at the kind of clean, rapid pace that Bell has demanded of his unit.\n\n[With JC Jackson in limbo, former walk-in steps in for Maryland football]\n\nBut Maryland fans also received a glimpse of the electrifying talent of true freshman Tyrrell Pigrome, who entered in the third quarter and engineered a touchdown drive on the first series of his career. He finished 4 for 6 for 63 yards and ran for another 56 yards on seven attempts, which included perhaps the highlight of the day, in which Pigrome juked a Howard defender out of his shoes and sprang free into the open field for a 25-yard run. That triggered questions about whether the staff would consider a rotation, complementing Hills with the skill set of Pigrome. Bell quickly shot that notion down when he met with reporters on Wednesday.\n\n[Why freshman quarterbacks are taking over college football]\n\n\u201cNo, absolutely not,\u201d Bell said when he was asked about the possibility of running a two-quarterback system. \u201cPerry Hills is the starter. He will be the starter until he renders himself not the starter. I think one of the things that is truly important for the quarterback position is that you play it confidently \u2026 the demeanor in which you play that position, from a command aspect, from a decisive, decision-making standpoint, you can\u2019t do either of those two things if you got somebody coming in there to replace you all the time.\u201d\n\nPlaying quarterback in Bell\u2019s system is \u201ca lot like being a volume-puncher in boxing,\u201d he said, because it forces Hills to be economical. He is managing the line of scrimmage and lining up his teammates in formations at a speed he had never experienced in his four previous years in College Park, and on that end, his performance against Howard was mostly clean. By the game plan\u2019s design, he didn\u2019t take many shots down the field. He mostly worked intermediate routes \u2014 Hills completed seven balls for 11 yards or more, with his longest completion measuring 19 yards \u2014 and he logged just one carry. A year after he had one of the most successful seasons running the football as a quarterback in school history \u2014 he finished with 570 yards, good for fourth all-time \u2014 Hills might not be the flashy runner that Pigrome is, but he\u2019s capable of pounding the ball in between the tackles and on the perimeter.\n\n[Twin brothers Elijah and Elisha Daniels share in Maryland football\u2019s youth movement]\n\nBell expects to use Hills\u2019s improved athleticism more on the ground as the season progresses, but the first week was an exercise in restraint and an uptick in explosive plays are expected as the unit\u2019s efficiency improves on first downs. In 18 first-down plays under the direction of Hills, Maryland averaged 6.9 yards per clip. Hills went 8 for 9 passing for 63 yards on first downs.\n\n\u201cIt makes it a lot easier. Third and long, those are only completed about 25 percent of the time,\u201d Hills said. \u201cWhenever you can get yourself into third and short, or just keep getting first downs, it makes it a lot better as an offense.\u201d\n\nBell also maintained that Pigrome is a \u201cvery unique character,\u201d and didn\u2019t rule out building special packages to use the true freshman in down the road. But his percentage of error at the line of scrimmage remains high, Bell said, and the staff is continuing to help Pigrome adjust to the speed and complexities of the college game. The position has also been bolstered by the return of senior quarterback Caleb Rowe, who is inching back to full health and returned to the two-deep this week. Rowe is listed as a co-backup along with Pigrome and fellow true freshman Max Bortenschlager, but Bell is riding with Hills as his entrenched starter unless circumstances dictate otherwise.\n\n\u201cIt was very refreshing to see him smile and have fun,\u201dBell said, \u201cand just play.\u201d",

VZ -1.92 % is scheduled to report financial results for the fourth quarter before the market opens Jan. 21. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nEARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect earnings per share of 88 cents, up from 71 cents during the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nREVENUE FORECAST: Analyst are expecting revenue of $34.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters, up about 2.7% from the same period last year. Analysts estimate full-year revenue of $131.5 billion, compared with $127.1 billion in 2014.\n\nCOMPETITION: Sprint Corp. S -13.26 % punched hard in the fourth quarter with an aggressive half-price offer. Whether Verizon can maintain strong subscriber growth in spite of this will be notable, especially considering 4Q is typically brutal because many two-year contracts come to an end and customers are up for grabs. Analysts at Wells Fargo predict the carrier will still net a strong 1.5 million postpaid subscribers. Meantime, service revenue could come under pressure after Verizon stopped offering two-year contracts to new customers. That is because rather than selling cellphones at a subsidized discount in exchange for a two-year contract, Verizon now lets customers pay off their cellphones\u2014at full price\u2014over time, which in turn produces lower wireless service revenue due to an accounting quirk.\n\nVIDEO: Verizon launched its mobile video app, Go90, in October, and it still hasn\u2019t given any metrics on adoption. The company has continued to add content deals, recently with Sony Music and the National Basketball Association. But investors will be looking for any details about the app\u2019s traction.\n\nSPECTRUM: Verizon has said it would participate in a coming government auction of wireless airwaves, but it hasn\u2019t given much color on how much it will spend. There is also another trove of airwaves out there for the taking. FirstNet, which is a nationwide public safety network, needs a carrier partner and that partner would get access to its spectrum. All the national carriers would be logical partners. FirstNet issued an request for proposals recently, but Verizon hasn\u2019t said for sure whether it plans to apply.\n\nYAHOO YHOO -5.21 % : Yahoo is considering alternatives for its core Internet business including a sale, and Verizon has expressed interest.

Tight end Vernon Davis? He has eight targets in the past three games.\n\nIt's hard to argue with Kaepernick's pecking order, given the results.\n\nIn a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards. Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn't designed for San Francisco's No. 1 wide receiver.\n\nIn his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.\n\nIn his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.\n\nOn KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he'd ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.\n\n\"Yeah, I think there is,\" Harbaugh said. \"But Michael has been doing this all year now. Talked about it every week, the ability to catch, nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree. I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic. It might have even been on this show. A lot of people 'What? The greatest hands you've ever seen?' Nobody mentions that any more. Boy, the evidence sure is there.\"\n\nWith at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.\n\nDavis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick's first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.\n\nDavis said he's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.\n\n\"You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,\" Davis said. \"That's something me and Kaep don't have right now.

Me and Alex, we've been here.\"\n\nAsked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page, Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes. However, he also noted, as Kaepernick did Sunday night, that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage.\n\n\"Crab is a pretty good route runner,\" Davis said. \"He's getting open and Kaep is finding him.\"\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

            "answer": "Termed a &quot;man of enough words&quot; recently by Jim Harbaugh, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick needed just three syllables Sunday to explain why wide receiver Michael Crabtree has emerged as his favorite target.  In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday, Crabtree (7 catches, 107 yards, 2 TDs) was featured on the 49ers' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards.  In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game.  Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.  According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick's starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.  With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002."

The road to Europe is the only route that will help our country solve its considerable problems and build a lasting peace and stability throughout the region. It is difficult to imagine that any economic or political renewal can occur in Yugoslavia without unambiguous and long-term international support.\n\nOnly a democratic and stable Yugoslavia can secure stability in the Balkans. We want to underscore that the democratic political forces in Yugoslavia are committed to that goal. The immediate concerns are ending the war, securing the return of the refugees and implementing a political settlement in Kosovo that will include the deployment of an international force.\n\nBut to establish a lasting peace, the outside world needs to do more than solve the Kosovo crisis. Military intervention in Kosovo has led to new problems, whether or not that was intended. With intervention, the West assumed part of the responsibility for finding solutions to these problems.\n\nAt the same time, intense efforts will also be necessary on the part of Yugoslavs to win the trust of the outside world and recover the moral standing lost because of Kosovo.\n\nEven before the end of the war, the international community should state clearly and unequivocally that democratic and economic reconstruction in Yugoslavia represents its official and binding position. Such a statement would give hope to the citizens of our country and encourage the transformation of the political landscape.\n\nThe cycle of politics that over the past 10 years or more has led our country to this tragedy must be broken. If the war ends with a signature on a peace agreement and the same leadership in power, with Slobodan Milosevic at the helm, the tragedy and violence will continue.\n\nYugoslavia's stability is crucial because of its size and geographical position in the Balkans and its role in determining the stability or instability of neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania. To date, however, international strategy on Yugoslavia has boiled down to crisis management, while ignoring the roots of crisis.\n\nDemocracy can be established in our country only with a complete political transition in Serbia and the rest of Yugoslavia. This depends on free and fair elections, the strengthening of Serbia's democratic opposition, close cooperation with the democratic Government of Montenegro, the complete isolation of undemocratic forces and the establishment of an outside body to help monitor the political change.\n\nRespected European politicians with previous experience in the Balkans, like former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, former Chancellor Franz Vranitzky of Austria and Hans Koschnick, a veteran German Social Democrat, could work in such a commission under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nAccelerated economic reconstruction in the Balkans will be possible only with some variant of the Marshall Plan. The promise of outside aid would help the cause of democracy in Yugoslavia by tempering lingering anger. It will be difficult for the democratic opposition to function after this NATO campaign because people are likely to see us as part of that Europe -- part of that West -- that bombed us, destroyed bridges, roads and factories, and killed civilians. People will protest in both Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nBut there is hope for the democratic forces. Mr. Milosevic's policies are facing destruction, which would create the glimmer of a chance to build something new on those ruins. If anything good can be extracted from the evil that is now among us, it is the chance -- with international help -- for a new beginning for Yugoslavia.",

Hillary Clinton, disagreed on just about everything.\n\n\"I was so excited when I was told Sen. Clinton and I would be addressing you tonight,\" Fey told the audience, wearing a bright red suit and Palin's trademark glasses and speaking in a high-pitched lilt.\n\nPoehler replied: \"And I was told I'd be addressing you alone.\"\n\nPoehler's Clinton then set out to define the differences between her and the conservative Alaska governor.\n\n\"I believe that diplomacy should be the cornerstone of any foreign policy,\" she said.\n\n\"And I can see Russia from my house,\" Fey's Palin replied.\n\nPoehler continued, \"I believe global warming is caused by man.\"\n\n\"And I believe it's just God huggin' us closer,\" Fey responded.\n\n\"What an amazing time we live in to think that just two years ago, I was a small-town mayor of America's crystal meth capital, and now I am just one heartbeat away from being the President of the United States,\" Fey chirped.\n\n\"It just goes to show that anyone can be President - all you have to do is want it,\" Fey continued, prompting a cackle from Poehler.\n\nThe show was hosted by Michael Phelps, who set a record at the Beijing Olympics by winning eight gold medals in swimming. He proved he was no fish out of water, drawing his share of laughs as well.\n\n\"It's so great to be here hosting 'Saturday Night Live,'\" Phelps said. \"This seriously is the ninth greatest moment in my life.\"",

It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.",

He says he earns enough to easily meet the $700 monthly maintenance payments.\n\nBut Stanik, who works in video production, never even made it to a meeting before the board. \"They just said, 'You've been rejected.' That's it,\" he said.\n\nThink because you have the money, you can purchase a co-op? Think again.\n\nCo-op boards in the city have been notoriously difficult, and plenty of big shots from Mariah Carey to Richard Nixon have gotten a thumbs-down. But as prices have surged in recent years and boards have been burned by bad neighbors, they're taking toughness to new levels.\n\nCo-ops are setting higher financial hurdles, demanding more documents and refusing situations that used to be fine, such as allowing parents to buy on behalf of their children or letting buyers use their apartments as pieds-'a-terre. Though there is no formal report of co-op board rejections, they appear to be on the rise.\n\nAs a result, brokers are sometimes attempting to dissuade prospective buyers before bringing them to sellers.\n\n\"I sit at open houses and tell people they won't pass the board. They argue with me. This happens all the time,\" said Tami Shaoul, vice president at Corcoran Group.\n\nSome co-ops are making demands unheard of several years ago, like requiring that buyers with $1 million in income put a year's worth or more of maintenance in escrow. They want buyers to have liquid assets left over after their deal closes, well in excess of the purchase price.\n\n\"These aren't Park Avenue buildings - they're not even class B buildings,\" said one Manhattan real estate expert.\n\nAnd that tough stance is true for lower-priced apartments in the boroughs, as well.\n\nCo-op boards have legitimate concerns in scrutinizing would-be buyers. If a shareholder defaults, the building is on the hook for the maintenance. Back in the late 1980s and and early 1990s, a number of buildings got into financial trouble when their shareholders couldn't keep up payments. Boards are concerned about preserving their solid reputation.\n\nA co-op board can reject a would-be shareholder for all sorts of reasons and they are not obliged to reveal why they're giving the kiss-off.\n\n\"The board has basically unlimited rights in reviewing and accepting a potential purchaser, except they can not discriminate,\" said New York real estate attorney Andrew Brucker.\n\nMichele Kleier, president of real estate brokerage firm Gumley Haft Kleier, notes that some buyers are being hurt by unskilled brokers who aren't preparing them properly for their board reviews.\n\n\"Brokers do not know how to qualify their buyers,\" Kleier said. \"Many times people are stretching. Some of these board packages are embarrassing.\"\n\nBeware: Never lie on an application. Shaoul knows of someone who said they didn't own another property - and they did - and when the board found that out during an extensive check, it immediately rejected the applicant.\n\nStanik, rejected by a co-op board, said he's learned from his mistakes. His broker, Howard Schein of Corcoran, recently found him an 800-square-foot one-bedroom in a condo in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\n\n\"No board, no hassle,\" Stanik said.\n\nAt your meeting with the board, Prudential Douglas Elliman executive vice president Marsha Frances recommends:\n\nOnly speak when you are spoken to.\n\nTell the board how enthusiastic you are about the opportunity to live in the building.\n\nWhat you will need for a typical co-op board package, according to Corcoran Group's Tami Shaoul:\n\nFinancial statements with back-up documentation.\n\nTwo to three years of tax returns.\n\nTwo or three business references, for example a person familiar with your work.\n\nCommitment letter and loan application from your lender.\n\nExpect the board to do an extensive credit check; some check for a criminal record.\n\nIf you've faced a tough co-op board, let us know.\n\nWe'd like to hear your stories.

The contact sent Bayne sliding head-on into the inside wall before sliding back up the banking and coming to a rest at the top of the track in Turn 1.\n\nAnnett was unable to keep his car under him and slid down the frontstretch, getting hit by his teammate Justin Allgaier.\n\nThe incident brought out the third caution of the day at Dover International Speedway.\n\nWhile Allgaier was able to drive away, he took his car behind the wall for further repairs.\n\nAnnett was able to continue, but was 12 laps down in 40th by Lap 200.\n\nWith heavy damage to the nose of his No. 6 Ford, Bayne climbed from the car and walked down the banking to the ambulance. As a result, the 2011 Daytona 500 winner was called to the NASCAR hauler after the race.\n\nNASCAR requires that competitors remain in their cars after an incident until safety workers arrive on the scene.

If it gets nominated for best comedy series as it did three times in the past (2006-2008), that would be perceived as approval of star Charlie Sheen's antics behind the scenes. That would be hugely embarrassing to Warner Bros.\n\nBut does the studio have an unwritten obligation to submit the show and let the voters decide? After all, there are hundreds of other people who contribute to \"Two and a Half Men\" besides Charlie Sheen. (One of them is even TV academy chairman John Shaffner, who is the series' production designer.) They're all still eligible to compete in their own peer-group categories. \"Two and a Half Men\" scribes, for example, are still in the running for best comedy writing. But is it fair to remove the whole show from the comedy series contest just because of the shenanigans of one actor?\n\nArguably, the program's producers just don't believe the show was at its best this year, creatively speaking, so they don't wish to enter it for that reason. In other words, this decision isn't just a slap at Sheen but rather a realistic acknowledgment that the whole team wasn't operating at peak form last year while battling embarrassing inner turmoil, so they'd like to sit out this year's Emmy derby.\n\nOr maybe this decision is a preemptive strike? Maybe producers pulled out because they knew they had no chance at being nominated in the top race after all the recent hubbub over Sheen?",

AP Photo\n\nThe holiday season is approaching and retailers across the nation have already begun announcing plans to add staffers to the payroll this year. According to retail trade association National Retail Federation, retailers will add 585,000 to 625,000 hires.\n\n\u201cThis is the most optimistic forecast NRF has released since the recession. In spite of the uncertainties that exist in our economy and among consumers, we believe we\u2019ll see solid holiday sales growth this year,\u201d said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement.\n\nOne company adding to its payroll is Target, which will be one of the largest seasonal employers this year. The retail giant will hire 80,000 to 90,000 seasonal employees this year, which is down from 90,000 employees in 2011, according to Biz Journals. According to the Wall Street Journal, Target\u2019s figures are down this year because the Minneapolis-based company hired 30 percent of its seasonal staff from the previous holiday season for year-round positions.\u201d\n\nThe NRF expects consumers to increase spending 4.1 percent at retailers this holiday season.\n\nIn preparation for shoppers, Macy\u2019s is hiring 80,000 seasonal associates for the 2012 holiday season. In addition offering its current employees more hours, Walmart plans to hire 50,000 seasonal associates. In September, Kohl\u2019s department store announced plans to add 52,700 season employees this year, up 10 percent from 2011. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us staff of seasonal employees is up by 5,000 this year. The toys store will add 45,000 employees at stores and distribution centers for the 2012 holiday season.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not just the nationwide retailers that are hiring seasonal employees. Regional retailer Meijer Inc., which has more than 200 stores, has plans to hire 12,000 employees as it prepares for the upcoming holiday season.\n\nAccording to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consultant firm, seasonal hiring is expected to be up compared with last year but remains below pre-recession levels.\n\n\u201cRecent consumer confidence readings have been relatively weak and unemployment remains stubbornly high. The mixed picture is likely to compel retail employers to proceed cautiously when it comes to hiring extra workers for the holiday season,\u201d said John A. Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas in a statement.\n\n\u201cLook for many to start at last year\u2019s levels and hire additional workers only if strong sales early in the season warrant it.\u201d",

Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.; Senate Intelligence committee member Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind.; Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass; ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz; and editor of The New Yorker David Remnick.\n\nCoats says right now, suspected Boston bomber is \u2018in a condition where we can\u2019t get any information from him\u2019\n\nCOATS: The information we have is that there was a shot to the throat. And it\u2019s questionable whether \u2014 when and whether he\u2019ll be able to talk again. Doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t communicate, but right now I think he\u2019s in a condition where we can\u2019t get any information from him at all.\n\nMartha urges all media outlets to be \u2018careful\u2019 to avoid \u2018confirmation bias\u2019\n\nRADDATZ: \u2026Everybody was glued to the television, everybody wanted to know what was happening. We have to be careful \u2014 we all have to be careful. I take the lesson of a former intelligence officer, who said \u201cwhen I was a young man, my dad took me deer hunting. And we were laying there and looked out and my dad turned to me and he said \u2018son, when you go deer hunting everything starts looking like a deer.\u2019\u201d So we have to be careful, we have to make sure we don\u2019t have a confirmation bias that we want something to happen. CNN made a mistake, law enforcement made a mistake. You remember when it first happened, they said there was an explosion at the JFK Library.\n\nHaass says \u2018terrorism is never going to be eradicated, it\u2019s like disease\u2019\n\nHAASS: What\u2019s scary about this is how relatively easy it is. And if these guys could go on the internet, use primitive devices to do something like this, they\u2019re not the only ones who are going to do it. The attention they garnered is going to encourage copycat incidents \u2014 terrorism is never going to be eradicated, it\u2019s like disease.\n\nAnd what we have to think about is yeah, we go after it, but how do we make ourselves more resilient? How do we protect ourselves, how do we get better at bouncing back?\n\nRemnick calls out Rupert Murdoch and NY Post for its \u201cBag Men\u201d cover\n\nREMNICK: Outrageous. It\u2019s outrageous behavior. Look I have some sympathy for what happened to CNN. They\u2019re on all day long \u2013\n\nREMNICK: And they got legitimate, what they thought were legitimate sources telling them that there was an arrest. They turned out to be wrong, they corrected their mistake. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in their shoes.\n\nThis is something more pernicious. This is slapping on the front page of the newspaper with a wide circulation of something not confirmed at all, and it harms people\u2019s lives and I give that guy a lot of credit to go on television and talk to you. That takes courage.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Rupert Murdoch responded in a tweet, he said that all the \u201cNew York Post\u201d pictures were those distributed by the FBI and instantly withdrawn when the FBI changed directions.\n\nREMNICK: That\u2019s a lousy excuse. Sorry, that\u2019s a lousy excuse. It appeared on the front page of his newspaper, it was there for all to see. And it hurts that kid.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : Take responsibility and apologize.\n\nCoats thinks we need to step back and put immigration reform \u2018on hold\u2019\n\nCOATS: You usually end up with bad policy if you do it in an emotional way or an emotional reaction. We saw some things post-9/11 that were enacted that if we had had a little bit more rational time to think this through, perhaps we wouldn\u2019t have had some of the pushback on it.\n\nBut more importantly, immigration is an issue that has dramatic economic effect on Americans. It has national security implications. I think stepping back just a little bit and putting it on hold, for instance, we have a bigger issue than immigration in front of us. And that\u2019s our debt deficit and it\u2019s got to get solved.\n\nThompson says putting a hold on immigration \u2018is not in the best interest of this country\u2019\n\nTHOMPSON: It is not the right thing to do. We are a nation of immigrants. I trust our government , we vet people up and down. We review policies everyday. But, to put it on hold, is not in the best interest of this country.\n\nLike \u201cThis Week\u201d on Facebook here. You can also follow the show on Twitter here.",

There\u2019s something about Budapest that\u2019s very warm. Go there during the summer of the spring and you\u2019ll be surprised how much fun that is.\n\nQ: That\u2019s an unexpected answer, why Budapest?\n\nA.C.: Budapest is two cities, Buda and Pest. I didn\u2019t even know that. I\u2019m a college graduate and I didn\u2019t even know that.\n\nThe Danube (River) runs down the middle of it, so you can take these night dinner cruises down the Danube in the summertime. And c\u2019mon, that\u2019s the most romantic thing in the world. On both sides of it are old world cobblestone streets, it\u2019s 700, 800 years old. And there\u2019s something about that for Americans that\u2019s really cool.\n\nParis is Paris, and it\u2019s great. There are other great cities in Europe, but Budapest is the one that people kind of overlook. But that\u2019s the one you want to go to.\n\nQ: Any tips to really take advantage of the city?\n\nWell we love to walk. We just take off, we have no schedule at all. To me, a vacation is just not having any plans. We just start walking and wherever we end up, we end up. That way you see things that you would never see. You see little places and little restaurants that you would never go to.\n\nWhen I look at a brochure and it says, 'Don\u2019t forget to go to this restaurant,' I go, 'No, we\u2019re not going there!\u201d That\u2019s the tourist trap, right there. We\u2019re going to find some mom and pop place to go to.\n\nYou can get lost in an old town in Budapest. Little streets that go this way and that way. If you see something and say, 'We\u2019re going to come back tomorrow and get that.' you\u2019ll never find it because you get lost in the maze of the whole thing.\n\nQ: Thanks for opening our eyes on Budapest, now open our appetites. What\u2019s the food like?\n\nIf you like goulash, it's the best goulash in the world. It really is good, enough paprika in it to make it a little spicy. It seems like comfort food, it doesn\u2019t seem like high cuisine at all, which I really like.\n\nI really don\u2019t get off on really \u201cfoofy\u201d food.

It opens Tuesday after Saturday's community day.\n\nThe newly renovated Boarding Area E in Terminal 3 at San Francisco International Airport features midcentury-style Egg chairs and free Wi-Fi. It opens Tuesday after Saturday's community day.\n\nSFO terminal revamp ready for takeoff\n\nTravelers who recall the old American Airlines wing at Terminal 3 in San Francisco International Airport won't believe what's happened to it.\n\nThe long corridor with 10 gates featured a low, acoustic-tile ceiling with fluorescent lighting, black-and-white signs with gate numbers, and rows of those generic, black plastic-covered seats you can only find in airports. A couple of crowded restaurants and newsstands were wedged between the gates.\n\nAmerican moved to the new Terminal 2 in 2011, and its old space has been walled off, stripped to the foundation and studs and transformed into a new boarding area for United Airlines, which also occupies the rest of Terminal 3, at a cost of $138 million to the airport.\n\n\"We've provided a lot of luxury perks that you wouldn't expect to find at an airport,\" said airport director John Martin. \"Maybe at a hotel.\"\n\nThe new Boarding Area E - or Terminal 3E, as some have nicknamed it - is light, bright and ultramodern. It opens Tuesday. Along the main corridor, the ceiling has been raised 20 to 30 feet with plenty of natural light. At the end of the walkway, a 23-foot-tall picture window offers a panoramic view of the runways, and a dangling sculpture of giant metallic globes reflects the sunset and the bustle of the airport.\n\nThe terminal also features lounge-style seating with some chairs that swivel and some shaped like eggs - and even a few that look like a bent version of a flat person and allow travelers to recline on them.\n\nA children's area has no play structure or toys but an interactive art installation. \"Spyrogyrate,\" by Bay Area artist Eric Staller, has large lighted discs on the wall and floor that spin and change colors as people stand on them.\n\nLike the recently remodeled Terminal 2, the new wing has a yoga room with twinkling stars on the ceiling for those seeking a little tranquillity before their flights. A collection of restaurants and retail shops with an open feel and a local flavor - including two pop-up stores that will rotate once or twice a year - will serve travelers.\n\n\"We want the passenger, the moment he steps off the plane, to feel like he's in San Francisco - with local restaurants, local stores,\" said M. Arthur Gensler Jr., founder of Gensler, the firm that designed the renovation.\n\nThe terminal also offers free Wi-Fi, 375 power outlets, nine work stations and interactive maps that enable travelers to download airport information to their phones. Near the entry, a \"flight deck\" features touch-screen information panels and a big-screen map that depicts the last 24 hours of flights out of SFO zipping around the world.\n\nEven the restrooms are fancy and spacious, with natural light - there are even dressing rooms.\n\n\"SFO likes to provide four-star, five-star hotel-type restrooms,\" said Judy Mosqueda, the Terminal 3 project manager.\n\nSFO spokesman Doug Yakel said the airport originally planned a simple makeover for the boarding area but changed the plans after the popularity of the Terminal 2 remodel, which blended modern design, local food and retail and art. Martin said the overhauled boarding area \"goes a step above Terminal 2.\"\n\nNext up for SFO is a remodeling of the security checkpoint at Terminal 3 to improve passenger flow. The new checkpoint will include signs that display wait times. The airport will also expand the terminal to add three gates as well as more shops and restaurants. The security improvements are expected to be completed this summer, with the expansion a year away.\n\nFarther down the line is an overhaul of the dreary Terminal 1, which is in the same condition as the splashy new T3E was a little more than two years ago.\n\nMembers of the public don't need to be flying out of SFO to get a sneak peek at the new Boarding Area E before it opens. There will be a community day from noon to 5 p.m. Saturday. Admission is free, but reservations are required at: www.flySFO.com/t3e-opening.\n\nMichael Cabanatuan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail: mcabanatuan@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @ctuan",

California had a $0.87 tax on each pack of cigarettes while the illegal operation had been underway for over a year.\n\nThe cigarettes were shipped from China to ports in Newark, N.J., and New York City.

The two-time All-Star came to camp and did exactly what the Yankees wanted him to do: take the ball every five or six days and stay healthy. The Yankees knew what Garcia was - a steady, serviceable innings-eater who would keep them in the game more times than not.\n\nThey couldn't say the same about Colon, who hasn't pitched in a big-league game since July 2009, and hasn't been able to stay healthy since his Cy Young season of 2005.\n\n\"Bartolo was the wild card in all of this,\" Girardi said. \"I didn't really have any expectations of Bartolo.\"\n\nAll Colon did was pitch better than just about anybody in camp. His fastball sat consistently at 92-93 mph, his sinker dropped like an anchor and he had complete command of all of his breaking pitches. He even added a cutter to his repertoire. And while spring training numbers typically don't mean much, it's hard to ignore 17 strikeouts and one walk in 15 innings.\n\nHis reward? A trip to the bullpen.\n\n\"I wasn't even sure if I thought he would push himself into a roster spot, because he hadn't pitched much,\" Girardi said. \"You didn't know his velocity was going to be as high as 93, that he'd have that much movement on his fastball and that he'd be able to pick up a cutter in a day - and it happened.\"\n\nSo why isn't he starting, Joe?\n\n\"There were a lot of discussions about the way he's thrown the ball in spring training,\" Girardi said. \"He pitched winter ball as well, and sometimes those guys are a little bit ahead of other guys when they come to spring training. We thought that, for this fit right now, (the bullpen is) where he was best and could be the most productive for us.\"\n\nSo let me understand this. Colon pitched better than Garcia because he threw in winter ball? Does that mean Garcia will be hitting 93 mph a month from now? Unlikely.\n\nWould there have been some risk involved in giving Colon a spot in the rotation? Of course. Aren't the Yankees precisely the team to take such a risk, though?\n\nThe Yankees' mission statement each year is the same: Win the World Series. Handing the fifth-starter job to the guy pitching better would have been the Yankee way. Instead, they went with the safe, easy choice. That's what small-market teams that don't have flexibility are forced to do. Not the Yankees.\n\nLet's say the Yankees had decided to ride the hot hand and put Colon in the rotation to start the season. If they got 10 good starts out of him before breaking down, they could have then handed the job to Garcia, the ultimate security blanket.\n\nHad the Yankees been in a situation in which they had to release one of them, I would have understood sticking with Garcia based on his recent performance and the great unknown, that being Colon's durability and projected innings count. But once Sergio Mitre was dealt to the Brewers and it was clear both would stick, there was no reason not to give Colon the starting gig.\n\nGirardi acknowledged that Colon couldn't have pitched any better this spring than he did, but even that wasn't enough. So much for an open competition.\n\nColon first appeared on Girardi's radar this winter when the Yankees signed him at the recommendation of Tony Pena, who managed the pitcher this winter in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\"He said he looked good,\" Girardi said. \"Tony asked him to be in the bullpen. He said, 'Give me one start.' He gave him one start and he never left the rotation.\"\n\nPerhaps Girardi can learn something from his bench coach.",

Scores more, hundreds deep, are already waiting to get to the parkway at security checkpoints. The mood is happy, the crowds orderly and in good spirits.\n\nThey are filling downtown streets that are normally the domain of cars and roaring buses. But inside what is known as the papal \u201ctraffic box\u201d \u2014 the central districts of Philadelphia, where incoming cars have been banned for the weekend \u2014 the traffic is almost entirely on foot or two wheels. Bicyclists are out in large numbers.\n\nThe city\u2019s bike community saw opportunities for freedom of movement and association that are rarely, if ever, available. For one: staging a dessert-themed Popesicle Bike Race down the middle of Pine Street.\n\nKristen Suzda and Travis Southard, the race\u2019s organizers, met on Twitter and \u201cdecided to take advantage of all this,\u201d Ms. Suzda said. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating our open streets.\u201d\n\nTwo of the city\u2019s leading ice-cream vendors sent employees to race cargo bikes, the chunky three-wheeled trikes used to make eco-friendly deliveries. (More were invited, but other ice-cream shops were either closed for the weekend, to escape the potential chaos of an expected million pilgrims, or they could not spare staff on what they were hoping to be a very busy sales day.)\n\nThe event got off to a shaky start when the cargo bike piloted by Lindsay Smith toppled, with her on it, perhaps because cargo bikes are not designed for racing. Unhurt save for a scrape or two, she and a fellow racer, James Fulwiler, returned to the start line and re-rode the one-block course, with Mr. Fulwiler the winner. \u201cI just wanted to finish,\u201d Ms. Smith said with a laugh. \u201cI decided to take it slow.\u201d\n\nSaturday, hundreds of cyclists took to quiet, car-free streets for the Pope Ride, a miles-long course that threaded through Center City.\n\nBikers and pedestrians wanting a bit of open pavement to themselves have until early Monday morning.

A rarity that usually commands $100 or more in a restaurant, the gargantuan crustacean can be had for $87 at the festival, with the price including a hat and t-shirt as well as VIP line service and entry to all three days of the 14th Port of Los Angeles Lobster Festival, which runs from 14 to 16 September.\n\n\"This is a great addition to our lobster lineup. Guests have been asking since last year for a larger lobster option. The bragging rights alone are a great side to the dish,\" said Jim Hall, festival producer.\n\nThose intimidated by that amount of shellfish can opt for the regular Maine lobster meal (which includes coleslaw, a roll and lots of butter) at $19, or double up for $32. Those craving something other than seafood can peruse the international food court or the many food trucks on site, like the Baconmania Truck with its bacon-wrapped chicken drummettes or the Ragin Cajun truck\u2019s chicken and sausage bisque soup.\n\nUnlike the limited supply of gargantuan lobster, the family-friendly festival is purported to have a never-ending cache of freshly-caught lobsters flown in daily from the Gulf of Maine and cooked on the spot. In 2011, 32,000 Maine lobsters were flown in -- and event organisers are expecting to exceed that number this year with around 36,000.\n\nBut the lobster festival isn't just about the lobster. Live music from 19 indie bands will keep everyone dancing while kids can have fun at the pirate camp, going on scavenger hunts and taking in a pirate show.\n\nGeneral admission is $10 per day, or attendees can opt for the $41 First Class admission which covers all three days and includes a regular lobster meal, drink of choice (beer, wine or soda) and access to the VIP waterfront dining lounge. All tickets will be on sale at the gate, and First Class tickets can be purchased online in advance.\n\nCaroline Pardilla is the Los Angeles Localite for BBC Travel.

(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThinking about a facelift? Before you spend the money, consider this: It might help you look a few years younger but not more attractive, a new study found.\n\nThe study of 37 women and 12 men who underwent facial rejuvenation procedures like facelifts and eyelid lifts and found that plastic surgery shaved about three years off their perceived age. But it had no effect on their perceived attractiveness.\n\n\u201cThe drive to maintain a youthful appearance and attractiveness has been an important motivating factor leading patients to seek aesthetic facial surgery,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study, published today in the journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery. \u201cFrom this study, it seems that the attractiveness level will remain the same, regardless of age.\u201d\n\nRead about the fine line between therapeutic and cosmetic eyelid lifts.\n\nA group of 50 men and women was tasked with guessing the patients\u2019 ages and rating their attractiveness on a 10-point scale. As perceived age went up, attractiveness scores went down, according to the study. But those scores failed to improve with surgery.\n\nThe authors theorized that attractiveness is intractably linked to perceived age. So when the patients looked younger post-surgery, their attractiveness score shifted down since they were being compared to younger people. In other words, the old adage \u201cyou look good for your age\u201d is only a factor when you know how old someone really is.\n\n\u201cBecause a person\u2019s age is perceived as younger following aging face surgery, his or her attractiveness level is also intuitively perceived to be better, commensurate with the apparent age reduction,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAs long as a person ascribes a correct age to someone else, that person will perceive the other\u2019s attractiveness with his or her assigned age in mind.\u201d\n\nRead about how social media is spurring plastic surgery.\n\nInterestingly, female raters tended to ascribe higher attractiveness scores than male ones. And 75 percent of all of the raters\u2019 scores landed in the four-to-seven range, according to the authors.\n\nAmericans underwent a whopping 1,594,526 cosmetic surgical procedures in 2012, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. And eyelid lifts were the third most common procedure, with some 204,000 recipients \u2013 more than 98,000 of them 55 and older.\n\nAll in all, Americans spent more than $1.4 billion on facelifts and eyelid lifts last year, according to the ASPS.

The increases were less than 1 percent, except at CapitalOne, which saw delinquencies rise to 3.65 percent of balances.\n\nLast week, the Federal Reserve said that its member banks reported a 3.4 percent annualized decline in credit card balances in August. Total revolving credit outstanding fell to $790 billion in the month, from a peak of $972 billion in September 2008.\n\nAt American Express Co., delinquencies accounted for 1.5 percent of balances, up from 1.4 percent the month before. That\u2019s the lowest delinquency rate in the industry. Discover Financial Services\u2019 rate, which was 2.5 percent, also rose just one-tenth of a percentage point, while Chase, the nation\u2019s largest card company by spending volume, posted a rate of 2.53 percent, up from 2.48 percent, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBank of America\u2019s highest-in-the-industry rate rose to 3.99 percent from 3.96 percent. BofA also had the highest default rate, at 5.99 percent of balances.\n\nOne reason card rates remain stubbornly high is the rate at which banks get stiffed by cardholders. Industry-wide, the default, or charge-off, rate, hit 10.96 percent of balances in 2010\u2032s second quarter and has since declined to 5.6 percent in this year\u2019s second quarter.\n\nThe average credit card debt per household is $15,799 and the average interest rate on cards is 13 percent. At $150 a month, that debt will never be paid off. At $266 a month, it will take eight years and the interest paid will be $9,693.

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 1 sentences.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nOn a frosty moonlit night in August 1944, 545 Japanese captives broke out of the prison camp for Japanese, Italians and Koreans near the town of Cowra. Two hundred and thirty-four of the prisoners and four Australian soldiers died. The missing escapees were recaptured. Tom Keneally was a boy of nine living in Sydney at the time. His father was away at the war, and Keneally remembers the terror that the outbreak struck into the hearts of everyone around him. In this novel inspired by the events, Keneally reveals again the power that the conflicts of the 20th century have over him. Again he gives vivid human faces to the victims and the perpetrators of war. He weaves his magic and the reader falls under his spell.\n\nFiction, Keneally says in his introduction, tries to tell the truth by fabrication, and he goes on to explain that here he is \"interpreting\" the \"phenomenon of Cowra\". And phenomenon it was \u2013 one of the biggest and bloodiest escapes of the war. The narrative is prefaced by the brief story of a liar trapped in his own fabrications. This is Aoki, a Japanese prisoner now returned home to his wife in 1946. The preface ends: \"Within the limits of everlasting deceit, he answered the unnegotiable kindness of her breasts.\" As the word \"kindness\" flows onto the page, it melts the reader\u2019s heart.\n\nNow it is back to spring 1943. Part one opens near fictional Gawell (Cowra) where 23-year-old Alice Herman is sitting on the veranda sewing buttons onto a shirt, while a stew is cooking on the stove. Sew as she might, everything is about to come undone. Will her man Neville come home to the kindness of her breasts? For Neville is a prisoner of the Germans in Austria, and Alice is living on the farm with her father-in-law Duncan Herman, perhaps the wisest character in the book. The peaceful domestic scene on the veranda is disrupted by the arrival on the road of a truckload of Japanese men who are filling in potholes. To Alice\u2019s mind they are \"Oriental exotics\", and the sight of their \"russet-dyed uniforms\" foreshadows, at least for the reader, the gruesome bloodshed that is to come after another year has passed. Alice humanises the prisoners by offering them lemonade, saying she wants to \"treat them well\" in the hope that Neville might also be treated well. After the breakout Alice will in fact shoot one of these men.\n\nThe notion of sympathetic magic is also part of the thinking of Major Suttor, whose son is in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Suttor\u2019s war work includes the writing of a popular radio serial about a rural family called the Mortons whose lives reflect, in a sanitized way, the lives of everyday Australians. The irony of Suttor\u2019s position in both the reality of the camp and in the fiction of the Mortons plays across the narrative, and after the breakout Suttor says: \"It\u2019s like a radio serial. You chaps make it up as you go along.\" Oh, such a very different radio serial that would be. Alongside Suttor is the English colonel Ewan Abercare who also hopes that by showing the prisoners dignity and respect he can affect the treatment of allied captives. Abercare will die in the breakout, a hero. His personal life is explored in all its painful and tragic detail, and in the final chapter the reader learns that his actions were \"an act of civilisation\" to which the Japanese reacted with \"barbarism\".\n\nA dozen times the word \"shame\" appears, in most cases in the context of Japanese thinking. What the Australian authorities fail to understand, what leads to the suicidal breakout, is that the prisoners are suffering from the religious shame of being living captives. To their families they are dead, mourned at elaborate shrines. Hence Aoki\u2019s \"everlasting deceit\"; his wife can never know he was a prisoner. Of course shame is not confined to Japanese prisoners \u2013 every major character, with the possible exception of Herman, has reason to be ashamed.\n\nAlongside the graphic depiction of life in the camp, and of the way the breakout is executed, runs Alice\u2019s romance with an Italian prisoner who works on the Herman farm. This story implodes at the same time as Alice shoots the Japanese escapee, and when her man returns order is duly restored as in a radio serial. Keneally negotiates the separate and intertwining narratives with his usual elegance and skill.",

(Under current law, the energy manager is not required to consider such actions.) Requires the energy manager, as part of the Web-based compliance certification system, to provide reasons for not implementing life cycle cost-effective measures. Requires each agency to: (1) use the benchmarking systems selected or developed for the agency under the Act to track energy savings realized by the agency through the implementation of energy-saving or conservation measures and submit information regarding such savings for publication on a website of the Department of Energy (DOE), and (2) consider using energy savings performance or utility energy service contracts to implement such measures. Establishes a goal of entering into energy savings performance contracts or utility energy service contracts equal to $1 billion in each year during the 5-year period beginning on January 1, 2014. Requires each agency to report annually to DOE, and DOE to report to Congress, on progress towards achieving such goal."

Stop thinking you are. Stop living off it, too.The Hawks just dropped under .500 overall. They just lost their fourth straight at home to plummet to a sorry 4-7 in the United Center. They have the worst winning percentage in the Central Division and second-worst in the Western Conference.And jeez, the way they blew it Wednesday night, losing to sub-.500 Phoenix 2-1 in their own building the same way they lost to sub-.500 Edmonton 2-1 in their own building the game before. Listen, \u201cOne Goal\u2019\u2019 is supposed to be a slogan, not the end of the scoring.Play like this is your job. Play like this matters. But mostly, play faster.Skate faster. Pass faster. Shoot faster.Fight to get to the rebounds in the slot faster. Heck, fight to get to the slot faster, period.Move the puck out of your own zone faster, and for God\u2019s sake, get to the boards faster and win the puck faster.This is a puck-possession team that almost never has the puck and rarely does something good when it does. There are long stretches where they pass as if Mike Martz is behind the bench. This just doesn\u2019t look like last season\u2019s champions, and that\u2019s the point: They aren\u2019t that team.Get over it, you and them. Everybody, wake up. The Hawks can\u2019t explain it because they have no idea who they are.So, here\u2019s the deal: Joel Quenneville needs to take this team back a couple years to when he replaced Denis Savard. Let me be clear: I\u2019m not blaming Quenneville here. I think he\u2019s the best bench coach in the league and one of the smartest coaches altogether. I\u2019m just thinking perspective and approach here.Four games into that 2008-09 season, Quennville came in with new ideas for a new team: He wanted everything done faster.Speed is the most intimidating weapon in hockey. Making plays at top speed is what champions do. See the \u201985 Oilers, the \u201890s Avalanche, and the last 15 years of the Red Wings for details. That was Queeneville\u2019s point, and he even wanted players to make mistakes faster so at least they could recover faster defensively. Get back to their zone quickly to make themselves available to move the puck quickly the other way. The concept was simple: If the Hawks have the puck, the other team can\u2019t score.And the Hawks had the puck, believe me. Had the puck a lot. They became the fastest team in the league because they went tape-to-tape better than anybody.The concept, the approach and the teaching methods were new back then. Fun, too. The young Hawks took to the idea of aggressively capturing the puck and owning it, refusing to give it up until the red light went on. Young, undecorated players listened eagerly to Quenneville, then executed his plan all the way to the Western Conference final. They had done something.We all know what happened last season. Same approach, better execution. The Hawks didn\u2019t just do something, they did everything. Now they are doing everything they can to piddle on that wondrous accomplishment because they are nothing like that team.They are not that team, period.Almost half the roster was turned over. Depth and character were lost. New bodies are being integrated. The best players, however, were retained in Stan Bowman\u2019s version of \u201cApuckalypse Now.\u2019\u2019 Talking to you, Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, Patrick Sharp, Marian Hossa, Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook. You guys haven\u2019t played consistently as if you are the best players on the Hawks. Jeez, most of you haven\u2019t played as if you could even be the best players in Rockford.It\u2019s not that the Stanley Cup champions can\u2019t defend their glorious title. It\u2019s that this team is not the Stanley Cup champion. That group is gone. See ya. Au revoir. This group is a new team that has won nothing.This needs to become 2008-09 again. Some good, young talent. Some potential depth and heart. Some possibilities in goal. Some chance to become a team. Quenneville has to get their attention and teach them the basics of the system all over again, and fast.",

Snow totals could exceed 6ft by the end of Wednesday \u2013 with another storm expected on Thursday.\n\nResponse teams in western New York, accustomed to harsh winters, were surprised by the unusually early and heavy precipitation. Schools closed as New York governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in several counties and has 150 members of the state national guard and extra teams of snow plows.\n\nHigh winds have exacerbated conditions, and temperatures dropped below freezing across most of the US, with subzero temperatures in Illinois, Wisconsin and Nebraska, where a teenager died from exposure. In the Buffalo area, two people shoveling snow during the storm died of heart attacks, a third was pinned beneath a car while trying to free it, a fourth found inside his car, and a fifth also suffered a heart attack.\n\nSnow drifts and ice have paralyzed more than 150 vehicles on on more than 100 miles of roadway, including the Niagara University women\u2019s basketball team, trapped on board their bus for more than 24 hours. The team coach told the Associated Press that players were so thirsty they drank melted snow. Traffic accidents blamed on icy conditions have killed more than a dozen people.\n\nWeather experts blame a phenomenon called the lake effect for the exceptionally intense storm; cold winds pick up the warm, moist air over lakes, freezing it as it travels before dumping it suddenly when those winds reach land. Nestled on Lake Erie\u2019s shores and not far from Lake Ontario, Buffalo was struck by a curiosity of the effect \u2013 snow buried its southern suburbs but barely dusted its northern outskirts.\n\nThe huge system dropped as much of 18 inches in Michigan, shut down schools in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and forced roads closed in Indiana, New Hampshire and around the US. Cities in Alaska may be warmer than towns in northern Florida on Wednesday if temperatures rise as expected. Through Friday, Buffalo will have to soldier through two separate lake effect warnings, and possibly as much as two more feet of snow as storm bands sweep in.",

By Jean Anouilh. Adapted by Christopher Fry. With Toby Stephens, Richard Clarke, Candy Buckley, Marian Seldes, Gretchen Egolf and others. Sets by John Lee Beatty. Directed by Gerald Gutierrez. At the Belasco. Tickets, $25-$55; (212) 239-6200.\n\nThat \"Ring Round the Moon\" is set in a hothouse seems appropriate. The atmosphere is stifling and airless, and whatever grows is forced and artificial.\n\nWritten by Jean Anouilh in 1946, the play takes place in the rarified world of the French upper class before World War I.\n\nThe play's brittle comedy depends on the nuances of social class. Its efforts at profundity are concerned, above all, with rich peoples' games. Even the play itself is a self-conscious game, and uses one of the hoariest comic devices identical twins.\n\nOne of the twins, Hugo, is engaged in an elaborate deception. He hires a beautiful dancer to shake his brother of his obsession with a woman he himself loves. In the 1950s, conceits like this seemed rather daring. Now, they're a bit tiresome.\n\nTo exert any real grip on a contemporary audience, \"Ring Round the Moon\" needs to be staged with a special elegance. It has to make up in style what it lacks in substance. And Gerald Gutierrez' production, presented by Lincoln Center, is fatally short on style.\n\nWith John Lee Beatty's elegant set and John David Ridge's gorgeous costumes, it does have a sumptuous look. But neither the direction nor the acting come close to the kind of haughty confidence that the play demands.\n\nGutierrez never makes us believe that we are in an enclosed world with its own codes and meanings. Even the accents, sometimes British, sometimes American, wander back and forth across the Atlantic.\n\nThe stage tricks involved in Toby Stephens' playing of both twins are labored, and the attempts to liven things up with knockabout comedy are heavy-handed.\n\nThe acting, meanwhile, is fatally uncertain, with only Marian Seldes as the old matriarch and Richard Clarke as the butler having a clear sense of what they are doing.\n\nAll in all, this \"Moon\" sheds little light on the mystery of why Gutierrez wanted to revive the play at all.",

Legions of officers and water cannon stood ready near France's National Assembly ahead of the final vote, bracing for possible violence on an issue that galvanized the country's faltering conservative movement.\n\nThe measure passed easily in the Socialist-majority Assembly, 331-225, just minutes after the president of the legislative body expelled a disruptive protester in pink, the color adopted by French opponents of gay marriage.\n\n\"Only those who love democracy are here,\" Claude Bartelone, the Assembly president, said angrily.\n\nIn recent weeks, violent attacks against gay couples have spiked and some legislators have received threats -- including Bartelone, who got a gunpowder-filled envelope on Monday.\n\nOne of the biggest protests against same-sex marriage drew together hundreds of thousands of people bused in from the French provinces -- conservative activists, schoolchildren with their parents, retirees, priests and others. That demonstration ended in blasts of tear gas, as right-wing rabble-rousers, some in masks and hoods, led the charge against police, damaging cars along the Champs-Elysees avenue and making a break for the presidential palace.\n\nJustice Minister Christiane Taubira told lawmakers that the first weddings could be as soon as June.\n\n\"We believe that the first weddings will be beautiful and that they'll bring a breeze of joy, and that those who are opposed to them today will surely be confounded when they are overcome with the happiness of the newlyweds and the families,\" she said.\n\nWhen President Francois Hollande promised to legalize gay marriage, it was seen as relatively uncontroversial. But the issue has become a touchstone as his popularity has sunk to unprecedented lows, largely over France's ailing economy.\n\nBut the most visible face in the fight against gay marriage -- a former comedienne who goes by the name of Frigide Barjot -- said the movement named \"A Protest for Everyone\" will continue beyond the law's passage and possibly field candidates in 2014 municipal elections. She said anyone involved in protest violence would be marginalized, but blamed the government for its failure to listen.\n\n\"The violence comes from the way in which this was imposed,\" Barjot told France Info radio.\n\nFrench conservatives, decimated by infighting and the election loss of standard-bearer Nicolas Sarkozy, had found a rallying cause in same-sex marriage. Hoping to keep the issue alive, the conservative UMP party planned to challenge the law in the Constitutional Council.\n\nFrench civil unions, allowed since 1999, are at least as popular among heterosexuals as among gay and lesbian couples. But that law has no provisions for adoption, and the strongest opposition in France as far as same-sex couples goes comes when children are involved. According to recent polls, just over half of French are opposed to adoption by same-sex couples -- about the same number who said they favored same-sex marriage.\n\nChristophe Crepin, spokesman for the police union UNSA, says the extraordinary security Tuesday includes a total of about 4,000 officers in the area near the National Assembly building and water cannon positioned nearby. One group of anti-riot police swarmed the banks of the Seine River about a quarter-mile from the legislature, hours before protests were scheduled there.\n\nFrance is the 14th country to legalize gay marriage. On the cover of Tuesday's Liberation newspaper, the famed gay photographers Pierre and Gilles took over the front page and several of the inside pages, splashing them with some of their most provocative photos, including one of three soccer players -- nude but for the footwear -- facing the camera.\n\nIn New Zealand, where gay marriage enjoys popular support, people gathered outside Parliament and joined in singing a traditional Maori love ballad after a vote last week making it legal. Nine states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. also recognize such marriages, but the federal government does not.",

It starred Rebecca DeMornay as a nanny who torments a family while exacting a complicated revenge, and proved Hanson\u2019s chops as an effective exponent of mainstream Hollywood style: meaty, thrilling and unashamedly populist.\n\nIt was this facility he brought to his best work, all of which was made in the following decade. It ranged from persuading Meryl Streep to negotiate whitewater rapids in The River Wild, or corralling Eminem through a semi-biographical account of a young rapper\u2019s battle for glory in 8 Mile, and even the putatively dusty campus comedy drama Wonder Boys, where Michael Douglas\u2019 complicated emotional life turns into a series of challenges to be overcome.\n\nThis, of course, also applies to LA Confidential, the film for which Hanson will be undoubtedly best remembered and one for which he won an Oscar \u2013 for best adapted screenplay, along with Brian Helgeland (who went to direct Legend). I must confess to a prickle of apprehension when I heard that Hanson \u2013 \u201cthe River Wild guy\u201d \u2013 had got the gig to direct one of the era\u2019s great cult crime novels, but in the event the director won everybody over by focusing with laser-beam intensity on the personal odysseys of the two main characters, played by Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. Not only did this successfully Hollywoodise James Ellroy\u2019s sprawling, gruesome book, but Hanson was also brave enough to launch the little-known actors into stellar careers of their own. It was a film that deserved its multiple Oscar nominations \u2013 and in Kim Basinger, who won for best supporting actress, Hanson found something of a muse; he would cast her again as Eminem\u2019s damaged, alcoholic mother in 8 Mile.\n\nHanson was schooled in the no-budget conveyor belt operated in the early 1970s by Roger Corman \u2013 for whom he earned his first two significant feature credits, as a writer on The Dunwich Horror, and as writer-director on Sweet Kill \u2013 and presumably there learned his economy of style and no-frills approach to narrative logic. Hanson hacked his way through the lower reaches of Hollywood in the 80s, though was perhaps unlucky to direct Losin\u2019 It, the least successful of Tom Cruise\u2019s contribution to the teen-movie wave. Only when he got aboard the yuppie-in-peril thriller Bad Influence in 1990 did Hanson\u2019s luck begin to turn; it was a clear precursor/rehearsal for Cradle.\n\nHaving become Hollywood aristocracy on the back of LA Confidential, Hanson could afford to indulge himself to a certain extent: Wonder Boys was an unlikely follow-up, as was 8 Mile \u2013 though with the latter, at least, Hanson could ally himself with an edgy, credible force in Eminem. In later decades, he might have found himself directing superhero movies, though he did manage some high-end TV: the HBO movie Too Big to Fail, about the 2008 financial crisis. If Hanson was a film-making chameleon, he undoubtedly showed himself to be a popular, savvy one.",

He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011.\n\nHe quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens.\n\nBizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader.\n\nOn his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles.\n\nIn one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'.\n\nIn 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims.\n\nMr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that.\n\n'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.'\n\nHe also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud.\n\n'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember\u2026 Personally I didn't find it that shocking.'\n\nMr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left)\n\nAccording to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance.\n\n'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.'\n\nAnother post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil and held in a cellar for.\n\nMr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.'\n\nMs Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for \u00a3249,950 in 2007 in North London.\n\nLast night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks.\n\nA spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011.\n\n'The party does not endorse the views expressed and would not want to be associated with them.

She called it a \"despicable activity.\"\n\nEighty percent of countries across the globe have signed an international pact swearing off the use of land mines. Syria is one of 37 countries that have not ratified the ban, along with major powers such as China and the United States. Lebanon hasn\u2019t joined either, though it has voiced support for the pact.\n\nTurkey, which has signed on to the ban, says it is investigating the alleged mines on its border with Syria, Human Rights Watch said. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken out before against Syria, accusing the army of \"butchering its own people.\"\n\nSyria has been widely condemned by the United Nations and rights groups for rampant abuses including killings and torture. Using land mines has drawn another burst of international outrage because the weapons can kill and maim long after a conflict has ended.\n\nLast year, a Syrian official speaking on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press that the government was laying mines to stop smugglers bringing arms into Syria.

It\u2019s not crazy talk,\" Taber MacCallum, CEO of Paragon Space Development Corp., told CNN.\n\nMacCallum and millionaire Dennis Tito announced their plans Wednesday to send a couple of earthlings on a 501-day trip in a spacecraft that would fly by the red planet. The proposal was unveiled at the National Press Club in Washington.\n\nThe mission would lift off in 2018, they said. It would not involve landing on Mars, making the proposed journey infinitely easier than putting people on the planet's surface, which NASA wants to do later this century. But the spacecraft would pass within 100 miles of the planet.\n\nTito has founded the Inspiration Mars Foundation, a nonprofit organization spearheading this effort. No stranger to space, the one-time NASA engineer became in 2001 the first space tourist flying on a Russian rocket to the International Space Station.\n\nThe public-private initiative could, according to MacCallum, use an existing rocket and capsule.\n\n\u201cIf you take existing chemistry and technology and add some improved technologies,\" MacCallum told CNN, \"you can get a mission together.\u201d A life support system also would have to be developed.\n\nThe group is not asking NASA for money, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a philanthropic effort to be done for America,\u201d MacCallum said. It could be accomplished for under $1 billion, he said, a figure that\u2019s cheap compared with the tens of billions of dollars a NASA landing on Mars would cost.\n\nAt Wednesday's press conference, the panel mentioned selling media rights and finding sponsorship as well as other forms of fund-raising. It was noted that a 6-year-old boy already made a contribution, sending in $10 and calling this mission \"my Apollo.\"\n\nDespite MacCallum\u2019s optimism, pulling off such a feat within five years is no small task.\n\nBesides life support for the crew, one of the biggest challenges would be the return into the Earth's atmosphere. Heat shielding for a high speed re-entry hasn\u2019t been tested. NASA isn\u2019t even testing its new system on the Orion spacecraft until next year at the earliest. Orion is in development to take astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars.\n\nAnd there\u2019s also concern about radiation exposure. The man and woman whom MacCallum and Tito want to send would likely be a married couple. Because of the radiation risk, MacCallum said, they\u2019d be older and \u201cout of the childbearing years.\u201d\n\nDr. Jonathan Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon and chief medical officer of Inspiration Mars Foundation, said the crew should be selected six months to a year before the mission to allow time for a full health screening. And the mission planners will have to prepare for the possibility of a crew member perishing.\n\n\"If we wanted a guarantee, we wouldn't be doing this,\" he said.\n\nWater and oxygen will be recycled in flight, so the crew will be drinking and breathing the same resources over and over throughout the journey, Inspiration Mars representatives said.\n\n\"No two people will have ever been more alone than the crew of this mission,\" Miles O'Brien, press conference moderator and former CNN correspondent, said at the event.\n\nThe year for the mission was chosen because Mars then will be 36 million miles away, about as close as it ever gets to Earth.\n\nBut consider: The humans who have traveled the farthest from Earth were the Apollo astronauts \u2013 nearly a quarter-million miles to the moon. Next to the Mars journey, that\u2019s like a walk around the block.\n\nStill, Tito said Wednesday, \"This is a challenging but attainable goal for advancing human ... knowledge. Now is the time.\"\n\nMore: What we've done on Mars, and what's next\n\nCNN's Sophia Dengo contributed to this report.",

It's actually fairly likely, thanks to a ruling handed down Tuesday by the FCC that will allow Internet service providers to charge customers based on the amount of bandwidth they use. And some argue that it's the greatest threat to freedom we face today.\n\nWelcome to the complex world of net neutrality.\n\nThe basic problem is simple: As online video has grown in popularity, thanks to sites like YouTube and Hulu.com, Internet service providers (ISPs) complain that each consumer is more of a burden to service -- that's you, me and your next-door neighbor, Phil.\n\nToday, Comcast, Time Warner, or whomever you pay monthly, charges you and Phil more or less the same amount. But Phil watches four hours of basketball online every night. Should he pay more for that? There's the neutrality part, the argument that you should pay one fee for access to the entire Internet, regardless of what type of content you watch or which sites you visit.\n\nWell \u2026 that makes sense, right? If service providers could charge based on the type of content you watch, they could easily create a system like that of today's cable television market. Want HBO? It's an extra $5. Want our streaming video package, with YouTube, Hulu, TV.com, and more? That's $5 too. Don't pay and you can't watch. Period.\n\n\"Internet service giants like Comcast and Verizon want to offer premium and privileged access to the Internet for corporations who can afford to pay for it,\" worried Minnesota senator Al Franken in an editorial at the Huffington Post. ISPs argue -- and the FCC just agreed -- that they should be allowed to charge based on the amount of bandwidth they use. It remains to be seen whether the type of content will be protected, however.\n\nThe more people speculate, the more the nightmarish scenarios quickly pile up.\n\nConsider the overlap between service providers and content providers. Time Warner owns local channel NY1 in New York City. What's to stop the company from optimizing access to its site -- and charging you more for access to other local news? Sound silly? Don't forget that Comcast has been fighting to buy NBC, at a proposed $13.8 billion.\n\nMaybe that's why Franken called it the most important issue of our time.\n\nOthers agree -- but argue that the best thing we can do is absolutely nothing.\n\nNothing is broken that needs fixing, wrote Robert McDowell, a Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, in an opinion essay in the Wall Street Journal. \"The Internet has been open and freedom-enhancing since it was spun off from a government research project in the early 1990s. Its nature as a diffuse and dynamic global network of networks defies top-down authority. Ample laws to protect consumers already exist.\"\n\nOpinions are so diverse it's hard to wrap your head around, and all perspectives seem realistic, at least on some level. Technologists are passionate: TechCrunch editor John Biggs wrote that \"if we stay silent on this, the Internet will change.\"\n\nPrivacy advocates are worried: watchdogs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation fear that rules will make it impossible for new companies to launch, creating \" barriers to entry for the next generation of garage innovators.\"\n\nNet neutrality may be designed to allow for a tiered Internet. Or it may end up preventing one entirely. Who knows? The FCC held most discussions behind closed doors, until this morning's debate and final approval of the regulations.\n\nBut either way, it's bound to end up affecting your wallet. And you should care -- if for no other reason than that.",

There seems to be a multi-pronged assault on Grameen Bank and on Muhammad Yunus, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his role pioneering microfinance.\n\nThe Bangladeshi press has lately been full of denunciations of Yunus. On Tuesday, for example, one Bangladeshi news organization quoted an economist as saying of him: \u201cA lot about him is just myth. [He] had never been selfless in any of his initiatives.\u201d Meanwhile the Bangladeshi government has ordered a corruption investigation of Grameen after a Norwegian television documentary raised questions, even though the Norwegian government said there was nothing to the charges. There have also been (false) published reports that Yunus will resign and suggestions that he should retire for reasons of age. And it seems the government of Sheikh Hasina Wazed wants to revise the ownership of Grameen Bank so that it would be 60 percent government-owned. That was the situation in the 1980\u2019s, but then the law was revised to state that ownership would be 75 percent by Grameen borrowers, and 25 percent by the government; in fact, despite the law, Grameen borrowers have paid in more capital, and so the government stake is down to 3.4 percent as of 2009. (An earlier version of this post had incorrect figures here).\n\nFinally, a court has ordered Yunus to appear on Jan. 18 to face charges of defamation, apparently for saying in 2007 that politicians pursue only money. He could be arrested and tossed in prison for that. And given the timing, it sure looks as if this is an orchestrated campaign to take him out, and seize the bank for the government. If this is a concerted campaign, then presumably it could happen only with the approval of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. And she does seem to have changed her pitch: a former supporter of microfinance, she recently denounced it as \u201csucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation.\u201d\n\nLook, Professor Yunus is no more above the law than anyone else. He and Grameen deserve close scrutiny. Microfinance should be debated. But the present campaign against Yunus doesn\u2019t ring true to me, or to some others who are watching. (I\u2019ve spoken to people on three continents, on all sides of this issue, but people are afraid to speak openly). I just don\u2019t know what is going on. It may be that the government worries that Yunus will enter politics, or criticize politicians \u2014 and they may also be salivating at the prospect of gaining control over Grameen, which touches 1 person in 3 in Bangladesh.\n\nI\u2019ve often made the point in my columns, and Sheryl WuDunn and I also made it in our book \u201cHalf the Sky,\u201d that Bangladesh has thrived in recent decades because of the strength of its civil society \u2014 especially Grameen and the equally amazing organization BRAC. Government governance has frankly been disappointing, but civil society has helped account for Bangladesh\u2019s enormous gains. If the government is now going to crush the country\u2019s strongest sector, heaven help it. And if Yunus is arrested on some trumped-up charges Bangladesh will have destroyed its credibility.\n\nMicrofinance is in a crisis these days, particularly because of problems in Andhra Pradesh, India (here\u2019s one excellent background piece and here\u2019s another). There is no doubt that the sector\u2019s very success has attracted bad apples. But it\u2019s also clear that Grameen and Dr. Yunus have had an enormous positive impact upon Bangladesh and the world. He deserved that Nobel Peace Prize. The international community needs to make sure that funny business in Bangladesh doesn\u2019t savage one of the great successes of development. For her part, Sheikh Hasina should forthrightly declare that the government will continue with its 25 percent stake in Grameen and won\u2019t try to increase it.\n\nLet\u2019s hope this is all a tempest in a teacup. If not, and if Grameen is turned into a state bank, that would be a catastrophe \u2014 above all for the impoverished people who depend on it. And if a Nobel Peace Prize winner can be shunted aside, then all of civil society is in jeopardy.\n\nPostscript: an earlier version of this post said that the government owns 25 percent of Grameen Bank. That\u2019s the law but in fact, as noted above, the government stake was 3.4 percent as of 2009. Mea culpa.",

Friday, the United States Court of Appeals brought the president back to Earth and reminded him that that the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause and the U.S. Senate are very much part of reality by voiding three of Obama\u2019s recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit ruled that the president could not end-run the confirmation process merely because at the beginning of 2012 the U.S. Senate was meeting every three business days in, what lawyers call, pro forma session. Oh, and during that pro forma session the Senate was also busy passing the payroll tax extension. Some pro forma session.\n\nIn its decision, the Court made clear that our president answers to Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution which, in the words of the Court, \u201cprovides that the president \u2018shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, the language of the Constitution is pretty straight forward. If you are the President and you want to appoint someone to a position of serious responsibility that nominee must be vetted and approved by the Senate. Yes, the Senate can be cantankerous, unruly and even stupid. But, these are not constitutionally recognized rationales for the president to thumb his nose at the Appointments Clause.\n\nGeorge Washington respected the Appointments Clause. Abraham Lincoln respected that rule. John F. Kennedy respected the Appointments Clause. Ronald Reagan respected the Appointments Clause. Barack Obama, former president of the Harvard Law Review and constitutional law lecturer at the University of Chicago? Not so much.\n\nThe president thought that he had a better idea, and decided to take his cue from that paragon of virtue Warren G. Harding and the first president to be impeached, Andrew Johnson. Mr. Obama appointed someone (make that three someones) to posts that otherwise required confirmation, despite the fact that the Senate was still in session.\n\nBarack Obama figured that he could roll the Senate and roll the dice in one fell-swoop. He bet that he could hang his hat on the Constitution\u2019s Recess Appointments Clause -- and get away with it.\n\nThe Recess Appointments Clause permits the president to make a temporary appointment when Congress is really out of session to vacancy that really first arises when Congress is really out of session -- as when it has adjourned sine die, lawyer-speak and Latin for \u201cwithout date\u201d. Under the Recess Appointments Clause, the president \u201cshall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\u201d Id. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 3.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. When the president filled the NLRB with three supposed recess appointments the Senate was still doing its thing. It was very much \u201cin session.\u201d In other words, the Senate was busy, but the White House hell-bent on imposing its appointees on the American public, advice and consent be damned.\n\nTo top it all off, none of the vacancies arose which the president sought to fill first arose while the Senate was in recess. In other words, President Obama played a waiting game in the hope that his nominees could skirt the Constitution and the Congress.\n\nA reminder. Mr. President, although you were reelected you remain bound by the Constitution. Indeed, just this week you swore on two Bibles to uphold it. Now it is time for you to remember your Oath.\n\nAttorney Lloyd Green was the opposition research counsel to the George H.W. Bush campaign in 1988, and served in the Department of Justice between 1990 and 1992.",

Image credit: Karel Navarro/AP Photo\n\nDoctors in Peru said they would operate today on a 3-year-old boy to remove the body of his would-be twin.\n\nIsbac Pacunda has the body of his twin inside his stomach \u2013 bones, eyes and even hair on the cranium. Dr. Carlos Astocondor, a plastic surgeon at the Las Mercedes Hospital in Chiclayo, told the Associated Press that the partially formed fetus weighs about a pound and a half and is 9 inches long. He and a team of 12 doctors will surgically remove the tissue from the boy\u2019s stomach today.\n\nThe condition is called fetus-in-fetu and happens in about one out of every 500,000 live births, Astocondor said. Although rare, these cases are not unheard of. In 2008, doctors removed a 2-inch embryo from the body of a 9-year-old girl in Greece. In 2006, doctors found a half-formed twin with limbs, genitalia, hair \u2014 even fingernails \u2013 in the swollen stomach of a 36-year-old Indian man.\n\nThe case spotlights the biological precision needed for twins to develop in the womb. Identical twins form when an egg splits in half right after fertilization. If the egg fails to fully separate, conjoined twins will form, sharing some portion of their bodies.\n\nDr. Jonathan Fanaroff, a neonatologist at Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland, told ABC News that some conjoined twins can live as \u201cparasites,\u201d relying on the body of the other for a blood supply and organ function. But for fetus-in-fetu, the body of one twin envelops the other during development.\n\n\u201cIn this kind of situation, because it was inside the other boy, it wasn\u2019t able to survive,\u201d Fanaroff said.\n\nSurgery to separate live, conjoined twins is extremely difficult and fraught with ethical complications. Fanaroff said the removal of Pacunda\u2019s twin will likely be much easier.",

Last year Argentina moved into first place among developing countries trading with the Russians, edging out India, the former leader.\n\nThe surge in Soviet-Argentine trade resulted from the imposition of a United States grain embargo on the Soviet Union after its military intervention in Afghanistan in late 1979. The Russians turned to Argentina for grain supplies, and Argentine exports jumped fourfold in 1980 compared with the 1979 level.\n\nLast year President Reagan rescinded the grain embargo, but by then the Russians' newly expanded trade relationship with Argentina appeared to have taken a firm hold. The volume of trade in 1981 was double the 1980 level, or more than $3.4 billion. Ranks as Sixth Largest Partner\n\nThe surge of grain shipments made Argentina the sixth-ranking trade partner of the Soviet Union outside the Soviet bloc. Argentine trade with the Russians is exceeded by that of West Germany, Finland, France, Italy and Japan and outranks Soviet trade with the United States and Britain.\n\nThe next largest Latin American trade partner of the Soviet Union, except for Cuba, is Brazil, with only a fourth of the volume of Argentina.\n\nThe new Soviet-Argentine relationship has been documented by frequent reports in the Soviet monthly magazine Foreign Trade. A long-term accord for the supply of Argentine grain and soybeans, signed in 1980, was supplemented in April 1981 by an agreement on the shipment of Argentine meat to the Soviet Union and in May 1981 by a shipping accord to provide for the transportation of these goods. New Agreements Signed\n\nWhen the Falklands crisis began with the Argentine seizure of the islands April 2, a Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Aleksei N. Manzhulo, was in Buenos Aires to sign additional accords. These provided for the establishment of mixed companies for fishing off the southern Argentine coast and for Soviet enrichment of uranium for an Argentine nuclear power station.\n\nIn 1981, according to Argentine sources, the Russians imported 15.7 million tons of grain and soybeans, or nearly 77 percent of Argentine crop exports. This represented a substantial jump from the 1980 level.\n\nDetailed figures for last year from the Soviet side are yet to be published, but in 1980 the Russians bought 50 percent of Argentina's exported wheat, 59 percent of the barley and as much as 97 percent, or 1.5 million tons, of the exported sorghum. Other Soviet purchases in 1980 included 667,000 tons of Argentine soybeans, or 27 percent of soybean exports, and 84,000 tons of frozen meat, representing 28 percent of Argentina's meat exports.\n\nBefore the surge, Soviet imports from Argentina were mainly in corn, which accounted for half the value of the far lower trade in 1979, as well as meat, wool, hides and linseed oil. 50 to 1 in Argentina's Favor\n\nThe problem for the Soviet Union has been to balance the trade, which has been running 50 to 1 in Argentina's favor. The Russians paid $3.4 billion for Argentine goods last year, compared with the Argentines' payments of $67 million for Soviet goods. Moscow has been financing its grain purchases generally with money earned from the sale of oil, mainly to Western Europe.\n\nMost of the Soviet exports to Argentina have been of electricitygenerating equipment for such projects as the Salto Grande hydroelectric station and for fuel-burning power plants at Costanera and Bahia Blanca. The Russians have also been supplying cranes, trucks, machine tools, ball-bearings and equipment for Argentina's oil and steel industries.\n\nIn an effort to increase exports to Argentina, the Soviet Union has been offering more machinery and equipment. At a session of a joint Soviet-Argentine trade commission last June, the Argentines agreed to purchase more Soviet industrial equipment over the next five years.\n\nThe session laid the groundwork for the fishery accord that was signed in Buenos Aires this month. It also envisioned Soviet participation in the Parana Medio hydroelectric project, planned on the middle reaches of the Parana River.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Argentine helicopter",

Kennedy airport in New York City.\n\nCho had quarreled with flight attendants in first class after one of them offered her bagged nuts instead of nuts served on a plate. Amid the storm of criticism, Cho resigned Tuesday as head of cabin service but remained an executive at the airline. That sparked another furor and Cho on Wednesday submitted a letter of resignation quitting all her roles.\n\nKorean Air had defended her actions as a \"natural\" attempt to improve customer service. Yet for a public that has lost patience with impunity and double standards, it was an ugly display of entitlement. The local media labeled her \"princess.\"\n\nThe Cho family has a history of making headlines in South Korea.\n\nCho, 40, who is also known as Heather Cho, is married to a prominent plastic surgeon who performed his nips and tucks in Gangnam, a tony district of Seoul famous for its plastic surgery clinics and hip shops.\n\nIn 2013, she gave birth to twin boys in Hawaii, entitling them to U.S. citizenship. Korean Air had sent Cho to work in the U.S. two months before her expected delivery date. But within South Korea there was anger that U.S. citizenship meant her sons would be able to avoid South Korea's two years of compulsory military service for able-bodied males.\n\nCho's brother, Won-tae, 38, was investigated by police in 2005 for pushing an elderly woman who confronted him about his reckless driving, the Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nThe family patriarch, Cho Yang-ho, 65, was convicted of tax evasion in 2000, facing charges with his father and brother. The Chos were charged with receiving millions in rebates when they purchased airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and evading taxes on the money.\n\nThe nut rage incident, however, struck a particular chord as it comes at a time when growing inequality and safety issues are on the minds of South Koreans. There are also growing calls to better treat service industry workers.\n\nOn an online forum used by Korean Air pilots, there was an outpouring of complaints about the behavior of the Cho family in their running of the airline.\n\nIn South Korea, there was once respect for the families that founded the industrial conglomerates that helped modernize the country and make it wealthy. Nowadays there is growing criticism of ostentatious wealth and unfettered power.\n\nThe criticism is particularly directed at the newest generation, which is inheriting the business empires founded by their fathers and grandfathers.\n\nCho and her two siblings rose quickly to the top ranks of the airline, holding executive roles in it and affiliate companies.\n\nThe Cho family, through its Hanjin conglomerate, has controlled Korean Air Lines since 1969 when it bought the monopoly state airline from the government.\n\nIt is now a major Asian carrier, but its early years were dogged by multiple plane crashes. Korean Air was also infamous for low wages and demanding schedules for pilots.\n\nThe family's direct stake in Korean Air is just 10 percent but cross-shareholdings among Hanjin companies give it effective control.",

The scorned wife turned to Wax.\n\nWax received $100,000 from the wife\u2019s family, and used half the money to hire the strongmen, according to the federal complaint.\n\nOn Oct. 17, 2010, Wax lured Briskman from Brooklyn to his home in the Garden State under the pretense of having the victim work on Talmudic books the rabbi was preparing.\n\nOnce at Wax\u2019s Lakewood home, Briskman was blindfolded, handcuffed and taken to an upstairs bedroom, where he was beaten for several hours, the criminal complaint against Wax says.\n\nWax, who wore a cowboy hat, put the victim in a body bag and threatened that if he didn\u2019t grant the \u201cget\u201d and give up custody of his children, he\u2019d be buried alive in the Pocono Mountains, according to the complaint.\n\nOnce Briskman agreed to the \u201cget,\u201d Wax made the victim call his father in Israel to demand he reimburse the wife\u2019s family $100,000.\n\nIn the call, which was secretly recorded by Briskman\u2019s father, Wax told the elder Briskman that if he didn\u2019t comply, he\u2019d receive a \u201cspecial gift \u2014 it\u2019s called a bullet ... in your head,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nWax then had his wife, Judy, drive Briskman back to Brooklyn.\n\nThe rabbi and eight co-conspirators were arrested in July 2011 following an FBI investigation.\n\nJudy Wax was also arrested.

Carefully choosing his words, B.C.

That's what the members decided,\" he said. \"In the meantime, I was elected by the entire membership [to be] leader, caucus has asked me to stay on until that leadership review and I'm proud to be able to do that.\"\n\nOntario NDP MP Charlie Angus said there were \"mixed minds\" among caucus members heading into the meeting.\n\n\"As we had those very spirited and good discussions, at the end we had a very strong sense of solidarity out of the caucus that what Tom put on offer made sense, and that we agree with and that we support,\" he said.\n\nMulcair also responded to reports that Foreign Affairs Minister St\u00e9phane Dion has signed off on export permits for the controversial $15-billion sale of light-armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, calling on the government to \"come clean.\"\n\n\"The government lied to Canadians about who signed what, when in the Saudi arms deal, and that is a very serious matter,\" he said.",

The resolution supported an Arab League plan that called for an immediate end to the violence in Syria and a political solution to the crisis. Russia was opposed to the resolution because of concerns that it could leave an opening for a foreign intervention against one of its loyal client states.\n\nThe vetoes drew harsh criticism from Security Council members that supported the resolution and who had amended it several times to ease those concerns, rewording language about the transition of power and watering down the possibility of future sanctions against the Assad regime.\n\n\u201cThe United States is disgusted that a couple of members of this Council continue to prevent us from fulfilling our sole purpose,\u201d U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said. \u201cFor months this Council has been held hostage by a couple of members,\u201d she said, referring to Russia and China, who she said had been \u201cdelaying and stripping bare any text to force Assad to stop his actions.\u201d\n\nWithout referring to Russia by name, she said the vetoes were \u201ceven more shameful\u201d given that Russia has continued to sell weapons to to Syria. She called the vetoes \u201cunforgivable\u201d and said \u201cany further blood that flows will be on their hands.\u201d\n\nIn brief remarks to the Council, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Russia actively supports an end to the violence in Syria, but that the resolution did not \u201caccurately reflect the real state of affairs\u201d in Syria and \u201csent an unbalanced signal to the parties.\u201d Churkin was speaking about armed opposition groups that have also been conducting violent attacks against the Assad regime in Syria.\n\nHe once again cited Russian concerns about \u201cregime change\u201d by \u201cinfluential members of the international community who have been undermining the possibility of a settlement in Syria.\u201d\n\nFrench Ambassador Gerard Araud said the vetoes were a \u201csad day for the UN Security Council \u2026 a sad day for democracy and a sad day for Syrians. \u2026 Hundreds of Syrians are dying and it is no longer possible to wait. \u201d\n\nPeter Wittig, the German ambassador to the United Nations criticized the vetoes particularly for having come on \u201cone of bloodiest days of the Arab spring\u201d and the 30th anniversary of the massacre in Hama, Syria ordered by Assad\u2019s father that resulted in 20,000 dead.\n\n\u201cThis is the real scandal,\u201d Wittig said. \u201cAfraid this will spur further violence and make it difficult to reach a political solution.\u201d\n\nBritish Ambassador to the U.N. Mark Lyall Grant said Russia and China should \u201cask themselves how many more deaths they are prepared to tolerate.\u201d\n\nHe said the negotiations had \u201cremoved every possible excuse\u201d for voting against the resolution. He also said that the United Kingdom and other countries would continue their efforts to stop the violence in Syria.\n\nLi Baodong, China\u2019s Ambassador to the UN told Council members that China voted against the resolution because it would \u201cfurther complicate the situation\u201d in Syria.\n\nHe also said that China supported the Russian delegation\u2019s last minute calls for a delay on the vote as well as amendments proposed by Russia that were not taken up by the Council.",

As a result, few of them are planning books about the hostages, either ''instant'' paperbacks or hard-cover editions.\n\n''Stories like that are so well covered by the news media we don't see much sense in turning things upside down to get out an instant book,'' Leona Nevler, publishing director of Fawcett Books, said, expressing a common industry viewpoint.\n\nAt least two publishers disagree, however. The Rutledge Press, a New York subsidiary of a British conglomerate, expects to publish two editions of a book about the hostages by Jan. 28, 350,000 copies of a 192-page $4.95 paperback and 50,000 hard-cover books at $8.95. They will be being published in conjunction with The Associated Press. Peter Costa, a senior editor of United Press International, said U.P.I. ''has a few publishers interested'' in a similar book.\n\nThe New American Library plans to publish a hard-cover book in the spring or summer tentatively titled ''Embassy,'' by Alex Paen, a Los Angeles radio announcer who was said to have been in Iran before and after the hostage seizure.\n\n''To be successful, an 'instant book' has to offer a dimension that you don't get from newspapers, TV or radio,'' Stuart Applebaum, publicity director of Bantam Books, said. Bantam has issued 69 instant books since reprinting the Warren Commission report in association with The New York Times in the early 60's, but it has no plans for a book about the hostages. Nor, according to their spokesmen, do such other paperback publishers as Ballantine, Pocket, Avon, Dell, Berkeley, Jove, Manor or Paragon.\n\nLawyers for the hostages will probably wait about a month before they begin approaching agents and publishers, in the opinion of Scott Meredith, the literary agent. ''But even those will be hard to sell,'' he said, ''because few people are willing to buy what is largely a rehash of what they already know. Besides, even people like myself who think that Mr. Carter handled the situation exactly right still feel ashamed and a little angry about what happened. And shame is not a very good motivation to spend $15 on a book.'' Potential Criticism\n\nThere may be another reason. ''When we did 'The Suicide Cult' about the Jonestown massacre,'' Mr. Applebaum said, ''it was commercially successful, but we took a lot of criticism from people who thought we were sensationalizing the event.'' He added, however, that Bantam's decision not to produce an instant book on the hostages was motivated strictly by editorial considerations.\n\nNevertheless, potential criticism may have helped dampen some enthusiasm for book projects. William B. Dickenson Jr. editorial director of The Washington Post Writers Group, the syndication and book-publishing arm of The Washington Post, said The Post's decision not to produce an instant book was based on the belief ''that it would be disruptive of the staff at a time when it's busy with the inauguration.'' But Mr. Dickinson added that there was also some thought ''that it might seem to be exploitive.''\n\nAlthough some instant books have sold well, one publishing executive said, ''a great many of them have suffered from very high returns. Just because you're there firstest with the mostest doesn't mean you'll make money.''\n\nThat is what bothers Timothy Waterstone, president of W.H. Smith & Son, the British conglomerate that owns Rutledge. ''We laid out a large advance for the book, which will be our first paperback,'' he said. ''And frankly, I'm already terrified by the prospect.''",

Morris, a documentarian to be reckoned with since he got a man off death row with \u201cA Thin Blue Line\u201d (1988), more recently has brought his investigative skills to the careers of two of America\u2019s most controversial secretaries of defense.\n\nIn the Oscar-winning \u201cThe Fog of War\u201d (2003), he nudged Robert McNamara, architect of the Vietnam War, into admitting his mistakes. In his newest film \u201cThe Unknown Known,\u201d he confronts Donald Rumsfeld, who helped sell the War in Iraq. Interviewed by phone recently from New York, where he was promoting the film, Morris discussed the challenge of getting a straight answer from a man who frequently says nothing.\n\nQ. My first question is the last question you asked Rumsfeld: Why did he agree to do the interview? He says he doesn\u2019t know. What do you think?\n\nA. I can\u2019t give you a definite answer for why he did it. I think he decided why not? He had just published \u201cKnown and Unknown,\u201d his memoir. I called his lawyer and he said Rumsfeld will never speak to you. So I sent a letter and included a copy of \u201cThe Fog of War.\u201d And then Rumsfeld invited me to Washington.\n\nQ. Was he cooperative? You interviewed him for more than 36 hours.\n\nA. I thought I was going to have to go to Washington or someplace like Montana or New Mexico, but he came to Boston. He was unfailingly cooperative. Since he recorded over the original tapes of his memos, he agreed to read them in the film. He was entirely forthcoming in one sense. In another sense, it was one of the most frustrating interviews I have ever done.\n\nQ. After interviewing both McNamara and Rumsfeld, which one do you think had the biggest impact on history?\n\nA. They both screwed things up. But they couldn\u2019t be more different. One is full of regret, reckoning with his past. But Donald Rumsfeld is delighted with himself and his policies. I asked would it have been better if we had not gone to Iraq at all? His answer: time will tell. The supposed insight, which is no insight at all, from someone who will never be held accountable.\n\nQ. He\u2019s still listened to, though. Recently he\u2019s been talking about the Ukraine. What\u2019s his lasting appeal?\n\nA. Your guess is as good as mine. How many times have I heard even smart people say that Rumsfeld\u2019s concatenation of words \u2014 known and unknown \u2014 is brilliant. I don\u2019t think so. He first trucks it out not in a moment of philosophical introspection but as a non-answer to a Pentagon correspondent\u2019s question \u2014 what evidence do you have that Saddam Hussein was providing terrorist organizations with weapons of mass destruction? And Rumsfeld replied that \u201cthere\u2019s the known known, the known unknown, the unknown unknown.\u201d And then he says that \u201cabsence of evidence isn\u2019t evidence of absence.\u201d He could be saying one hand washes the other or a stitch in time saves nine.\n\nQ. In \u201cStandard Operating Procedure\u201d (the 2008 film about the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison) you interviewed a CIA interrogator and he was impressed with the Interrotron. He asked how many people you had interrogated with it. You said you didn\u2019t interrogate, you interviewed. Is this a case where you wished you interrogated?\n\nA. No. It\u2019s a misunderstanding about what I do. I\u2019ve made a series of films about self-deception. This might be the most powerful example of that sort of thing. People say I didn\u2019t ask him the right questions. They forget he doesn\u2019t answer questions \u2014 he deflects them. I decided early on that I was doing something different. To try to capture something of how he sees himself.\n\nQ. You are trying to catch him in his own lies?\n\nA. The memos were the way in for me. They\u2019re not an attempt to record history \u2014 they\u2019re an attempt to obliterate history. Part of the conceit of the film is to have him read them and let him explain what they mean. Even though there may not be answers to specific questions, I believe that the non-answers, the refusal to confront what he has done, are telling. Here is a man who could say two contradictory things in one sentence and not realize it. It\u2019s hard to realize that he was once one of the most powerful men in the world. I call this a horror movie. That\u2019s exactly what it is.",

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

Milk was free because you just squirted it out of the cow. Bruce Bochy's great-grandfather first uttered the words, \"There's no getting around it,\" and the teams that became the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers played their first game.\n\nThey have met 2,361 times over 123 seasons. Through all the generations, the Giants had not shut out their ancient rivals in three consecutive games.\n\nWhen Bobby Abreu gazed at a Sergio Romo fastball to end Wednesday's 3-0 victory at AT&T Park, the deed was accomplished. The Giants met at the mound for their customary handshakes as co-leaders of the National League West.\n\n\"To be able to sweep the Dodgers, throw three shutouts and gain the position we're in says a lot about this team,\" Tim Lincecum said after an outing that said a lot about him. \"We'll just keep trying to play good ball and see where it takes us.\"\n\nSix nights ago in Oakland, Lincecum was a batter away from being yanked not only from a game but possibly the rotation. Now he has a 12-inning scoreless streak after winning for the first time since April 28 and beating the Dodgers for the first time since July 30, 2010.\n\nLike Barry Zito and Ryan Vogelsong before him, Lincecum pitched seven shutout innings and watched the bullpen finish the job, in this case, Javier Lopez and Romo. In the series, the Giants outscored the Dodgers 13-0.\n\n\"They were fun to watch,\" manager Bruce Bochy said of his pitchers. \"All of them were on top of their game, all of them were hitting their spots and Timmy was Timmy today.\"\n\nNot since 1954 against Philadelphia had the Giants swept a three-game series with three shutouts. Only twice since moving to San Francisco, in 1960 and 1988, had they pitched three consecutive shutouts, period.\n\nWith solid pitching, improved defense and a lineup that started to click, the Giants erased a 7 1/2-game deficit against the Dodgers in one month. They were five games out 11 days ago.\n\n\"This was a big series,\" said Buster Posey, who is not prone to grand statements. \"It could have gone the other way drastically. To come out of this tied is a good thing.\"\n\nFive more games and the Giants will complete half of what has been an odd season. The Dodgers surged to their huge lead as something magical seemed to be happening in Chavez Ravine, while the Giants stumbled over themselves and lost key players.\n\nNow, the Dodgers are showing how much they miss Matt Kemp, impotent at the plate and facing the loss of their other big hitter, Andre Ethier, who hurt an oblique muscle trying to break up a first-inning double play.\n\nThings should be much different when these teams next meet in the last week of July. Kemp and second baseman Mark Ellis are expected back and the Dodgers plan to be aggressive traders between now and then.\n\n\"I expect this is going to be a tight race,\" Bochy said. \"They're a good ballclub. I don't care what happened in this series. You look at Arizona and see how they're playing right now.\n\n\"It's going to be a tight race in September between these three teams. It's going to be that way the whole way. We're all going to have our ups and downs, including us. You just hope they're short ones.\"\n\nBefore the opener of the Dodgers' three-game series at the Coliseum on June 19, the Giants trailed L.A. by 4 1/2 games in the NL West.\n\nAfter sweeps by the A's and Giants of the Dodgers in the past nine days, S.F. and L.A. are tied atop the division.\n\nGreat Bay Area pitching and/or awful hitting by the Dodgers led to these stats: In the six games, Oakland and San Francisco outscored L.A. 24-2, and the Dodgers went 3-up, 3-down in 25 of 54 innings - 16 of those 25 at the Coliseum.\n\nMore of the Dodgers' offensive futility in Northern California:\n\n* All six of L.A.'s extra-base hits were doubles.\n\nHenry Schulman is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 1 sentences.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- One of California's largest health insurers - Blue Shield - announced plans to hike its premiums by as much as 59%.\n\nThe jacked up premium rates are set to take effect on March 1, pending review from state insurance regulators. The move impacts 193,000 individual Blue Shield policy holders.\n\nThe company, a member of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association with 3.3 million members, which announced the move late Thursday, stressed that its decision has \"almost nothing to do with the federal health reform law\" and that ultimately the law will help slow down health care costs.\n\nBut responding to this most recent increase the company said, \"our individual market medical costs are rising rapidly due to higher provider prices, increased utilization, and the fact that healthier people are dropping coverage during a bad economy,\" the company said.\n\nDespite the steep double-digit hike, the insurer maintained it still expects to lose tens of millions of dollars on its individual healthcare business in both 2010 and 2011.\n\nRight to be concerned: \"The people of California have a right to be concerned when they see this kind of rate increase month after month,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nSebelius said the agency has reached out to California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones as well.\n\n\"We stand ready to assist him and the people of California in any way that we can,\" she said.\n\nDespite health reform, that assistance will be limited. The federal government does not have the authority to review and strike down unreasonable rate increase requests.\n\nHistorically, that authority lies with individual states. But some states don't have any rate review process at all and insurers can hike rates as much as they want.\n\nUnder California law, the state insurance commissioner has no authority to reject excessive premium increases.\n\n\"Many Californians will no doubt be surprised to learn that the Insurance Commissioner does not have the legal authority to reject excessive health insurance premium increases,\" California Commissioner Dave Jones said in a statement Thursday.\n\nInstead, Jones has asked Blue Shield of California to delay the implementation of the rate so that he has the opportunity to ensure that the increase has been thoroughly reviewed.\n\n\"I find it stunning that Blue Shield would seek to impose such massive premium increases on policyholders during these troubling economic times,\"Jones said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"These premium increases will impose significant financial burdens on struggling families and, in some cases, will lead to the loss of health care coverage altogether,\" he said.\n\nHealth reform has tried to stymie these big rate hikes.\n\nFor instance, health reform mandates that insurance companies spend 80% to 85% of the premiums they collect on medical care instead of toward their own profits and overhead costs.\n\nHowever, that new rule doesn't seem to have affected Blue Shield's move. The company said that the new rates \"meet the federal requirement.\"\n\nOther deterrents include: $250 million in grants to states to set up a rate review process if they don't have one, and to further strengthen it if they already do. About $46 million of that amount has already been awarded to states, according to HHS.\n\nBeginning July 1, if an insurer proposes a 10% or higher rate hike, it will get extra scrutiny from state regulators as well as the federal government.\n\nIn 2014, when health exchanges are set to open, states will have the authority to ban insurers with a questionable history of rate increase from participating in the exchanges.\n\nSebelius, alluding to GOP efforts to repeal health reform, warned that without health reform, \"the practice of insurers imposing these kinds of rate increases without public scrutiny would be the wave of the future.\"\n\n\"Absolutely outrageous!\" Doug Heller, executive director of consumer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, said Blue Shield's move is shocking and that state regulators have their hand tied.\n\n\"It is absolutely outrageous that regulators in California and in most states have no power to turn back excessive hikes in health insurance premiums,\" Heller said.\n\n\"There's such a push to get every individual in this country health insurance and a mandate that everyone must have health insurance, yet regulators have their hands tied and can't limit these exorbitant premiums increases,\" he said.\n\nSince California has the largest number of uninsured people of any single state, about 7 million, Heller said the state cannot afford to have even those people who have insurance drop it be cause of rising premiums.\n\n\"By jacking up rates, insurers are pushing people off their rolls and are undermining efforts to get more consumers access to healthcare,\" he said. \"Insurance companies only want customers who can pay the premiums but don't want to pay their claims.\"\n\nFirst Published: January 7, 2011: 12:59 PM ET",

Women can be likeable. Being both is difficult to do.\n\nLast week, I was in California, the ultimate proving ground for that theory. California is the place, after all, where three well-known women \u2014 former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi \u2014 have learned that acting tough, while key to playing in big-time politics, typically does not win popularity contests.\n\nStanford Graduate Business School Professor Deborah Gruenfeld, a social psychologist who has studied power and how it works in organizations, dissected the female leadership conundrum last week at eBay\u2019s global women leaders conference in San Francisco. (I spoke there too; see last Wednesday\u2019s Postcard.) People who are viewed as powerful, Gruenfeld explained, tend to:\n\n- Occupy maximum space. - Lean back. - Slow down. - Use sweeping gestures.\n\nThe challenge for women \u2014 who still occupy only 14.4% of executive officer positions and 15.7% of board seats at Fortune 500 companies, according to Catalyst \u2014 is that guys tend to be better at using such body language. And compared to women, men are more socially accepted when they do. Gruenfeld cited an experiment in which a professor presented his students with stories of two managers, Heidi and Howard, handling the same issues with the identical behavior. The names, Heidi and Howard, were the only difference. The students judged Howard to be equally competent but less selfish and more worthy of hiring. (Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg cited this case too in her recent TEDWomen Talk, \u201cWhy We Have Too Few Women Leaders,\u201d which I wrote about and has been the buzz among women across Silicon Valley.)\n\nThe media doesn\u2019t help women feel okay about power \u2014 a point that Jennifer Siebel Newsom nails in a new documentary called Miss Representation. The film, which I saw on Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival, presents women leaders in politics, news, entertainment, and business \u2014 among them, Condoleezza Rice, Katie Couric, and Google VP Marissa Mayer \u2014 as well as top scholars talking about how the media objectifies women. The main message is that the media leads girls to care more about beauty and sexuality than their capacity to become leaders.\n\nMiss Representation is a searing critique, but it\u2019s upbeat at the end. Along comes Jessica Shambora, a Fortune writer featured as a confident young woman who is eager to inspire the next generation.\n\nJess, I assure you, is comfortable with power: She has worked, enthusiastically, on Fortune\u2018s Most Powerful Women list since she arrived at the magazine in 2008. (She started as my proteg\u00e9 and has moved way beyond that role.) On the way out of the theater, I thanked Newsom, Miss Representation\u2018s producer-director-writer, for spotlighting Jess. \u201cI saved her for the end,\u201d Newsom said, adding, \u201cYes, she\u2019s a symbol of hope.\u201d",

She was a demon. We had to destroy her.\"\n\nThe group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult.\n\nMs Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate.\n\nThe public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse.\n\nThe only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie.\n\nNo-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.\n\nSince the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",

The milieu is the Washington intelligence establishment, and the C.I.A.\u2019s former ace interrogator, Josh Ruskin (Sean Williams), is yanked out of his drunken retirement by his successor, Zack (Seth Shelden), to extract information from a renegade ex-colleague.\n\nSecrets regarding a drone have been sold to \u201cparties hostile to the United States\u201d abroad. The person under question happens to be Josh\u2019s former wife, Sunny (Kate Middleton).\n\nBut first she\u2019ll be worked on by Ford, a sadist with a metal case of preferred tools, including a nasty pair of shears. Ford (played with piercing vitriol by Rob Maitner) dismisses Josh as an alcoholic has-been, only grudgingly giving him time to induce Sunny to spill her secrets. We learn about Josh\u2019s decline and the implosion of his marriage. And we discover what Sunny has been doing since their parting, including a romantic liaison overseas.\n\n\u201cAsymmetric,\u201d a collaboration between Ground Up Productions and Gideon Productions, and developed at the Vampire Cowboys\u2019 Saturday Night Saloon series, rarely stumbles into obscure techno-speak. Mr. Rogers \u2014 working with Jordana Williams, the director and his frequent collaborator \u2014 has a keen ear for bureaucratic idioms and finely tuned pitch with narrative momentum. Just when you fear the play is heading down television-thriller avenues, it shifts direction, to address issues of national responsibility and personal accountability without a bit of fuss.\n\nMr. Shelden, as the hangdog Zack, and Mr. Maitner, as the malevolent Ford, are impeccably cast, while Ms. Middleton is equally adept with vulnerability, moral outrage and ruthless physical combat.\n\nOnly the wry, bearded Mr. Williams seems somewhat out of place, not quite as threatening (even in his loudest moments) as you might expect from a seasoned agency spook. He seems more a lover than a fighter, and apparently there\u2019s no place for such people in the C.I.A.\n\n\u201cAsymmetric\u201d continues through Dec. 6 at the 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan; 212-279-4200, 59e59.org.\n\nA version of this review appears in print on November 22, 2014, on page C4 of the New York edition with the headline: Giving His Ex-Wife the Third Degree.

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 50 words.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nThe Mets have invited Wally Backman to join them as a coach for the rest of the season, beginning next Friday in Atlanta, which is of course the wrong message to send at the moment, in light of the Ray Rice furor.\n\nBackman is a big favorite to replace Terry Collins among some observers, who choose to ignore quite a bit of history. There is no videotape of Backman\u2019s first wife, Maggie, filing for a restraining order. No tape, either, of his arrest for domestic violence in 2001, after a heated argument with his second wife that both parties categorized as nonsense, as a dispute overblown by police. There is a paper trail, however, which should not be ignored.\n\nBackman once paid heavily for his personal problems, losing the managerial job with the Arizona Diamondbacks after it was determined he lied about his past to the team\u2019s owners. He didn\u2019t tell them about the restraining order, the arrest, about a DUI or a bankruptcy. When Diamondbacks managing partner Ken Kendrick rescinded the offer to Backman, he said it was because of Backman\u2019s deception, not because of the actual arrest for domestic violence.\n\nFrom what we know, which may or may not be everything, Backman has been a model citizen recently and deserves another chance someday. Promoting him now, however, sends the wrong message. It tells the world that Sandy Alderson and the Wilpons have been asleep during the Rice affair. Or, worse yet, indifferent.\n\nIf there is proof an athlete has been guilty of domestic abuse, he ought to be suspended for a lengthy period. If a coach in any sport is found to have done the same thing, he ought to be fired immediately. If a managerial candidate is involved, he ought to be eliminated from consideration for several years.\n\nThe Rice videotape has outraged and galvanized everyone, a literal and metaphorical punch to the jaw. It has been easy to condemn Rice, to throw the bum out. Hopefully, though, the fans, owners, and media have learned something beyond such a visceral reaction to video.\n\nNow, we face tougher questions, about past transgressions and their impact on key professional job openings: Should Backman really be promoted to the Mets and considered a candidate for manager, if Terry Collins is replaced? Does Jason Kidd deserve a lucrative job coaching young, impressionable players?\n\nRule of thumb in the age of YouTube: No videotape, no outrage. For some reason, people needed to watch \u2014 over and over \u2014 Rice whack his fianc\u00e9e, in order to become enraged; in order to believe that was how this victim came to be unconscious during an elevator ride. In a better world, such visible proof ought not to be required.\n\nIn the case of Kidd, we have audio, not video. Kidd\u2019s former wife, Joumana, called 911 in Arizona in 2001, and reported, \u201cI told him this would be the last time and he popped me right in the mouth\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about me. This is minor compared to what I usually go through.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. Kidd reportedly punched his domestic partner in the face, just like Rice. Kidd pleaded guilty to a charge of spousal abuse and was later accused of attacking her again in his car, breaking her rib.\n\nBut there was no videotape then, no calls for a lengthy suspension. He was celebrated as a great point guard, a future Hall of Famer. One television pundit, who surely knew better, actually joked that Joumana needed someone to \u201csmack her.\u201d\n\nThen this summer there was essentially a bidding war for Kidd\u2019s services. He got in under the wire, before the Rice incident exploded and might have brought more attention to Kidd\u2019s past misdeeds. Kidd nearly doubled the $2.56 million per year salary he was averaging with the Nets. His unsavory past was ignored, in Brooklyn and Milwaukee.

Further, the groups said, ''It is impossible to devise a prayer that is acceptable to all groups. Any effort to do so trivializes prayer by robbing it of depth and meaning.''\n\nIn addition, many religious leaders emphasize that permitting organized school prayer would not only improperly foster religion but also coerce nonbelievers or members of minorities into religious practices with which they did not agree. Catholic Stand More Qualified\n\nWhile most large Protestant, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish groups staunchly resist any form of school prayer, the position of the Roman Catholic Church is somewhat more qualified. In response to the President's proposal, the United States Catholic Conference said it would stand by a statement issued by its administrative board in 1973, favoring school prayer only if it was linked to a means to allow religious instruction in the schools.\n\nA prayer amendment alone ''would be inadequate to meet the needs of the nation,'' the statement said, adding, ''The amendment needed must cover school prayer and religious instruction.''\n\nUnder those terms, it would appear unlikely that the church could endorse a Presidential proposal that includes only a provision for prayer without the Catholic bishops' shifting ground.\n\nThe most ardent supporters of school prayer are fundamentalist Christians, who contend that the Constitution forbids sectarian prayer but does not intend to shut out religious practice altogether. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the most visible backer of the plan, maintains that nobody was ever harmed by prayer.\n\nFurthermore, for many fundamentalists the issue carries highly symbolic value. As many of these Christians feel more challenged by secular values, they see religion's impact on America fading further as the result of court decisions that, in their view, constitute an attack on religion itself. Amendment Could Be a Sign\n\nSeen from their viewpoint, the successful passage of a school prayer amendment could be taken as a sign that the Government supports their beliefs and underscores the crucial role of religion in giving America a unique, providential mission.\n\nBut a far more prominent case against school prayer has been gaining force among a broad spectrum of the large historic denominations, including Southern Baptists, whose enthusiasm for making conversions does not lead to any softening of their commitment to the principle of strict separation of church and state.\n\nBasically, these groups accept the reasoning of the 1962 Supreme Court decision that outlawed mandated school prayer. They argue that religion is best served by keeping piety out of the classroom. It is the responsibility of parents and churches to nurture religious practice and values, they contend, and any attempt by the Government to lend support to religion is a threat to the individual's right to personal beliefs.\n\n''The religious training of children is the responsibility of the family and the church,'' said Claire Randall, general secretary of the National Council of Churches. ''It is not the responsibility of the Government at any level.'' A Question of Fairness\n\nAn amendment to allow voluntary prayer ''is unfair to members of religious groups that are in the minority,'' a council statement said, adding: ''Any child can pray to God anytime, any place and in any language. We rejoice in that freedom and want to protect it. That goal can best be achieved by keeping prayer the province of the individual, the family, the religious community - not of the state.''\n\nThe Synagogue Council of America, an umbrella organization of Reform, Conservative and Orthodox groups, said, ''Even voluntary prayer is bound to be a divisive force, inasmuch as some children may find themselves unable to participate.''\n\nThe larger joint statement by the Jewish and Christian groups delineates the underlying rationale for opposing the proposed amendment. On the one hand, there is repeated recognition of the need for prayer and the sacredness of the individual's religious life. On the other hand, there is a warning:\n\n''To a child in a classroom, no part of the school routine is voluntary,'' the coalition said. ''Religion does not need, and should not have, the sponsorship or support of government.''",

But Colonna's lawyer argued she had no control over when or how Best would read and respond to the message.\n\nState Superior Court Judge David Rand sided with Colonna's lawyer, dismissing claims against the woman in a lawsuit filed by crash victims David and Linda Kubert, who are also suing Best. David Kubert had his left leg torn off above the knee, while his wife eventually had her left leg amputated.\n\nStephen Weinstein, the Kuberts' attorney, has argued that Colonna should have known Best was driving and texting her at the time. He argued that while Colonna was not physically present at the wreck, she was \"electronically present,\" and he asked for a jury to decide Colonna's liability in the case.\n\nBut Colonna testified at a deposition she didn't know whether Best was driving at the time.\n\nBest has pleaded guilty to distracted driving, admitting he was using his cellphone and acknowledging a series of text messages he exchanged with Colonna around the time of the accident; the content of the messages is unknown. Records show Best responded to a text from Colonna seconds before dialing 911.\n\nBest was ordered to speak to 14 high schools about the dangers of texting and driving and had to pay about $775 in fines, but his driver's license was not suspended.\n\nLawyers for Best and Colonna declined to comment after the hearing, and neither couple was in court.\n\nWeinstein said Friday the Kuberts are disappointed with the decision and an appeal will be filed, but the couple is hopeful the attention the case has drawn will lead to change.\n\n\"Even though the case against Shannon Colonna has been dismissed, they are gratified that if by bringing the case they have accomplished the goal of making people think before they text, whether while driving or while the recipient is driving,\" he said.\n\nRand said it's reasonable for text message senders to assume the recipients will behave responsibly, and he also noted drivers are bombarded with many forms of distraction, whether they be text messages, notifications from smartphones, GPS devices or signs along the road.\n\n\"Were I to extend this duty to this case, in my judgment, any form of distraction could potentially serve as the basis of a liability case,\" Rand said.\n\nBut Rand stressed his decision shouldn't be read as minimizing the need for attentiveness while driving, and he said Americans have become \"almost addicted\" to wireless communication.\n\n\"That is the reality of today's world,\" he said.\n\nWeinstein hopes for proceedings to move forward within the next several months.",

Mansfield M. Kaseman, a minister in the National Union Presbytery in Washington, was asked at his ordination, ''Would you affirm that Jesus Christ is in fact God?'' The minister responded, ''Jesus Christ is one with God,'' and his explanation of the answer led some to challenge the propriety of his ordination.\n\nQuestions Raised 1,600 Years Ago\n\nBy insisting that Presbyterian clergy affirm the confessional statements of the church, the denomination is in effect asking future ministers to endorse the views expressed when questions about Jesus' being truly human and divine were raised in the early centuries of Christianity.\n\nFollowers of the theologian Arius in the fourth century held that Jesus was only human; a council of the whole church, held at Nicea in A.D. 325, ruled that viewpoint heresy. Councils of that era also condemned the opinion that Jesus was not truly human, but only ''appeared'' to be a man, a heresy known as docetism.\n\nElements of those 1,600-year-old debates appeared at the Houston meeting, and by appealing to the ancient creeds of the Christian church included in the Presbyterian book of confessions, or statements of belief, the delegates made it clear that they were adhering to the viewpoint that Jesus was, in the words of the creed from the Council of Nicea, ''true God from true God,'' who ''came down from heaven ... and became man.''\n\nThe resolution, passed on an overwhelming voice vote, conceded that some elements of the doctrine ''can never be fully explained,'' but said that belief in the divinity and humanity of Jesus ''ties Christians together in faith and life across the centuries.'' 'Clarity and Confidence' Seen\n\nPreviously, the question put to candidates for the ministry only asked if they would be ''instructed by the confessions of our church and led by them as you lead the people of God.'' The new wording inserts the reference to the confessions as ''authentic and reliable'' expositions of the Bible.\n\n''The actions here should bring clarity and confidence to disturbed congregations,'' said the Rev. Charles A. Hammond of West Lafayette, Ind., a former church moderator. A number of congregations had threatened to withdraw from the denomination over the issue.\n\nThe General Assembly of the Southern church closed yesterday, and the United Presbyterians are to end their meeting today. Both churches endorsed steps toward a merger of the denominations into a 3.1-million-member church in 1983. A number of presbyteries, the regional units of the churches, are already merged, but the denominations maintain separate national structures.\n\nIn other action, the General Assemblies of both churches voted to abolish the little-used penalty of excommunication for heresy or other infractions.\n\n''The power which Christ has given the church is for building up and not for destruction, for the dispensing of mercy rather than of wrath,'' said a preface to the new rules.\n\nExcommunion, which bars people from taking the sacraments, is rarely exercised, but the penalty is still in the books of displine of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. Disciplinary procedures retain provisions for rebuke, temporary suspension from office or removal from office after a church trial.",

But putting Edwards on the stand was also a gamble: It would have exposed him to withering cross-examination about his past lies and personal failings. The judge told jurors that no more witnesses would be called and closing arguments would be Thursday, with the jury likely beginning deliberations Friday.\n\nEdwards is charged with six criminal counts including conspiracy to violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, accepting contributions that exceeded campaign finance limits, and causing his campaign to file a false financial disclosure report. He faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines if convicted of all charges.\n\nAt the trial, prosecutors have shown two members of Edwards\u2019 inner circle, campaign finance chairman Fred Baron and once-close aide Andrew Young, engaged in a yearlong cover-up to hide the married presidential candidate\u2019s mistress from the media. Young, who is married, falsely claimed paternity of his boss\u2019 baby and received $725,000 in secret checks from an elderly heiress, using some of the money to care for Hunter.\n\n(MORE: Did the Obama Campaign Know about John Edwards\u2019 Affair?)\n\nBaron, a wealthy Texas lawyer, provided Young and Hunter with more than $400,000 in cash, luxury hotels, private jets and a $20,000-a-month rental mansion in Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\nEdwards\u2019 wife, Elizabeth, died of cancer in December 2010. He is now a single parent of two school-aged children, ages 13 and 11, who live with their father at the family\u2019s gated estate outside Chapel Hill. Edwards\u2019 30-year-old daughter Cate is a lawyer who married last year.After years of denials, Edwards admitted fathering his Hunter\u2019s baby in January 2010, shortly after agreeing to pay child support.

Looked tired. Lacked moments of grace and optimism. His usual tense, awkward tics all were on vivid display, perhaps heightened by a bad two weeks.\n\nSubstance: Overall, a little vague, especially when talking about the economy.\n\nHis worst moment: Still unable to give a smooth answer to the tax returns question, despite obvious intensive preparation.\n\nHis best moment: A crude, inartful but sustained attack on Gingrich\u2019s ethics and Freddie Mac ties eventually wore Newt down, capped by a stark \u201cinfluence peddling\u201d line.\n\nThe main thing: Dominated much of the night by systematically unloading his latest opposition research on Gingrich but never created a moment that truly broke through. His focus on his chief GOP rival meant he didn\u2019t drive his anti-Obama message as much as usual. Regained his former presidential mien and seemed to be the only candidate who at least partially fulfilled a game plan on the stage, successfully breaking the circuit on the South Carolina debate dynamic. But his muted killer instinct and apparent worry about making an error diminished an otherwise solid performance.\n\nStyle: Low-key, confident delivery. Mostly adept at deflecting charges.

Like his chief rival, looked and sounded tired.\n\nSubstance: Talked tough on Cuba, out-pandering Romney to the Cuban-American community.\n\nHis worst moment: Chose not to rebut Romney\u2019s initial flurry of hard charges.\n\nHis best moment: His recitation of his long history in the conservative movement contrasted mightily with Romney\u2019s weaker response immediately before.\n\nThe main thing: Played more defense than offense with Romney. Unable to draw on energy from the hall as in South Carolina, since Tampa crowd involvement was near zippo. Rarely got to play his recent winning cards: media bashing, liberal elite bashing, Obama bashing. This debate won\u2019t necessarily slow his momentum but it will not add another rocket.\n\nStyle: An air of resignation until the very end, when he showed some passion; otherwise low energy like everyone else.\n\nSubstance: Little opportunity to flaunt his stuff but displayed his smarts on occasion and gave a strong answer on housing issues.\n\nHis worst moment: After being largely shut out of the opening Romney-Gingrich colloquy, failed to seize his moment with differentiating riff.\n\nHis best moment: Reprised his impressive him-versus-Romney/Gingrich comparison on conservative credentials from the South Carolina debate (but managed it only in the debate\u2019s closing moments).\n\nThe main thing: If voters are turned off by Romney-Gingrich jousting, he might have scooped up some votes just by staying out of the mess. Solid throughout \u2014 but solid isn\u2019t enough any more.\n\nStyle: Played the role of calm wise-cracker rather than intense slasher.\n\nSubstance: Again missed too many opportunities to explain himself and show off his distinct agenda to a wider audience.\n\nHis worst moment: Still seems squirrelly on whether he will run outside the GOP if he loses the nomination \u2013 because he IS being squirrelly about it.\n\nHis best moment: His mini-lecture on the macroeconomics of the housing crisis was accessible and clear.\n\nThe main thing: His heart seemed less into the competition than in past debates, perhaps because he isn\u2019t overexerting himself in Florida\u2019s winner-take-all contest.",

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",

Requiring companies to devote 20 percent of their ad space to the city\u2019s \u201cmisleading\u201d message violates their free-speech rights and would force them to limit their advertising in San Francisco, he said.\n\nThe beverage association, joined by the California Retailers Association and the California State Outdoor Advertising Association, is seeking an injunction to block enforcement of the label requirement, which was unanimously approved by the Board of Supervisors in June and is scheduled to take effect July 25. It would be the first such law in the nation.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edward Chen asked probing questions of both sides during an 80-minute hearing and did not say how he would rule. But he seemed skeptical of some of Bress\u2019 argument, asking the lawyer why the warnings were any different than those the federal government requires for cigarettes, or for medications with dangerous side effects.\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that cigarettes increase the risk of lung cancer, Bress replied, but no reliable evidence that sugared beverages are more hazardous than other sources of calories. But Chen said the government might be entitled to single out high-calorie products like sodas that \u201cpeople are more susceptible to, are more enticing, are more easily available.\u201d\n\nDeputy City Attorney Jeremy Goldman told Chen the city isn\u2019t suggesting that sugary drinks are uniquely dangerous, but has good reasons for singling them out \u2014 a single 20-ounce can of soda, he said, contains more sugar than the Food and Drug Administration recommends consuming in a day. Pressed by Chen, Goldman denied that the city would be \u201cchilling\u201d advertisers\u2019 free speech.\n\nThe hearing comes as supporters of a one-cent-per-ounce tax on sugared drinks are gathering signatures to place the measure on the November ballot in San Francisco. An earlier two-cent tax to fund health programs won 55.6 percent of the vote in 2014 but fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The new measure would need only a majority vote because the money would go to the city\u2019s general fund.\n\nBob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: begelko@sfchronicle.com",

We discussed the favorable ingredients in place: a cold arctic high pressure center to the north and a moisture-rich area of low pressure passing to our south. Despite being late into March, the setup had the makings of a classic D.C. snow event.\n\nAnd we predicted accumulating snow. Just not enough. Not nearly enough.\n\nOur Sunday afternoon forecast was for 2-4 inches for most of the region, except 3-6 inches in our colder suburbs to the west, and 1-3 inches around city. (Yes, we increased totals Sunday evening to 3-6\u2033 for most of the region, 4-7\u2033 for our western areas, and 2-4 inches for the city, but that was too little, too late.)\n\nUpdated CWG snowfall forecast as of 2:30 p.m. March 16.\n\nIn reality, a general 6-10 inches fell over most of the region (a few areas south/southeast of town were in the 4-6\u2033 range, and a few places west and northwest hit double digits).\n\nBasically, we forecast only about half the amount of snow that fell.\n\nWe underestimated the cold air\n\nAs temperatures on Saturday had hit 70, and even on Sunday climbed into the upper 40s, we were skeptical temperatures would cool quickly enough for significant accumulations during the first half of the storm (Sunday evening) \u2013 particularly around the city. (We further reasoned the warm ground would melt flakes, which it did, to an extent.)\n\nWe fully recognized the arctic air feeding the storm would eventually allow accumulation, it just happened faster than we thought.\n\nIt\u2019s totally possible we were influenced by past events when the air did not cool as fast as models predicted. But, in this case, the cold air mass was impressive and we should\u2019ve put more faith in all of the indicators (i.e. low dew points, temperatures in the teens in northern Pennsylvania Sunday afternoon, low atmospheric thicknesses, cold high altitude temperatures).\n\nThe heavy precipitation band shifted north slightly\n\nIn the days leading up to the storm, models were shifting their forecasts for the heaviest precipitation to fall south of D.C. On Sunday, that shift stopped and there was even a subtle shift back north in some of the models. It turned out that the heaviest snow bands set up right over the D.C. area \u2013 focused on our west and north suburbs \u2013 rather than south.\n\nAll winter long we\u2019ve talked about how tough it is pinpoint exactly where these bands will focus. In most storms, these bands have ended up slightly north of where the models suggest. We took that into consideration with this storm, but not quite enough.\n\nKudos to the National Weather Service\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted 4-8 inches for the metro region (increasing the forecast to 5-10\u2033 late last night), more than we did, and overall had one of the better forecasts in the area for this storm. It also did a nice job at highlighting the (relatively high) probabilities that snow could exceed 4 inches well in advance (starting Friday).\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think our reasons for being conservative in our forecasts for this storm were necessarily bad ones, but we should\u2019ve done a better job at evaluating the available cold air.\n\nForecasting snow amounts is hard and humbling.\n\nAs always, our entire team worked hard to provide a carefully-considered forecast and comprehensive storm coverage. We correctly predicted an unusual late season accumulating snowstorm that would cause disruptions in the region, but fell short of forecasting what turned out to be a historic storm.\n\nDo you agree? As always, we welcome your feedback\u2026",

Osborne had asked the commission to come up with ways to improve the banking system and make banking executives more accountable for their actions after the financial crisis and a handful of recent banking scandals.\n\n\u201cThe government is determined to raise standards across the banking industry to create a stronger and safer banking system,\u201d Osborne said in a statement. \u201cCultural reform in the banking sector marks the next step in the government\u2019s plan to move the whole sector from rescue to recovery,\u201d he said.\n\nThe steps are part of the government\u2019s wider efforts to restore trust in the banking sector as a way to support a recovery of the British economy. Osborne said that he hoped a more stable banking system would increase lending to businesses, spur growth, and create more jobs.\n\nA string of trading scandals and continued high pay for some of Britain\u2019s bankers have led to widespread public anger and prompted the government to look into tightening rules on conduct and pay.\n\nThe government plans to make \u201creckless misconduct for senior bankers\u201d a criminal offense. Those found guilty could face a prison sentence.\n\nThe step would be \u201ca helpful deterrent\u201d against senior executives risking giant losses at banks that would result in a government bailout and cost taxpayers billions of dollars, officials say.\n\nBritish lawmakers said the new legislation is aimed at making financiers more cautious when deciding on the bank\u2019s strategy and investments.\n\nPublic anger in Britain has focused on Frederick A. Goodwin, who managed Royal Bank of Scotland when it went on an ill-advised acquisition spree. He left the bank with a large retirement package as the government had to rescue the bank and the banking system from the brink of collapse.\n\nOsborne also pledged to work with the financial regulators to allow bonuses to be deferred for as many as 10 years and for entire bonuses to be clawed back at banks that required government aid.",

Image credit: Stone/Getty Images.\n\nSmartphone autocorrect is famous for scrambling messages into unintelligible gibberish but when one man received this garbled text from his 11-week-pregnant wife, it alarmed him:\n\n\u201cevery where thinging days nighing,\u201d her text read. \u201cSome is where!\u201d\n\nThough that may sound like every text you\u2019ve ever received, the woman\u2019s husband knew her autocorrect was turned off. Fearing some medical issue, he made sure his 25-year-old wife went immediately to the emergency room.\n\nWhen she got there, doctors noted that she was disoriented, couldn\u2019t use her right arm and leg properly and had some difficulty speaking. A magnetic resonance imaging scan \u2014 MRI \u2014 revealed that part of the woman\u2019s brain wasn\u2019t getting enough blood. The diagnosis was stroke.\n\nFortunately, the story has a happy ending. A short hospital stay and some low-dose blood thinners took care of the symptoms and the rest of her pregnancy was uneventful.\n\nClick here to read about how texting pedestrians risk injuries\n\nThe three doctors from Boston\u2019s Harvard Medical School, who reported the case study online in this week\u2019s Archives of Neurology, claim this is the first instance they know of where an aberrant text message was used to help diagnose a stroke. In their report, they refer to the woman\u2019s inability to text properly as \u201cdystextia,\u201d a word coined by medical experts in an earlier case.\n\nDystextia appears to be a new form of aphasia, a term that refers to any trouble processing language, be it spoken or written. The authors of the Archives paper said that at least theoretically, incoherent text messages will be used more often to flag strokes and other neurological abnormalities that lead to the condition.\n\n\u201cAs the accessibility of electronic communication continues to advance, the growing digital record will likely become an increasingly important means of identifying neurologic disease, particularly in patient populations that rely more heavily on written rather than spoken communication,\u201d they wrote.\n\nEven though jumbled texts are so common, Dr. Larry Goldstein, a neurologist who is the director of the stroke center at Duke University, said he also believes it\u2019s possible they can be used to sound the alarm on a person\u2019s neurological state, especially in a case like this where the text consisted of complete words that amounted to nonsense rather than the usual autocorrected muddle.\n\n\u201cIt would have been very easy to dismiss because of the normal problems with texting but this was a whole conversation that wasn\u2019t making sense,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cI might be concerned about a patient based on a text like this if they were telling me they hadn\u2019t intended to send a disjointed jumble but they weren\u2019t able to correct themselves.\u201d\n\nIn diagnosing stroke, Goldstein said both patients and medical professionals tend to discount aphasic symptoms, even in speech, but they can often be the first clue something is up. In this woman\u2019s case, other signs were there. Her obstetrician realized in retrospect that she\u2019d had trouble filling out a form earlier in the day. She had difficulties speaking too which might also have been picked up sooner if a recent upper respiratory infection hadn\u2019t reduced her voice to a whisper.\n\nBut unlike this woman, most people leave their autocorrect turned on. If we relied solely on maddeningly unintelligible text messages to determine neurological state, neurologists might have lines out the door.",

But the president went beyond that in his victory speech and added some less familiar words to his policy vocabulary.\n\nChildren should live in a world that is not burdened by debt or weakened by inequality, he said, but also one \u201cthat isn\u2019t threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\u201d That suggests he knows he has an opportunity to address climate change with more vigor, going beyond auto-mileage standards and renewable-energy jobs to possibly advocating tougher carbon emissions standards.\n\nThe president also said he was looking forward to working with Republicans to fix the immigration system, giving him a chance to do more than promote the Dream Act for young immigrants. He could lead the way to comprehensive reform that combines strong enforcement with a path to citizenship for immigrants already here. He also hinted that combating poverty might move higher on his priority list.\n\nAnd he spoke of tax reform, an issue that will immediately begin to grow louder with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts at year\u2019s end. Mr. Obama won re-election on an unambiguous promise not to renew those cuts for incomes of $250,000 or more, and his supporters expect him to stick to that vow. In coming months, after he persuades Congress to keep taxes from rising on the middle class, he should push to restore a fair estate tax and raise the low capital gains rate to the level of ordinary income.\n\nHe even mentioned the need to fix a balloting system that left thousands of people standing in long lines to vote this week, a tantalizing hint that electoral reform might become a priority.\n\nAll these agenda items require the same ingredient: ending his standoffish attitude toward Congress and working closely with any leader or lawmaker willing to make real progress. That may be easier now that Senate Democrats (and their independent allies) have expanded their majority by two seats to 55, many of them filled with newcomers more liberal and feisty than their predecessors, most notably Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nThe new Democratic caucus\u2019s first order of business should be a reform of the filibuster that prevents its routine abuse by Republicans, and the majority leader, Harry Reid, suggested Wednesday that he supported some modest changes. The newcomers, along with the White House, should forcefully advocate that he go as far as possible.\n\nA newly energized Obama administration and Senate could have the effect of isolating the supply-side dead-enders in the House. John Boehner, the House speaker, announced Wednesday that nothing had changed; he and his caucus still oppose higher tax rates for the rich and still want to pursue Mr. Romney\u2019s defeated goal of raising revenue by lowering rates and cutting unspecified loopholes. Standing up to Republican recalcitrance on this and many other issues will require bringing to bear political pressure from the coalition that gave Mr. Obama a commanding victory in the Electoral College on Tuesday.\n\nThe president\u2019s victory was decisive, and many who didn\u2019t support him nonetheless told pollsters that they agreed with his positions on taxes, health care and immigration. He now needs to use the power that voters have given to him to enhance and broaden his agenda.",

His invention would allow skiers to answer their iPhones or Android devices with a finger swipe, read short text messages and view the time, temperature and elevation.\n\nBut now Griesel needs help putting his invention into more hands. He\u2019s turning to crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to raise $100,000 to mass produce his \u201csmart ski poles.\u201d\n\nSo far, 60 people have invested nearly $9,000 for the \u201cNeva\u201d ski poles project.\n\nIf funded, the poles would feature 0.96-inch OLED screen, Bluetooth adapter, rechargeable battery, rubber grips and dual density plastic. The poles would also come with a app to manage settings, calculate slope data and track routes.\n\nFor adventurous back-country skiers, the Neva poles\u2019 screen would display slope angle and terrain details.\n\nCreative minds routinely use Kickstarter, which has seen 2 million backers dish out $200 million since 2008.\n\nWhile not all projects reach their funding goals, some people have found major success on Kickstarter. One project \u2014 to produce watches that interact with your smartphone \u2014 is sold out, raising more than $10 million with 6 days left for people to invest.\n\nWould you use these poles on a ski slope or lift?\n\nThis project uses a box and an old monitor to simulate virtual reality. It is an incredibly cool project, but its Kickstarter backers shouldn't expect anything in return other than a \"big happy thank you.\"\n\nTwo lifelong Canadian friends have found a way to resurrect vintage boomboxes from the '80s. The Decentralized Dance Party is a portable, battery-operated \"party system\" consisting of thousands of people carrying stereos. A DJ carries an FM transmitter in a backpack, and tunes the boomboxes to his master FM broadcast, resulting in a mobile, synchronized sound.\n\nThe pair is attempting to bring the dance party to Seattle, and to many others cities in the future.\n\nIn place of a traditional wedding cake, this couple opted for a five-foot towering donut pedestal.\n\nNow, with your support, the two are hoping to create a reusable donut tower in multiple sizes and configurations. They plan to market the prototype to donut shops, caterers and anyone else interested in the dessert presentation.\n\nThis quirky Kickstarter hopes to introduce \"the silliest brand of toilet paper you could ever imagine\" to the shelves of major retailers. The founder of this project has been making novelty toilet paper since 1998, but he's excited to launch \"the only brand of toilet paper with a sense of humor.\"\n\nThis successfully funded project involves a half-kilometer-long marble chute that's been intricately laser cut out of 3mm, high-density fiberwood. It slightly beats the current record of 210.31 meters. View the world's longest marble chute here.\n\nLeave behind all the heavy instruments. The Imaginary Marching Band gloves allow the wearer to pantomime music using various open-source instruments. The project successfully met its funding goal.\n\nYou've heard about people who've seen the Virgin Mary in their coffee cups, or Abe Lincoln on their dinner plates. Now you too can experience a sandwich vision. A young couple successfully funded and created an electronic sandwich press that toasts the face of Jesus onto bread.\n\nHigh school and college students built this set of robotic pipe organs that anyone can play and watch over the Internet. This project met its funding, and can be viewed here.\n\nLooking to grab attention at a party? Consider adding a little dry ice to your drink - but do it safely. This unique glass allows the drinker to enjoy dry ice \"smoke\" without worrying about frostbite. It was originally created to improve the martini, but the project is hoping to market a novelty glass that makes any beverage smoke like a cauldron.\n\nNow you can have your cup, drink out of it and eat it too! These biodegradable vegan cups are flavored to pair with the beverage they contain. If you choose not to consume your cup, it will turn to compost. The project was completely funded and will be available for sale soon.\n\n\"For men who are going places,\" this Kickstarter was inspired by one of the top political scandals of 2011 involving Anthony Weiner.

Losev, the director general of Tass, expressed amazement that Mr. Reagan's proposals had attracted favorable attention in Western Europe. ''What can Western Europe gain from this?'' he asked. ''Absolutely nothing! It is inexplicable therefore why some Western European politicians are rejoicing now.''\n\nMr. Losev suggested that Moscow was prepared to treat Mr. Reagan's suggestions as negotiable. ''We would like to believe, of course, that the U.S. Administration has not had its final say on the issue, which is so important for the destinies of peace in Europe, and not only in Europe, for that matter.''\n\nIgor Fesunenko, a leading Soviet television commentator, told viewers: ''To an absolutely ignorant people, these suggestions would appear logical and even promising. But in reality they are sheer demagoguery.''\n\nMr. Fesunenko said the Reagan initiative would require the Soviet Union to dismantle its European nuclear missiles while the West retained nearly 1,000 missiles, either based on American planes and submarines or belonging to England or France. ''Does he take us for fools, or does he just want to endanger the very basis of the planned negotiations?'' Mr. Fesunenko said.\n\nA primary Soviet concern over Mr. Reagan's statements, Western diplomats said, was apparently their potential for upstaging Mr. Brezhnev's visit to West Germany, which begins Sunday.\n\nA Tass preview of Mr. Brezhnev' s visit, written by Anatoly A. Krasikov, the deputy director of the agency, underlined the themes that the Soviet leader is expected to raise in Bonn. Mr. Krasikov wrote that the official visit was taking place ''at a moment when the United States prepares to unleash another round of the arms race - and maybe even war - under cover of a clamor about a mythical 'Soviet military threat.' ''\n\nThe attacks on Mr. Reagan's speech were echoed in several major Soviet bloc newspapers, according to excerpts published by Tass. An example was the Czechoslovak daily Rude Pravo, which was quoted as saying: ''There has been no change in the policy of the American ruling circles. At present prospects for military detente are even dimmer than before.'' No Government Statement\n\nThe initial Soviet criticism Wednesday was made in the form of a Tass dispatch from Washington, not as a formal Government statement from Moscow, and there was no Government statement today.\n\nThe articles by Mr. Losev and others outlined anew the figures used by the Soviet Union in its contention that Eastern and Western forces are roughly balanced in Europe. Mr. Reagan said yesterday that the Soviet Union was six times stronger than the West in intermediate nuclear forces.\n\nThe Soviet rejoinder is that American figures do not take into account 700 bombers of the forward-based force in Europe, the Poseidon missiles on American submarines and the nuclear potential of Britain and France.\n\nMoscow also contends that there is a rough parity in conventional forces in Europe. Tass said today NATO had 4.9 million soldiers on active duty against 4.7 million in the Warsaw Pact. Of these, Tass said 991,000 NATO troops are stationed in Central Europe, compared with 979,000 Soviet bloc forces.",

            "answer": "The Soviet press broadened its attack today on President Reagan's proposal for eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe, but a senior information official said Moscow hoped the President's proposal was not his ''final say on the issue.''   Leading Soviet commentators from major newspapers, the Government press agency Tass and Soviet television joined in denouncing Mr.  Reagan's offer to forgo deployment of new American missiles in Europe if the Soviet Union dismantles its missiles targeted on Western Europe.   Writing in the Government newspaper Izvestia, Sergei A. Losev, the director general of Tass, expressed amazement that Mr. Reagan's proposals had attracted favorable attention in Western Europe. ''What can Western Europe gain from this?'' he asked. ''Absolutely nothing!  It is inexplicable therefore why some Western European politicians are rejoicing now.''"

But there's still the major question: Why?\n\nResearchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to get a closer look at the brains of both bilinguals and monolinguals, comparing how their activity differs during specific tasks. This new study, published Tuesday in the Journal of Neuroscience, expands upon previous ideas that bilinguals tend to show superior task-switching abilities compared to monolinguals. The study was led by Brian Gold of the University of Kentucky in Lexington.\n\nScientists recruited 110 people who all took a survey about language background, abilities and frequency of usage. \"Lifelong bilinguals\" were defined as people who are fluent in two languages, specifically those who spoke English and another language every day since age 10 or younger. There was a variety of languages represented among the bilinguals, which adds to the strength of the experiments, said Judith Kroll, professor of linguistics and psychology at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in this study.\n\nBilinguals and monolinguals scored about the same, on average, on tests of simple working memory. But in experiments where participants were switching between perceptual tasks, the older adult bilinguals were faster than the older adult monolinguals.\n\nGenerally among younger participants, performance did not appear to be related to bilingual vs. monolingual status.\n\n\"The fact that only the older bilinguals reveal these differences also demonstrates that this isn't a simple effect,\" Kroll said. \"After all, the older lifelong bilinguals were once younger lifelong bilinguals.\"\n\nThe pattern of brain activity observed in adult bilinguals was similar to what the researchers saw in younger adults. Their better performance appeared to require \"less activation in several frontal brain regions linked with effortful processing,\" the study said. In other words, the older bilinguals were using their brains more efficiently than the older monolinguals.\n\n\"This suggests that neural efficiency may represent a core underlying mechanism of the bilingual task-switching advantage in aging,\" the study authors wrote.\n\nThe researchers did not find significant differences in the volumes of key brain regions between monolinguals and bilinguals, suggesting that size was not a factor in performance.\n\nAs with many fMRI studies, the sample size in this series of experiments was relatively small. The cost of the fMRI process often limits the number of participants in studies of this nature. Further research with more participants should be done to confirm the results.\n\nBased on this study, it's unclear whether starting to learn a second language later in life would give the same cognitive benefits as lifelong bilingualism. A different study could compare people who had begun language acquisition at various ages.\n\nThe cognitive benefits of being bilingual in old age, as observed in this study, could be considered analogous to brain benefits from exercise and other kinds of training seen in other research. Kroll noted that if that is the case, then perhaps the age of language acquisition isn't so important, but more research needs to be done in order to verify this.\n\nKroll said the study \"makes an exciting contribution\" to this line of research about the cognitive advantages of being bilingual in old age. There had been some skepticism about whether it was truly the knowledge of two languages that's linked to particular benefits in aging, or some other underlying characteristic that bilinguals have.\n\n\"We and others have suggested that bilinguals are 'mental jugglers' for whom the continuous activity of both languages imposes the demand to select the intended language, but we are still at an early stage of understanding how language experience specifically produces the sort of neural efficiency reported in this study,\" Kroll said.\n\nGet a behind-the-scenes look at the latest stories from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen and the CNN Medical Unit producers.

I honor his personal life, I respect his personal life, but this is about how you behave in the public arena.\u201d\n\nFormer White House press secretary turned campaign adviser Robert Gibbs called Romney a \u201cpolitical gymnast of the highest order.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will say virtually anything to get elected to any office,\u201d Gibbs said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one thing that is certain in this Republican primary, if you don\u2019t like where Mitt Romney is today, just wait until tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the weather. \u201d\n\nBoth men, who helped orchestrate a similar line of attack against Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, rebuffed the suggestion that the negative and personal campaign is improper.\n\n\u201cHe seems to think that every day is a new day, that he can simply change all of his positions depending on who his audience is or what the political circumstances. And that is not what you want in the president of the United States,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cSo is that an issue? Yes, that\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nRomney defended himself against the \u201cno core\u201d charge in an interview with ABC News last month, insisting his record as a businessman and governor \u201cdemonstrates what I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that politics is politics,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cPeople look for some edge they can get. But \u2014 but people know how I\u2019ve lived my life and what I believe on the major issues of the day. And frankly, I\u2019m in this race, because of the failure of President Obama to turn around this economy. \u201d\n\nRepublican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus today, appearing after Axelrod, picked up on that theme, saying that if character is a 2012 campaign issue then Obama won\u2019t pass the test.\n\n\u201cHe made some promises in regard to the debt, which he didn\u2019t fulfill. He made some big promises in regard to the deficit. He said he would cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term and what did he do? He passed, or he put forward, the biggest structural deficit in the history of America,\u201d Priebus said.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is going to be the bigger problem for this president, people in this country don\u2019t think that this president is real anymore. He\u2019s not genuine anymore,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for news overnight that Newt Gingrich has surged to the front of the GOP pack in Iowa and made a huge leap forward in New Hampshire, Team Obama signaled they still aren\u2019t ready to expand their offensive to include the former House speaker.\n\n\u201cI think Newt Gingrich is \u2026 somebody who has been a party favorite of the Republican Party going back to the mid-\u201990s,\u201d said Gibbs, who called the Gingrich candidacy and rise to the top \u201cvery much for real.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a man with expansive thoughts and ideas that he expresses widely, and we\u2019ll see how that plays,\u201d Axelrod said, declining to go further.\n\nRomney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul called the near-exclusive focus on the former Massachusetts governor an indication of how formidable a challenger Obama thinks he will be.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has presided over an unprecedented 34 straight months of 8 percent or higher unemployment, so it\u2019s no wonder his campaign is desperate to distract from his failed economic record,\u201d Saul said in an email. \u201cIt is clear the White House does not want to face Mitt Romney and be forced to defend three years of high unemployment and runaway spending. Rather than focusing on job creation and helping the middle class, President Obama and his campaign are focused on attacking Mitt Romney.\u201d",

A number of popular articles recently have paid homage to the need to retain top talent. Recruiting expert John Sullivan says you should \u201cbegin planning for this next round of talent wars, because once the intense competition begins, there simply won\u2019t be time to catch up.\u201d\n\nErika Andersen warns that \u201cTop talent leave an organization when they\u2019re badly managed and the organization is confusing and uninspiring.\u201d So sort yourselves out. Seriously though we need to look at why it is good when top talent becomes footloose. Growth depends on dysfunctional companies and frustrated execs.\n\nSteven Klepper at Carnegie Mellon has spent his life studying how dysfunctional management spurs growth indirectly, and in the same context why it is that big firms fail and why spin-offs function so much better than their parents. Well, that\u2019s not precisely true. He has spent his career looking at how firms become big, and then dysfunctional, where that spawns a benefit and where it brings sclerosis. How the US lost its TV manufacturing industry and how US tire production lost out globally, for example.\n\nThese industries stand in stark contrast to the silicon industry which America has led since its inception. The secret? According to Klepper it lies in the ability of top talent in California to up sticks when faced with a lazy, confusing or over-esteemed management structure and create their own firms. California is unique in not allowing non-compete employment clauses. And from that has arisen planet earth\u2019s most remarkable innovation ecosystem.\n\nFor big firms to retain top talent they have to be ruthless about innovation \u2013 if they aren\u2019t prepared to back employee\u2019s ideas, they will lose those employees to a start-up, to a competitor or to disinterest.\n\nLet me quote some of what Steven told me a year ago when I interviewed him for Innovation Management:\n\nWhat I\u2019ve tried to argue is there is an involuntary birthing process taking place. Existing companies give birth to new ones in the same industries as employees leave and start their own company. This tends to happen to the best companies that have their best employees leaving to create new companies, which in turn have the best performance.\n\nI\u2019ve argued that these companies, these spin-offs, tend to be exemplary performers in a number of industries. The second generation company tends to overtake the first generation leaders. It\u2019s almost as if you need to have them to overtake the parent.\n\nOften the reason that the employees leave is that the parent is unable to see the value of what they have internally. The new value takes off in new companies founded by talented individuals who get very frustrated when they try to get their ideas working in the parent company.\n\nThis is the essence of how Detroit became the center of autos and how Silicon Valley was founded. They tended to be driven by very high rates of spin-offs.\n\nOne odd thing about Silicon Valley and semi-conductors is initially there were no semi-conductor companies in Silicon Valley. Initially the centres of electronics in the USA were New York, Boston and LA, with the main firms producing transistors in the 1950s in these centers. Not one was in Silicon Valley until William Shockley opened a factory in 1956 \u2013 Shockley was later to win the Nobel Prize, and was with Bell labs in New Jersey. He recruited what turned out to be great talent, eight of whom went on to found Fairchild Semiconductor which was immensely successful until it ran into its own problems. A lot of people left there to found their own companies in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe point is Silicon Valley grew out of dysfunction. Texas Instruments in Dallas was a very well run company and very few people left to form spin-offs and as a result Dallas did not become a Silicon Valley.\n\nAnother lesson is you don\u2019t see clusters because it\u2019s good to have a lot of companies together in one region. Economists argue the security in numbers thesis. That\u2019s not how they emerge. They emerge from very good people leaving firms out of frustration.",

They dropped from $42 billion last November to negative $2 billion at the end of January.\n\nIt\u0092s probably a false alarm, though. The drop is purely technical, a function of how the Fed has chosen to classify the money lent through its new Term Auction Facility.\n\nSome background. All banks are required to hold some reserves in the form of either cash on deposit at the Fed or currency in their vaults. The Fed manages interest rates by increasing or decreasing these reserves. The Fed ordinarily does this through open market operations: It buys, usually temporarily, Treasury bonds and bills from dealers, and the funds get deposited in the dealers\u0092 bank accounts at the Fed. That causes reserves to go up. Banks usually lend out anything in excess of their requirements, putting downward pressure on the federal-funds rate. Banks also obtain reserves by borrowing at the discount window, which often occurs if they fall short of their regulatory requirement.\n\nAccording to economic theory, the Fed can target either the price (interest rate) or the quantity of reserves, but not both. Back when the Fed hated to admit it controlled interest rates, it targeted reserves. Since the amount banks borrowed from the discount window was somewhat beyond their control, they focused on reserves minus discount window borrowings, or \u0093non-borrowed reserves.\u0094 In 1990, the Fed began to explicitly target the federal funds rate in one of its most important and least appreciated moves towards greater transparency. Since discount window loans were usually pretty small, total reserves and non-borrowed reserves were pretty close.\n\nLast December, the Fed concluded that open market operations weren\u0092t providing relief to some quarters of the interbank funding market and introduced the TAF. Like open market operations, the TAF enabled the Fed to lend a predetermined amount of funds to the banking system, with the interest rate at which they were lent determined through an auction process. But like the discount window, the money was lent directly to banks rather than primary dealers, and against a wide range of collateral rather than just Treasurys and agency securities. The TAF didn\u2019t add to the money supply because for each dollar lent through the TAF the Fed was careful to liquidate a dollar of its holdings of Treasury bills and bonds to keep its overall balance sheet unchanged. But because the TAF is essentially discount window credit, the Fed decided to classify it as borrowed reserves.\n\nAs Michael Feroli of J.P. Morgan Chase explains, \u0093Defining TAF funds as borrowed reserves is mostly a legal technicality that has allowed the Fed to be more creative in how they enter liquidity into the banking system. Economically, reserves created by repo operations (non-borrowed reserves) and those created by the TAF (borrowed reserves) are both funds lent by the Fed to the public against collateral.\u0094\n\nAs it happens, in the last week of January TAF credit reached $50 billion. The amount of bank reserves the same week was only $48 billion. So, by definition, nonborrowed reserves, the difference, fell to negative $2 billion.\n\nMr. Feroli says: \u0093The banking system is holding excess reserves \u2014 total reserves less those legally required \u2014 of between $1 to $2 billion,\u0094 roughly the \u0093normal range seen over the last ten years .The banking system certainly has its problems, however the notion that the recent data point to banks have trouble maintaining reserves stems from a superficial reading of the Fed\u2019s statistical reports.\u0094 \u2013Greg Ip",

Many who said they were teenagers found the examples to be \u201coutdated\u201d or \u201cso 1990s,\u201d to say the least.\n\n\"I'm 15 and I don't know a single person that types like that,\" wrote Radarada. \"Maybe instead of researching what the 'experts' say kids my age are doing, maybe you should actually get in touch with someone my age,\" she suggested. Macknowzzz, a 16 year-old, says \"I text with all sorts of abbreviations.\" He says each generation provides its own modernization to language.\n\nSome parents also spoke up, including an anonymous writer who said she had seen these types of texts first-hand from her 19 year-old niece, and that she caught her 15-year old granddaughter sexting with another teenager. Other parents pointed out that even though not all teens are participating in unsafe activities, at least trying to become familiar with how they communicate couldn't hurt. Wabbit says it's important that parents be educated \"to the kind of 'speak' that they need to know, to be sure their own children are not getting involved in anything questionable.\"\n\nBquiet commented, \"I think that texting will add some permanent terms to language, and also create terms that will be in use for only a few weeks. Kids have and always will try to hide things from adults.\" Daddyo66 eachoed that sentiment: \" I am a 44 year old parent of two teenagers\u2026ultimately if they want to be cryptic they will find a way to keep us from knowing what they are saying, but you still have to talk to them and keep up.\" He says he tries to keep up with what his son is doing, and would rather have his son be upset with him, than to have him go without guidance.\n\nWhether you found the examples to be eye-opening or way off the mark, the important thing to remember is that communicating with your child is one of the best ways to help prevent a drug and alcohol addiction. Even if they aren't using the exact terms that cited in the article \u2013 many of which came from actual police investigations into drug, alcohol and sexual abuse \u2013 they may be communicating in other ways.\n\nConsider the following responses posted by some teenagers:\n\nGeorgebrooks, wrote \" I AM a teen who uses alcohol and drugs and I have no idea what any of those texts mean at all.\" And Septilidie, a 17-year-old, says, \"I drink and smoke and party, but I'm not gonna text like a complete fool.\" Or even ComeBreakMe who says, \"I can think of hundreds of slang words for drugs that aren't on the website.\"\n\nIf you are worried about your child, perhaps this comment from Ocgirl72 speaks to you. \"If you think you child is doing something inappropriate you as a PARENT should be having the discussion long before it gets to this point.

Ted Kennedy, and granddaughter of Joseph P. Kennedy -- U.S. ambassador to the U.K. from 1938 to 1940.\n\nHowever, she has no experience in public office and has largely been portrayed as yet another political fundraiser being rewarded with an ambassadorship.\n\n\u201cIt thought it was an April Fool\u2019s joke when I first heard about it,\u201d California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told FoxNews.com.\n\n\u201cOur economic and national security are based on good will toward Japan. I have nothing against Caroline Kennedy becoming ambassador to, say, Barbados. But Japan is too important for somebody with no experience.\u201d\n\nKennedy was an early and ardent supporter of President Obama\u2019s successful 2008 campaign and remained a prominent fundraiser and cheerleader through his re-election effort last year. But her subsequent stab at entering politics did not end well.\n\nWith Obama and the rest of the Democratic establishment seemingly behind her, Kennedy made a bid in 2009 to take New York Sen. Hillary Clinton\u2019s seat after she became secretary of State. But Kennedy abruptly withdrew her candidacy, following an inexperienced campaign dinged by public and private attacks by veteran politicians also eyeing the appointment.\n\nShe returned to private life. But her possible return to the spotlight comes at a sensitive time. North Korea's Kim Jong Un has been hurling an escalating series of threats toward South Korea and the U.S. on an almost-daily basis. Japan is a key U.S. ally, and would be an essential partner in the event of any military escalation in the region. Further, diplomacy in the region could be key to heading off such a conflict.\n\nEarlier this week, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney declined to answer questions about a possible Kennedy pick or whether she is qualified to deal with some of the tough issues in the region.\n\nMichael Mazza, a foreign policy analyst at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, said political appointments are now a way of life yet the region is indeed becoming less stable by the day.\n\nHe said the escalating ownership dispute between China and Japan over the uninhabited Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea is perhaps a bigger concern than getting Japan to help ease the situation with North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is struggling in how to handle this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would make sense to have someone with intimate knowledge of the situation and who knows the countries well.\u201d\n\nStill, Mazza agrees Kennedy would carry weight in diplomatic circles.\n\n\u201cForeign leaders could be quite confident she\u2019ll speak for the president,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats on the House Foreign Relations Committee and several liberal-leaning think tanks did not return calls for this report.\n\nBut Mireya Solis, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told The Wall Street Journal, \u201cIt seems to me that when you want an ambassador, two very important assets are proximity to the president\u2014which she clearly has\u2014and visibility.\"\n\nThe American Foreign Service Association, while not directly criticizing Kennedy or Obama, does not support such appointments.\n\nThe union points out that roughly one-third of the president\u2019s first-term appointments have come from such non-diplomatic ranks as politics, fundraising and academia \u2013 a rate slightly higher than the historical average for presidents. And the rate is as high as 85 percent for major European countries and Japan, which are seen as plum diplomatic assignments.\n\n\u201cThe sale of ambassadorships and rewards for political support basically suggests we really don\u2019t value diplomacy,\u201d union President Susan Johnson told FoxNews.com.\n\nJohnson and Rohrabacher, among others, also point out a decline in the long tradition of appointing elder statesmen to the Japan post, citing Japanese-speaking Harvard scholar Edwin Reischauer, who was appointed by Kennedy and was followed by such people as Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, Vice President Walter Mondale, House Speaker Tom Foley and Under Secretary of State Mike Armacost.\n\n\u201cBut this appointment is an ornamental one,\u201d Clyde Prestowitz, a former Reagan staffer, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. \u201cIt tries to evoke the good feeling of the Kennedy years but without the substance of those years. Do you think Caroline might have the good sense to turn it down and urge Obama to imitate her dad with a Reischauer-like appointment?\u201d\n\nCaroline Kennedy, if appointed and confirmed, would succeed John Roos, who was also an Obama campaign fundraiser.",

On Mondays, it's pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu.\n\nI sometimes get little white lumps in my tonsils. What's the best way to get them out?\n\nThanks for your question. It sounds like you're describing tonsillar stones (also called tonsilloliths), which are clumps of food particles, mucus, dead tissue cells and more that can collect in the crypts found on the surface of the tonsils. They may occur when you're perfectly healthy or during respiratory infections or eating certain foods that get caught in the pits of one's tonsils.\n\nIf you leave the tonsil stones alone, they may come out on their own while gargling or coughing. This may be more likely to occur when you first wake up in the morning, after they have dried up a bit and become smaller than the pits where they were lodged.\n\nI consulted with Dr. Mark Brown, an Austin, Texas, physician who is board certified in otolaryngology, facial plastic and reconstructive surgery, and sleep medicine for more information. Brown reports that tonsillar stones are more annoying than worrisome, although they are occasionally associated with sore throats and bad breath. In extreme cases, some people may have their tonsils removed to prevent the stones from recurring.\n\nRemoving the stones through gargling or carefully using a long, thin and clean object may take care of the problem temporarily, but the stones may form again. There are also a number of stone removal \"kits\" available that you may wish to try. Laser treatment to smooth the surface of the tonsils may also be an option you can discuss with your physician if you find the stones to be especially bothersome.\n\nGet a behind-the-scenes look at the latest stories from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen and the CNN Medical Unit producers.

Women have been asked to share \"doek selfies,\" with the ministry's official Twitter account promoting \"inspiration photos\" of glamorous women wearing fancy doeks.\n\nThe campaign has been a social media disaster, its hashtag overrun by criticism and mockery. Although doeks can look fashionable, they are typically kerchiefs worn by black domestic workers. To many they are a sign of subservience, and critics accuse the government of promoting an unequal and submissive view of women. Female members of Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters party have in recent months worn doeks in parliament to symbolise working-class solidarity. Opposition leader Helen Zille, a white woman, was photographed wearing one during elections earlier this year, while stirring a cooking pot on the campaign trial. This went over about as well as the #WearADoek campaign.\n\nThe problem, critics say, is less the doek and more the general triteness of Women's Month, which is centered around Women's Day\u2014a national public holiday every August 9th, and a marketing boon with shops promoting specials for the \"ladies.\" South African women face serious issues that aren't highlighted during women's month, or during the rest of the year\u2014the country's extraordinarily high rate of rape, for one thing.\n\nOthers question the campaign's tenuous connection to the holiday's origins. On August 9th 1956, some 20,000 women of all races marched on the Union Buildings in Pretoria, led by activists including Lillian Ngoyi and Helen Joseph, to protest against the extension of pass laws to black women. Nomboniso Gasa, a commentator on gender issues, wrote on Twitter recently: \"If @ArtsCultureSA knows anything about women's march they should know #wearadoek gimmick is an antithesis of that struggle.\"",

That passage on was published Tuesday by the website Gawker in an excerpt from Isaacson's book.\n\nThe book also includes interviews that took place just weeks before Jobs' death Oct. 5.\n\nFrom Issacson's book, as reported by Gawker:\n\nOn a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony's chairman Akio Morita why everyone in the company's factories wore uniforms. He told Jobs that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day. Over the years, the uniforms developed their own signatures styles, especially at companies such as Sony, and it became a way of bonding workers to the company. \"I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple,\" Jobs recalled.\n\nSony, with its appreciation for style, had gotten the famous designer Issey Miyake to create its uniform. It was a jacket made of rip-stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest. So Jobs called Issey Miyake and asked him to design a vest for Apple, Jobs recalled, \"I came back with some samples and told everyone it would great if we would all wear these vests. Oh man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated the idea.\"\n\nIn the process, however, he became friends with Miyake and would visit him regularly. He also came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style. \"So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.\" Jobs noticed my surprise when he told this story, so he showed them stacked up in the closet. \"That's what I wear,\" he said. \"I have enough to last for the rest of my life.\"\n\nIsaacson's biography on Jobs arrives in stores Oct. 24.\n\nSteve Jobs buried in Alta Mesa among other technologists\n\nSteve Jobs' virtual DNA to be fostered in Apple University\n\nA future without Steve Jobs: What's next for Apple, the tech industry?\n\nPhoto: Flowers, apples and notes paying tribute to Steve Jobs were placed outside of an Apple store in Chicago on Oct. 6, 2011, a day after Jobs died at the age of 56.

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

The pair were photographed getting cozy around the city on Sunday, taking a stroll around their East Village neighborhood with Baldwin's daughter Ireland.\n\nIn a wedding announcement published about the couple on Sunday, they revealed how their whirlwind romance came to be - all thanks to Baldwin's use of one of the cheesiest pickup lines ever recorded on the New York dating scene. \"I must know you, Baldwin said to Thomas as he took her hand back in February 2011, when he saw her at Pure Food & Wine, a raw vegan restaurant on Irving Place. \u201cYou must know me?\u201d she replied, according to an account she gave in Sunday\u2019s New York Times Style Section. \u201cAnd then he gave me his card.\u201d\n\nBut it seems even wedded bliss has yet to work its magic on Baldwin. Despite sharing photographs of his new wedding band on Twitter over the weekend, Baldwin seemed to have thought better of it by Monday, when he suddenly shut down his account. \"It's been fun,\" he wrote on Monday morning, before disabling his Twitter page.\n\nThis isn't the first time the actor has thrown a social media tantrum and walked away from Twitter. In December he shut off his account following an incident on an American Airlines flight, when he was kicked off a plane for refusing to turn off his phone. He defended himself at the time, saying a flight attendant \"reamed\" him out for playing \"Words with Friends\" while the flight was still sitting at the gate. Just one day after his nuptials to Thomas, the still-seething star also snarled at a Daily News reporter who dared to question him as he trudged through Greenwich Village on Sunday.\n\nClad in khaki pants, a black T-shirt and, of course, black sunglasses, an unsmiling and dour-looking Baldwin strolled slowly and miserably through Washington Square Park with his new wife; daughter, Ireland; and two pals. The 54-year-old actor and his 28-year-old bride walked side-by-side a day after dazzling legions of Hollywood and Broadway boldfacers in a storybook wedding at St. Patrick\u2019s Old Cathedral in Little Italy. Hopping into a cab at the corner of W. Houston and Thompson Sts., Baldwin turned to stare down a reporter who had asked him about the nuptials.\n\n\u201cYou can walk away now,\u201d he said sternly. And he repeated for good measure, \u201cYou can walk away.\u201d If Baldwin was in a bad mood \u2014 a portrait of simmering, but ultimately restrained, rage \u2014 his new bride by contrast was calm and unbothered under the 95-degree sun. Dressed fetchingly in a white top, sunglasses and a pair of jean shorts that showed off her toned legs, she did not comment \u2014 but unlike her husband, she didn\u2019t scowl or glower either. She simply pulled out an old-fashioned folding fan and tried to cool herself as she ambled south, past the fashionable boutiques and eateries of Thompson St.\n\nHow bad was the groom\u2019s day after the wedding? When his party of four piled into the yellow cab, Baldwin gallantly offered to take the front seat \u2014 then promptly hit his head on the roof as he got in. Finally seated, he violently slammed the cab door shut and the hack headed east on Houston St. Three hours later, the Baldwins wordlessly \u2014 and separately \u2014 returned to their E. 10th St. home. Bearing several bags, Thomas jumped out of a cab and rushed into the building, while Baldwin and his daughter arrived 10 minutes later on foot. As of Sunday evening, if there was a honeymoon, it appeared to be taking place in Manhattan \u2014 but once again, Baldwin wouldn\u2019t comment. Shortly before the unhappy Village tour, the newlyweds posted photos on Twitter that showed off their silver wedding bands. Yoga instructor and New York University alumni Thomas, who was born on the Spanish island of Majorca, sported a showier band that set off her diamond engagement ring, a hefty sparkler. She indicated she was taking her husband\u2019s name when she entitled the ring picture, \u201cHilaria Baldwin,\u201d as well as changing her official Twitter name to Hilaria Baldwin. mfeeney@ndailnews.com",

Somebody's going to get walloped,\" said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at College of DuPage outside of Chicago, which should be spared. \"It does look like it's going to be a doozy.\"\n\nRich Otto, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, said some major cities will likely see a foot or more of snow. Other meteorologists talked about 18 inches, two feet and more.\n\nOtto said an upper-level disturbance in the air is moving from the Pacific to the Rockies to the southern plains. It should pass over Texas, move into the Ohio Valley, join with other unstable air and become a nor'easter Friday evening over the Mid Atlantic, moving up the coast on Saturday.\n\nAs the storm strengthens and moves northeastward leading into the weekend, it will take advantage of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean, and snowfall rates of one to three inches per hour are possible along its track, AccuWeather reported.\n\n\"Since the storm is arriving on a southern track, impacts will include Kentucky, Cincinnati, West Virginia, Northern Virginia into D.C., then Philadelphia,\" said meteorologist Ryan Maue of the private WeatherBell Analytics.\n\nThe latest AccuWeather forecast map for Friday and Saturday showed the strongest potential for snowstorm activity along the I-81 corridor, from Roanoke, Va. to southern New York State, as well as most of the Boston-Washington metropolis.\n\nThe amount of snow expected in coastal areas will depend on the amount of mixing rainfall, AccuWeather reported.\n\nStrong winds will accompany the storm in the New York area, according to FOX-5 meteorologist Nick Gregory, who also warned of the potential for storm surge in the region.\n\nWhile many in the Washington, D.C., New York and Boston areas can expect to see noticeable snowfall activity, under current projections, little to no snow is likely to fall over upstate New York and northern New England, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Brett Anderson said.\n\n\u201cShould the storm continue northeastward, rather than turn more to the east at the last minute, New York, Boston, Providence and Hartford would be buried in snow,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nForecasters see Saturday as the worst day in the East.\n\nHowever, should the storm system shift 50 to 100 miles farther to the north, the I-95 corridor could be spared the worst of the snowfall, in favor of the northern Appalachian Mountains, AccuWeather reported.\n\nSouth and east of the areas expecting snowfall, a wintry mix is expected throughout much of Tennessee and western North Carolina, shifting to mainly rain approaching the coast.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

His repeated claims that health care legislation will not fund abortion have done little to prevent national headlines like, \u201cAbortion Fight Complicates Debate on Health Care.\u201d Major media outlets from Time magazine to the Associated Press and the non-partisan Factcheck.org (hardly bastions of pro-life praise) report that abortion funding will be included in the president\u2019s health plan before Congress.\n\nEven opposition from his own party is significant. Forty Democrats in the House of Representatives have joined Congressman Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) to challenge the president\u2019s assertion, pledging to oppose health care reform without changes to existing legislative language allowing abortion coverage.\n\nFrom the other side, abortion advocates tee off on the phony compromise amendment sponsored by Rep. Lois Capps (D-NY). According to supporters, the amendment ensures only \u201cprivate funds\u201d will fund abortion on-demand. This is simply not true.\n\nA recent fact-check piece in The New York Times explained why the claims of private money funding abortion are really a farce. The paper reported, \u201cin practice, the public and private money would all go into the same pot, and the source of money for any single procedure is largely a technicality.\u201d\n\nThe reality is, if the president\u2019s plan goes forward, checks will be written to abortionists and to health insurers covering abortions. Those checks will draw funds from one place: the treasury of the United States of America. This expansion of official government support for the abortion industry is a stark departure from current policy restricting abortion funding via the Hyde Amendment.\n\nAny new health care program will not be funded through the traditional Department of Health and Human Services appropriations process. For this reason, the Hyde Amendment, which traditionally restricts federal funds for Medicaid abortions through that process, will not apply to the new program.\n\nOpportunities have arisen to codify Hyde in health care reform legislation. An effort by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) to permanently codify Hyde restrictions in the Senate health care bill were soundly defeated in the Senate Finance Committee last week.\n\nAnd if abortion advocates\u2019 misrepresentations of the bill\u2019s true impact weren\u2019t enough, now many of them are claiming that American women somehow want and deserve government-funded abortion on-demand. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) called Hatch\u2019s efforts to ensure abortion coverage is excluded from health care reform \u201cinsulting\u201d to American women.\n\nYet a nationwide poll released by the Susan B. Anthony List and conducted by Public Opinion Strategies found the president and Congressional leaders lose more than they gain by including abortion coverage in health care reform. Americans are not clamoring for government-funded abortion on demand \u2013 not Democrats, not Independents, and certainly not women.\n\nIn fact, by including government-funded abortion in health care reform, the president turns off five times more voters than he gains. Overall, 58% of Americans say the government does not have an obligation to provide abortion services under a public health plan. Over half of Americans (women included) say it is wrong for the government to pay for abortions.\n\nThis may be surprising to elites but it is not to the rest of America. Americans realize radical feminists in favor of abortion rights have dramatically over-represented a minority position, misstating the centrality and \u2018need\u2019 for abortion on-demand.\n\nPublic opposition to abortion on-demand is rising, as reflected in last week\u2019s polling released by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Record numbers of Americans support commonsense restrictions on abortion. Experts at Pew attributed this increase in part to the abortion-friendly agenda of the Obama administration.\n\nIf Congressional leadership and the president fall on the sword of abortion coverage-- pleasing abortion allies and weaving it into the fabric of our daily lives-- they do so at the peril of the entire bill and their own political futures.\n\nAmerican women deserve health care reform that honors the life of both mother and child, not one that prescribes a government-funded mandate for abortion on-demand and makes American taxpayers complicit in almost every abortion. Without language that explicitly excludes abortion funding from health care reform, Congress will have a compelling reason to reject the president\u2019s health care proposal \u2013 the will of the American people. Votes have consequences, and America is watching.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser is the President of the Susan B. Anthony List, a nationwide organization dedicated to advancing, mobilizing, and representing pro-life women in the political process.",

In January, with other couples circling, they quickly signed a contract for a Saturday in July 2016.\n\n\u201cThe whole situation felt a little crazy, because there were so few dates available,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cWe had to move fast.\u201d\n\nMany couples want a site with indoor and outdoor options, and there are very few high-end spaces in Chicago, with its limited outdoor season, that offer both, said Reva Nathan, a wedding planner who is working with Greenberg and Wolf. All this makes the Adler, which allows couples to hold their wedding ceremonies outside and which offers a sweeping view of Lake Michigan and the skyline, a coveted wedding site.\n\nThere is a growing demand for weddings at notable cultural institutions, quirky urban warehouse spaces or picturesque resorts, farms and vineyards that are easily accessible from major cities. To secure a Saturday at these sites, many of the wedding planners from around the country interviewed for this article said that it was not unusual for couples to have to book up to 18 months to two years ahead, or settle for having their wedding on a Friday or a Sunday, which has become common in the last few years.\n\nPrice, popularity, and exclusivity (some locations accommodate only a few weddings each year) are all factors that can contribute to a wedding site being difficult to obtain. Cortnie Purdy-Fausner, a founder of TheVenueReport.com, a website aimed at connecting event spaces with planners and celebrants, said a couple \u201ccan easily find another planner or another florist, but the venue is the backdrop for everything else. If the couple has a specific vision, they\u2019re likely going to wait.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, according to Shawn Rabideau, a wedding planner, one space that is in demand is the Rainbow Room, which reopened in October. The recently renovated space on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Center is booking private events into 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s got that New York City charm and history, but it\u2019s also modern and sleek,\u201d Rabideau said. \u201cAnd now it has outdoor space, so there\u2019s so much versatility.\u201d\n\nIf money is no object, a wedding at a museum or cultural institution in New York City is a possibility. At the main Fifth Avenue branch of the New York Public Library, the rental fee is $50,000. Memberships are required for receptions at the Frick Collection ($50,000) and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum ($25,000). And that\u2019s just the beginning. Everything from tables, place settings, decorations and ovens must be brought in to turn these spaces into warm, inviting settings for a wedding.\n\nSecuring a wedding date at some of the other coveted resorts, like Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tenn.; the Wauwinet, an inn on Nantucket; Pelican Hill in Newport Beach, Calif.; and the Montage in Laguna Beach, Calif., can be a challenge as couples contend with corporate events and the general clientele. Sometimes an expensive buyout is required.\n\nFor another distinctive setting, some couples turn to private estates \u2014 these sites can usually secure permits for only a few weddings each year \u2014 like the Gull\u2019s Way Estate in Malibu, Calif.; Stone Manor Estate in San Diego; and the Witt Estate in St. Helena, Calif.\n\nGreenberg says she does not mind waiting more than a year and a half to be a summer bride at the site of her choice; her demanding job as a lawyer, for one thing, makes a long engagement a sensible choice.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the first big things we\u2019re doing together,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout a serious time crunch, we can enjoy it more. It has the potential to be really fun.\u201d",

Other Republicans, including many longtime senators, want to seize the moment to join Democrats in overhauling politically sensitive programs such as Social Security and Medicare, the biggest drivers of future spending.\n\nThe confusion was evident Tuesday in congressional budget hearings, where GOP lawmakers grilling White House budget director Jacob J. Lew veered between criticizing Obama as not addressing the looming crisis in entitlement programs and asking what they could do to help.\n\n\"People on this panel here, at least on this side of the aisle, invite the dialogue, encourage it, with the White House on this,\" said Rep. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.), a Marine veteran who sits on the House Budget Committee. \"What might I do, as a freshman member of Congress, to create the political space where the president can step up and take a leadership role in these matters?\"\n\nAt the White House, Obama played down his much-criticized $3.7 trillion spending plan in his first news conference of the year, calling it the initial step in what promises to be a lengthy negotiation over the government's fiscal future. He again invited Republicans to join him in seeking bipartisan solutions for handling the skyrocketing costs of health care and an aging population.\n\n\"The first step in this budget is to make sure that we're stabilizing the current situation,\" the president said of his blueprint, which would reduce record budget deficits over the next decade and stabilize government borrowing. \"The second step is going to be to make sure that we're taking on some of these long-term drivers.\"\n\nFor now, at least, those steps are tangled in a single battle that will affect spending levels this year, next year and beyond. Untangling the process, Obama said, will require both parties to engage in the kind of trust-building that produced legislative successes in December, including an extension of dozens of expiring tax breaks, repeal of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military, and the New START nuclear pact.\n\n\"This is not a matter of 'You go first' or 'I go first,' \" Obama said. \"This is a matter of everybody having a serious conversation about where we want to go and then ultimately getting in that boat at the same time so it doesn't tip over.\"\n\nIn the Senate, where the December deals were forged, Republicans were receptive to that message. But they argued that Obama missed a chance in his budget to send a signal that costly entitlement programs are on the table.\n\n\"Entitlement reform will not be done except on a bipartisan basis with presidential leadership,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters. \"I've been inviting the president to have that conversation since he took office two years ago,\" he added. \"It doesn't have to be in public. We all understand there are some limitations to negotiating significant agreements in public.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a longtime advocate of bipartisan entitlement reform, echoed that view in a Budget Committee hearing.",

Wallace & Wallace Enterprises, a petrochemical company, had the most dramatic growth, jumping from 10th to the No.2 spot with sales of $81.9 million in 1980, up 216 percent from 1979.\n\nBlack-owned auto dealerships, which reached a peak at 37 in 1977, lost two more places on the list this year and dropped to 30. While five new dealerships made the list, seven did not reach the cutoff point of $5.2 million in revenues, and three of those seven closed within the year. Auto dealerships still make up the list's largest single category.\n\nThe combined revenues of the top 100 companies rose 23.3 percent, to $1.5 billion, almost equivalent to the 1980 sales of AMF Inc., listed 225th on the Fortune 500 list.\n\nEarl G. Graves, publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, said the performance of black-owned businesses reflected the ups and downs of the general economy, and added that the main problem minority businesses would face during the next year would be similiar to that of many other companies - access to credit.\n\nMr. Graves said that, in addition, minority-owned enterprises needed Washington's continued support in encouraging the general business community to contract with them. He said he was confident that President Reagan would ''carry the day'' and keep intact the Federal programs intended to foster the development of minority-owned businesses.\n\nMr. Graves said that if Federal assistance, such as the bidding program on some Government contracts held exclusively for minorityowned businesses, did not survive ''it would raise havoc'' with the balance sheets of about 10 percent of the companies listed in the survey. The energy companies, in particular, benefited from the Federal bidding program. Motown at Top of List\n\nMotown Industries, an entertainment company, retained its No.1 spot with $91.7 million in revenues. In addition to Wallace & Wallace, the four other energy-related concerns in the top 10 were the Vanguard Oil and Service Company, with revenues of $50.5 million; Smith Pipe and Supply Inc., with revenues of $48 million; the Grimes Oil Company, with revenues of $40 million, and the Chioke International Corporation, with revenues of $35 million.\n\nDespite the glut of petroleum products that has slowed the sales of the major oil companies, Richard Carroll, operations manager for Grimes Oil, said he expected Grimes's sales to increase in the next year.

M & M Products of Atlanta, a producer of hair care products for the black consumer, led the manufacturing list in terms of growth with a 184 percent jump, to $27 million.

The assets of black-owned commercial banks edged up by 6.6 percent, to $1.26 billion.\n\nMr. Graves said the top 100 companies and the black-owned financial institutions employed an estimated 25,000 blacks, or about three-tenths of 1 percent of the total number of working blacks.\n\nCompanies on the list were based in 20 states and the District of Columbia, with 15 in New York, 11 in Illinois, 11 in California, 10 in Michigan, six in Ohio, five in Georgia and five in Maryland.\n\nIllustrations: table on top 10 black-owned businesses in U.S.",

            "answer": "Energy-related companies dominated the list of the top 100 blackowned businesses in revenues, while car dealerships, usually the largest category on the list, lost ranking as a result of the general slump in the auto industry, according to Black Enterprise magazine's ninth annual survey of the top 100 black businesses.   The survey, published in the June issue and based on revenues, shows five energy companies, with combined annual sales of $255.4 million, placed in the top 10. Wallace & Wallace Enterprises, a petrochemical company, had the most dramatic growth, jumping from 10th to the No.2 spot with sales of $81.9 million in 1980, up 216 percent from 1979.   Black-owned auto dealerships, which reached a peak at 37 in 1977, lost two more places on the list this year and dropped to 30. While five new dealerships made the list, seven did not reach the cutoff point of $5.2 million in revenues, and three of those seven closed within the year. Auto dealerships still make up the list's largest single category."

Although I grew up around the time their music was at the top of the charts, it wasn't really my music. (Back then I bought original cast albums, not 45s.)\n\nThe only song I fully recognized was \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You,\" but the sound of their four-part harmonies and Valli's eerily high voice (all of which are stunningly reproduced here) brought back the feeling of that innocent time wonderfully.\n\nUnlike other jukebox musicals, which use a group's hit songs to tell some other story, \"Jersey Boys\" simply narrates the career of Valli, his friends and the man who wrote their successes, Bob Gaudio.\n\nAlthough a few scenes are dramatized, much of the time the characters speak directly to the audience.\n\nSometimes such a technique can be deadly, but the book, by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, handles everything with such lightness and finesse that you get caught up in their story.\n\nThis is in no small part due to the skill of the cast under Des McAnuff's canny direction.\n\nThe most impressive of the group is Christian Hoff as Tommy DeVito, who started it all. As much a hoodlum as a musician, DeVito could easily be seen as a mere thug, but Hoff has a tough charm that makes him grittily appealing.\n\nSometimes it's hard to make innocence believable, but Daniel Reichard does it superbly as Gaudio. J. Robert Spencer has a touching vulnerability as \u00c2\u00adDeVito's dim brother.\n\nAs Valli, John Lloyd Young re-creates that wonderful sound without ever giving the impression of being just a vocal imitator. He captures the earnestness of a young man experiencing fame in the distant past, when stars were not created every 15 minutes.\n\nThe female roles are secondary, but Jennifer Naimo has a marvelous earthiness as Valli's wife. Erica Piccininni conveys a certain savviness as the reporter he takes as his mistress.\n\nHowell Binkley's lighting sets the drama's quickly, quirkily changing moods superbly. The sets are simple, which adds to the fluidity of the narrative.\n\nFrom time to time we see an elegant silhouette of the industrial skyline of New Jersey.

Is it 12-time NBA All-Star Oscar Robertson or is it Warren Moon, the only player to be enshrined by both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Canadian Football Hall of Fame? Oh, and what about Sadaharu Oh? The Japanese home run king wore 1 as well. Then there are those uniform numbers that lack star quality. Quick, who's the best player to wear No. 69? You'll need some time on that unless you're a Tim Krumrie fan. A number -- be it on a jersey, the side of a car, or a saddlecloth -- often becomes one with the athlete. Or zero with the athlete, as in the case of Agent Zero, Gilbert Arenas, the star guard for the Washington Wizards who chose his number upon attending the University of Arizona because zero was the number of minutes that many observers expected him to play.\n\nWayne Gretzky chose his number for more reverential reasons. As a 17-year-old member of the Sault Ste Marie Greyhounds, he originally wanted No. 9 as a tribute to his idol, Gordie Howe, but the number was owned by another teammate. Gretzky then opted for No. 19 and switched to 14 before finally settling on 99 at the suggestion of the team's general manager. Now the number forever belongs to Gretzky. A team of SI.com's finest numerologists crunched the data on jersey numbers to come up with the best performers (across all sports) at each number from 00 to 99 (Eddie Gaedel was a lock at 1/8). In our three photo galleries of the selections, we also listed our runner-up choice and, in some cases, others who were worthy of consideration for the top spot. No doubt you'll disagree with some of our choices and we look forward to reading your arguments on FanNation.\n\nThe toughest calls? Tom Brady over Terry Bradshaw (No. 12) and John Elway over Mickey Mantle (No. 7). Brady got the nod for winning in a more competitive era with less talent around him. You can flip a coin between Elway and Mantle, but we gave the Broncos star the edge for how he finished his career.\n\nThe easiest choices? Pele (10), Michael Jordan (23), and Lawrence Taylor (56). Numbers that lacked star quality: 65 (Elvin Bethea), 67 (Reggie McKenzie) and 69 (Krumrie).\n\nThe number worn by the most stars? Marcus Allen, Jim Brown, Steve Carlton, Julius Erving, Magic Johnson, Franco Harris, Sandy Koufax, Karl Malone, Shaquille O'Neal and O.J. Simpson all wore 32.\n\nOf course, some famous players never even had a uniform number, including Ty Cobb, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Christy Mathewson and Cy Young. And when Babe Ruth hit home run No. 60 on Sept. 30, 1927, he was wearing, well, nothing on his back. Jersey numbers became common after the Depression, and the Yankees didn't officially decide to wear them until Opening Day 1929. The Babe was our call at No. 3 (just a car length over Dale Earnhardt), but there was plenty of debate along the way.",

His response wasn\u2019t surprising: He\u2019s actually eager to test the market after failing to land a contract extension the past two seasons with the 49ers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about free agency,\u201d Boone said. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019d love to hear an offer from the Niners. At the end of the day, I\u2019ll let things work out the way they are.\u201d\n\nIn the spring, Boone, 28, skipped the offseason workout program before reporting to the mandatory minicamp. In 2014, his contract holdout lasted until just before the regular-season opener and resulted in a reworked deal.\n\nA stipulation of the new deal: The 49ers can\u2019t place the franchise tag on Boone in 2016.\n\nBoone was asked if he was open to returning to the 49ers, who have a 4-9 record entering Sunday\u2019s game against the Bengals at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\n\u201cOf course.

I\u2019ll listen to anything.\u201d\n\nBoone, who was on the crutches in the locker room, is not expected to play in the final three regular-season games because of a sprained MCL he sustained in a 24-10 loss in Cleveland.\n\nBoone walked slowly off the field after linebacker Paul Kruger crashed into the back of his right knee on a 4-yard run by Shaun Draughn. He was initially writhing on the ground and said he feared he sustained a severe knee injury.\n\n\u201cI thought it had blown out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was kind of freaking out.

To date, I have seen the show twice at the Coachlight of Nanuet, once at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford; once at the Coachlight Dinner Theater in East Windsor, Conn., and now at the Darien Dinner Theater in Connecticut.\n\nWhile ''Fiddler'' is concerned with the lives and problems of Jews in a village in Czarist Russia at the turn of the century, the musical's international appeal is based on the show's theme of changing traditions.\n\nThe production on view in Darien does not fit in my memory as one of my favorites, although it has many good things going for it. I especially like the opening of the show. Director Dennis Cole not only put a fiddler on a roof - I have seen fiddlers on stepladders at other dinner theaters - but after Tevye, the dairy man, makes his opening statement of the theme (''Without our traditions, our lives would be as shaky as a fiddler on a roof'') the entire cast, linked hand to hand, comes down the aisles of the theater to the stage. It is an exciting and colorful beginning.\n\nThe story is concerned with Tevye, his wife, Golde, and their five daughters, three of whom are married in the course of the evening. Each marriage breaks with tradition in that the daughters marry for love, rather than accept a husband chosen for them. In two of the cases, Tevye manages to adjust, but when one of the daughters marries outside the religion, it is something he cannot accept.\n\nPerhaps there is no such thing as the perfect musical, but ''Fiddler on the Roof'' comes close. Darien's production works best in terms of its secondary characters. As the three marrying daughters, Tricia Witham, Beverly A. Lambert and Alison Morgan each had moments of distinction, as did Bruce Robinson as the timid tailor Motel, and Cameron Smith as the Russian, Fyedka. Joseph Kolinski was fine as Perchik, the teacher, although a much more gentle radical than the role is usually played. My problems came with the three major roles.\n\nTwo of them lacked a special quality that is almost an intangible. It is that something that Jews call tam and blacks describe as soul, and probably every minority group has a name for it. I did not find it in the work of Jen Jones as Yente the matchmaker or in the Golde of Elizabeth Cole. Miss Jones played her role with conviction, but she could have been a New England busybody. Elizabeth Cole as Golde looked not like a woman who has worked her youth and middle-age away merely to survive but as the late Rosalyn Russell with a bandana tied around her head.\n\nIn the sad but funny number, ''Do You Love Me?'' which examines the relationship between Golde and Tevye, nothing much happened emotionally between Miss Cole and Norman Atkins. They sat side by side and sang and that was it. The idea of love between two people whose marriage had been arranged was not examined. Words were performed.\n\nAnd that brings me to Norman Atkins as Tevye. Mr. Atkins is a large bearded man. His Tevye was likable, but never flamboyant and amazingly lacking in humor. On his first solo number, ''If I Were a Rich Man,'' Mr. Atkins sang with an almost subdued quality, playing down the barnyard sounds and the Yiddish yubba-bubba sounds that are part of the number, and then suddenly opening up his large voice for touches of a sound worthy of grand opera. This Tevye rarely thundered at the Almighty or challenged Him. Rather he seemed to accept with a gentleness that gave the musical a soft core at center.\n\nThe show still works. Mr. Atkins involved the people attending the performance I saw, but I felt he missed something by not discovering the humor so necessary to the survival of Tevye and his family.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of the dances created by Jay Fox, who also played the Fiddler. Especially good was his staging of the dancing in the wedding scene.\n\nI have seen better dinner theater productions of ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' but this one will do nicely. The show is all there, the score is well sung, the staging is well paced. Nevertheless, it is still just a little soft at the center. --------------------------------------------------------------------- ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' book by Joseph Stein, music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick.

In this version of the myth of the perfect couple separated by tragedy, an emotionally wounded but still idealistic pair named Jill and Bill (Lynnette Perry and Pat McRoberts) are the stand-ins for the Lennons.\n\nTheir giddiest love song, \"Yes, I'm Your Angel,\" is in fact the same whimsical echo of \"Makin' Whoopee\" (decorated with tra-la-las) that Ms. Ono first cooed to Lennon on the couple's 1980 album, \"Double Fantasy.\" Moments after the song is finished, Bill is shot to death while taking an evening stroll with his true love.\n\nWhen they first meet, Jill is fleeing an abusive and faithless husband. Bill is a fresh-faced young rock singer and guitarist who is still hurting from a boyhood trauma. In the show's opening scene, young Bill (Sean Dooley) watches helplessly as his mother, who has been stabbed by hoodlums while carrying home groceries, dies at his feet.\n\n\"New York Rock,\" which opened last night at the WPA Theater, belongs to the jerry-built music-theater genre in which a story is pieced together around existing songs. Although some of the material is new, most of the show's catchiest numbers -- including \"Tomorrow May Never Come,\" an updated \"We're All Water\" and \"Goodbye Sadness\" -- are taken from pop albums that date as far back as the early 1970's.\n\nIn trying to sidestep the problem of theater songs' not springing organically from the story, Ms. Ono and the director, Phillip Oesterman, have staged \"New York Rock\" as a crude allegorical revue featuring characters with names like Violence I, Violence II and Ignorance, and lots of action choreography. It is really return to the style of tribal rock musicals like \"Hair.\"\n\nThe scenes of the lovers' blooming relationship are interspersed with numbers in which a corps of sinister street hoodlums swing on poles, brandish guns and knives, and indulge in stylized martial-arts combat. What \"New York Rock\" doesn't have is fully drawn characters or dialogue that could be confused with everyday speech.\n\nThe line between clunking pronouncement and simple, resonant truth has always been very thin in Ms. Ono's (and sometimes even Lennon's) lyrics. And the songs in \"New York Rock\" continually veer between the two. Ms. Ono's best lyrics, as in the gossamer ballad \"Toy Boat,\" have a fanciful dreaminess that invites the listener to fill in personal associations. The more specific she becomes, the clunkier she tends to be. The show's worst song, \"What a Bastard the World Is,\" sinks under an embarrassing hail of epithets like pig and scum.\n\nAlthough \"New York Rock\" is set in the present, the music's elementary folk-pop style and the lyrics' post-flower-child diction and sentiments evoke the early 1970's. Jason Robert Brown's sparkling arrangements, flecked with 1950's rock-and-roll, show off the songs to maximum advantage, and Mr. McRobert, Ms. Perry and Mr. Dooley give strong vocal performances.\n\nThe first act closes with an ensemble number, \"Now or Never,\" in which Ms. Ono voices a Beatles-style utopianism: \"A dream you dream alone is only a dream/But the dream we dream together is reality.\"\n\nThe song distills the childlike quality of a show that is as sweetly idealistic as it is hopelessly naive.

According to a report from the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 40 percent of companies added jobs in the first quarter of 2012, up from 36 percent during the same period last year. What\u2019s more, 35 percent predicted that in the second quarter of 2012 they\u2019ll begin hiring, compared with 33 percent in the second quarter of 2011.\n\nWhile this is certainly a step in the right direction, it\u2019s not going to alleviate job competition any time soon. Which means that job seekers are going to have to be that much more careful about how they position themselves \u2014 and recruiters are going to be even more discerning in their hiring.\n\nMore than 500 companies \u2014 including eBay, QVC, McDonald\u2019s and Citigroup \u2014 use SkillSurvey Inc., a provider of online reference checking solutions, to get feedback on potential candidates. In a nutshell, the technology verifies if the applicant has lied about his or her job experience.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Early in the interview process, candidates are asked to contact a minimum of five references for recommendations. References then receive emails directly from the candidate with a short survey and a signed waiver releasing them and their employers from any liability stemming from their disclosures.\n\nThe survey, which includes some 25 behavior-based questions, takes only about 10-15 minutes to complete online. References rate the candidate\u2019s professionalism, problem solving and adaptability, interpersonal skills, and personal values. Confidential comments can also be added.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to collect feedback from a number of people with different perspectives who\u2019ve observed the candidate on the job over time,\u201d said CEO Ray Bixler. Because of the legal-liability waiver and the fact that the results are aggregated, guaranteeing anonymity, he said, references usually provide very honest insights and candid assessments about an applicant.\n\nSome people tend to fib about their education, their salary and job title, and the dates of past employment. To ensure that the applicant isn\u2019t entering five imaginary people as references, SkillSurvey also captures the IP address from which the applicant has sent his emails.\n\nBixler says it\u2019s important to remember that the areas applicants exaggerate on their resumes might be rated negatively by their references. \u201cSales applicants are always great examples of this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never see on a sales applicant\u2019s resume, \u2018I occasionally missed my quota.\u2019 You will almost always see something like, \u2018I always hit my targets and frequently won sales awards.\u2019 In our surveys, we ask former managers and colleagues if in fact the applicant consistently met their sales targets. If the rating is low, this means \u2018no, not consistently,\u2019 and thus the embellishment on the resume is seen.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Big Brother is watching. And fact-checking.",

The one problem DEC might have is in distribution, because the company has not had much experience selling to offices, the analysts said. The company has concentrated its sales efforts on selling to laboratories, factories and data processing departments, as well as to companies that incorporate DEC computers into other systems.\n\n''DEC has been playing catch-up in office automation,'' said Howard Anderson, president of the Yankee Group, a Boston computer and telecommunications industry consulting firm. DEC's word processor sales have lagged well behind those of I.B.M. and Wang Laboratories, he said.\n\nDEC, with revenues of $3.2 billion in the fiscal year 1981, is the leading manufacturer of minicomputers, which are generally the size of refrigerators and sell for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars. By contrast, personal computers, sometimes called microcomputers, can fit on desk tops and sell for less than $10,000.\n\nDEC's entry into the personal computer market has been considered inevitable and actually comes later than many analysts had anticipated. Both I.B.M. and Xerox entered the market about a year ago, while Apple and Tandy have been in it for about five years. The delay was especially surprising in that the company's strength was achieved in the 1960's in small, less-expensive computers.\n\nBut Andrew C. Knowles 3d, vice president of the company's small systems division, as well as some analysts, said that DEC was not too late. ''There is still 90 percent of the market sitting out there,'' Mr. Knowles said.\n\nThese are the three computers introduced yesterday:\n\n- The Rainbow 100, a computer with two microprocessors. It is capable of executing programs written for eight-bit computers that use the popular internal operating system known as CP/M, as well as programs written for the 16-bit I.B.M. personal computer. (The number of bits of information processed at once is a rough measure of the power of the computer.) The Rainbow has a list price of $3,500, which includes about 64,000 characters of internal memory, a blackand-white display screen, keyboard and two floppy disk storage devices capable of storing 800,000 characters.\n\n- The Decmate II, a reworked version of DEC's word processor. Decmate II sells for $3,800 and includes 96,000 characters of memory, as well as the same screen, keyboard and disk storage as used with the Rainbow.\n\n- The Professional Series, which comprises two models, one selling for $4,000 and the other for $5,000. Both are 16-bit machines with more than 256,000 characters of memory and are capable of doing more than one task at the same time. The more powerful model can accommodate an optional hard disk storage device capable of storing five million characters, and an optional attachment that will automatically place, receive or digitally record telephone calls.\n\nDEC said that 22 independent software companies were modifying 75 programs for use on the Professional Series computers, DEC said. Software offerings for the other two machines are more limited. In addition, the two more expensive computers can run software written for some of DEC's larger computers and all the computers can act as terminals connected to larger DEC computers.\n\nDEC will sell the new computers through its direct sales force to large corporations and through its other existing distributors. The company also said its new computers would be carried by Computerland, a chain of 260 computer retail stores, and by Avnet Inc., the largest domestic electronics distributor.\n\nMr. Anderson and George Elling, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, noted that DEC's sales staff and distributors would favor selling larger DEC computers, because they can earn more money that way. The computerland stores, meanwhile, are already crowded with products from I.B.M., Apple, Xerox and others. ''Some of those guys will push the others off the shelf into the sea,'' Mr. Anderson said.",

            "answer": "The Digital Equipment Corporation, which is generally considered the leading American computer company after the International Business Machines Corporation, entered the personal computer business yesterday with three new products.   The new computers, which will range in price from $3,500 to $5,000 and be available in the fall, are clearly aimed at the office and small-business market, rather than the home market.   Analysts said the DEC computers are technically impressive and aggressively priced. The one problem DEC might have is in distribution, because the company has not had much experience selling to offices, the analysts said. The company has concentrated its sales efforts on selling to laboratories, factories and data processing departments, as well as to companies that incorporate DEC computers into other systems."

But the appearance of her coiffure led FLOTUS admirers and social media users to wonder if she had opted for a drastically shorter style. Her hair also appeared to be much more gray. She could have been going for a pulled-back look, with camera angles and lighting conspiring to obscure her pony tail.\n\nRegardless, Twitter users reacted in near-panic after the program.\n\n\u201cWe need answers @MichelleObama!\u201d one user tweeted at the First Lady.\n\n\u201cWhoa just watched #Jeopardy and saw #FLOTUS looking almost bald,\u201d another commenter said. \u201cShe looked normal on recent trip, but this was bad. Hope she\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\nOthers cautioned that it was much ado about nothing.\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d asked one responder. \u201cHair\u2019s pulled back.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama, who turned 51 in January, has demonstrated a widely admired sartorial sense while championing causes like the \u201cLet\u2019s Move!\u201d anti-obesity campaign during President Obama\u2019s time in office. Her switch to a hair style featuring bangs for her 49th birthday drew praise, and earlier that year she embraced a bob style.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s hard to make speeches with hair in your face,\u201d she told Parade magazine at the time of the switch.\n\nHer \u2018do has taken on significance in international affairs, such as her headscarf-free attendance at the late King Abdullah\u2019s funeral in Saudi Arabia in January. The move caused a furor among some traditional Muslims, but it won plaudits from even one of her husband\u2019s most stringent critics, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nYet many have questioned whether the focus on the First Lady\u2019s dress and appearance is rooted in sexism or racism.

Officials say they should be mailed in, returned to the Elections Department in person, or turned in at any polling place on Election Day.\n\nA Democratic voter says two young men, maybe teenagers, knocked on her door with what appeared to be a bagful of absentee ballots that hadn't been turned in yet and forcefully requested she turn hers over.\n\nThe woman refused, and Chief Deputy Registrar Karen Rhea tells Fox News it is illegal in California for anybody other than a voter to send in an absentee ballot. The case is in the hands of prosecutors now. Officials do not know for whom the canvassers worked, or for which party.\n\nWhile local election officials, the F.B.I., and the U.S. Attorneys will be on the look-out for possible voter fraud, citizens groups are also active.\n\nIn Minnesota, where Democratic Senator Al Franken's controversial 312 vote victory over Republican Norm Coleman in 2008 still echoes with allegations that felons illegally voted, one group is taking voter fraud head on.\n\nElection Integrity Watch has plastered Minneapolis and St. Paul with bus ads and billboards warning about voter fraud and the group is offering $500 rewards for tips that lead to convictions of fraud organizers.\n\nJust this week, local prosecutors charged 47 more people with illegally voting in Minnesota in 2008, and additionally Minnesota Majority President Jeff Davis says they've uncovered 60 more cases of suspected fraud in the current election. Minnesota Majority is one of several groups that have formed the Election Integrity Watch coalition.\n\n\"What worries me the most is that honest citizens are being robbed of their votes. That's my big concern,\" says Davis. \"I mean, election integrity is a cornerstone of our Democratic republic. People have fought and died for our freedom to go out and cast a vote and elect officials to represent us in our government.\"\n\nBut some voters groups warn that poll watching by citizen watchdogs could lead to possible voter suppression. The N.Y.U. Brennan Center for Justice fears some citizens could go too far.\n\n\"We are worried about voter intimidation, people being aggressive, people confronting voters directly, people hovering over them following them around in intimidating ways,\" cautions the Brennan Center's Wendy Weiser. \"That's certainly something that has been a problem in the past and we are worried about that this year. Discrimination is another concern.\"\n\nBut Davis counters that \"we're asking people to be mindful, watchful of what things to look for. Record the details. Immediately report any suspicious activity that they see, but not to directly confront voters.\"\n\n\"Our mission,\" he says, \"is to ensure fair and honest elections. We've concluded that it's up to us, 'we the people,' to ensure the integrity of elections... I think the only people who should feel intimidated by what we're doing are those people intent on committing voter fraud.\"\n\nIf you suspect voter fraud where you live, tell us. Our email address is Voterfraud@Foxnews.com. We have received many e-mails from across the country dealing with absentee ballot issues.

It's full of light. It's busy.\n\nThe building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free.\n\nNow the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre.\n\nIt was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town.\n\nA supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing.\n\nBut that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide.\n\nMr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance.\n\nLeicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped.\n\nAt the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government.\n\nIt's the grant cut which is causing them grief.\n\nWhat's called the \"core funding\" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling.\n\nIf we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be \u00a31,686 by 2019/20.\n\nNottinghamshire is mid-table at \u00a31,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with \u00a31,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at \u00a31,354.\n\n\"The funding system is chaotic,\" says Byron Rhodes.\n\n\"It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,\" he says with a glint in his eye.\n\nCould he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there?\n\n\"If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have \u00a350m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have \u00a3100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money.\"\n\nLeicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about \u00a3300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs.\n\nThink back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only  17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled.\n\nLast month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years.\n\nThe money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got \u00a36.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure.\n\nBut it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a \u00a319m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks.\n\nLabour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run authorities such as Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, got nothing.\n\nThe leader of Derby City Council, Ranjit Banwait, has launched a \"fair funding for Derby\" campaign. He says the allocation of government funding is unfair and political and the cuts they're having to impose on leisure services and culture are devastating.\n\n\"Now they are threatening our ability to protect the vulnerable and our ability to function is under threat,\" said Mr Banwait.\n\nBack in Melton Mowbray, Byron Rhodes has some sympathy for the Labour council in Derby.\n\n\"Derby probably have some greater needs,\" he says.\n\nBut once more he is talking about seizing an opportunity in a crisis.\n\nLeicestershire's finance team are working on a submission to put to the government with good arguments on how to restructure the way funds are allocated.\n\n\"We're going to do it. We're going to work up a system which is fairer.\"\n\nHe has the backing of local MPs and is talking to neighbouring authorities.\n\nAnd with a hand out to Derby, he says: \"If they want to talk to us about how to improve things I'm happy to speak to them.\"\n\nIt's a crucial time to get things right. The government is moving to a system where, by 2020, the grant will go.\n\nCouncils will instead get an allocation of funds from the business rates instead.\n\nHow they come up a formula for doing that in a fair way, which helps those authorities with most need, is the next challenge.",

If so, great, read on.\n\nThese are 10 tips on how be productive even if you\u2019re prone to procrastination. All of us put things off sometimes, so there\u2019s room to become more productive once we know how to deal with this. Why do we put things off? What is really behind procrastination? We\u2019ll look here at some of the reasons for this.\n\nIf you frequently find yourself doing anything other than the thing you are meant to be doing, start by taking a step back. Question why that is, and start to put some strategies in place to deal with procrastination.\n\nIn our hyper-connected world, digital distractions can provide all too perfect an excuse for procrastination. Read a few emails or start that report? Browse social media or prepare a big pitch? It\u2019s tempting to reach in each case for the simple solution and waste yet more time. But the thing we\u2019re really meant to be doing won\u2019t disappear. And putting it off just causes us more stress.\n\nTry these simple tips to combat procrastination and become more productive.\n\nFirstly, notice that you are procrastinating and acknowledge this. Try and do so without judging yourself and without getting stressed about not having enough time. Simply say to yourself (in your head or out loud) a simple phrase such as \u201cprocrastinating\u201d or \u201cmoving on\u201d. Choose a phrase that works for you. In doing so, you\u2019ve acknowledged it \u2013 you\u2019re procrastinating. Now you\u2019ve acknowledged it you can move onto the next step \u2013 doing something about it.\n\nWant to be more productive? Notice where your time actually goes (Photo: GuySie)\n\nLook at where your time goes\n\nWe all use different props to fill our time when we\u2019re procrastinating. Start to identify what these are for you. Do you fill your time meant for other things with browsing social media, for example? Or get lost in the maze of the Internet? Do you clean the kitchen? Or switch on the TV? Digital distractions are a powerful procrastination temptation that we need to consciously resist. It can be all too easy to click on a social media icon when a task is too boring, difficult, or uncomfortable to do. Does this happen for you? Start to note down exactly where your time goes.\n\nMake time your best friend\n\nProcrastinators frequently delude themselves regarding the passage of time. If you often tend to get to the end of the day bewildered as to where the day went then try shifting your relationship to time. Rather than being foxed repeatedly by time, make friends with it instead. Start to become aware of exactly how long each task takes, rather than making a wild guess. To do this, look frequently at a watch or clock, and learn what really takes you 15 minutes, what takes 30 minutes, and what takes an hour. Check in with time regularly, and really notice how each day passes for you.\n\nWhen procrastinators estimate how long a task will take, they tend to estimate without factoring in any time for procrastination. They then procrastinate, and the actual time for the task takes far longer than they estimated (because it\u2019s task time + procrastination time). They then get disappointed or discouraged at best, and miss deadlines or give up at worst, because everything is taking longer than it \u2018should\u2019. If you know you procrastinate, factor that in to your estimation, so you\u2019re not always \u2018behind\u2019 time. While wishful thinking might mean you start off hopefully each day, missing your targets continually is demoralising, so it\u2019s better to make an accurate estimate. As you start to procrastinate less, your estimates will change to include just task time.\n\nWe tend to procrastinate most when the task we\u2019re facing is at either end of the spectrum \u2013 either too easy or too difficult. If it\u2019s too easy, we get quickly bored, have little motivation, and there is little to hold our attention. The trick here is to use frequent mini-rewards to keep going from one small spell of time to the next (such as every 30 minutes). These can be simple things such as food or drinks, or breaking off for a short (five minute) walk or conversation.",

Similar records for last December showed it was the highest for any month in 136 years.\n\nLast year\u2019s number surpassed 2014\u2019s previous temperature mark by 0.29\u00b0F (0.16\u00b0C), the largest margin by which the annual global temperature average has been broken. The warmth was broadly spread across different regions worldwide, NOAA said.\n\nThe worldwide temperature average was also dangerously close to the 1\u00b0C mark above the pre-industrial era, a significant milestone that scientists say would pose \u201csignificant risks\u201d to the ecosystem if the ceiling was breached.\n\nNOAA\u2019s report corresponds with previous data compiled by the World Meteorological Organization, which last November predicted that 2015 would be the hottest year ever, and would cap a span that the agency says was the warmest five-year period. Other national agencies in Japan and Britain are expected to announce similar results over the coming weeks, the New York Times reported.\n\nWhile a significant portion of the increase in last year\u2019s temperatures can be attributed to El Ni\u00f1o\u2014the weather pattern that causes rising sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean\u2014scientists point to global warming effects caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases as a key culprit.

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

The audience at the matinee we attended was ooohing and aaahing with glee.\n\nThere are also some pretty voices and dancers on stage, especially Calvin Perry and Lori Hilson. Likewise, the ensemble (oh, those '50s hairdo's!) is spirited and energetic.\n\nThe general theme, of course, is that the '50s and '60s were extra-special decades for popular music. Nobody is denying this. The trouble here is that there are so many tangents from teens trying to get a date for Prom Night to scenes in the Beauty Shop, the Drive-In and Car Hops that the show loses its focus and the audience loses its direction.\n\nIn the main, \"Shout!\" tries to do too much in too short a time thus reducing many of the era's classics into vignettes.\n\nEverything is delivered with such bombast that you get the feeling you're being confronted by the world's largest boom box. Surely the '50s had ballads that were soft and lilting but even \"Sincerely\" and \"You Send Me\" reverberate off the walls with such intensity that you fear for your fillings.\n\nAnother thing: Were polka dots all they wore back in the '50s and '60s? Or did the production team get a break at the local Kmart?\n\nHaving raised these few objections, you do get the Funky Chicken, the Hand Jive, the Monkey and the Twist for your 15 bucks.\n\nAnd there is amazement to be experienced in the stilt performances of the \"2nd Story Guys\" the hit of the previous production show at the Hilton. They have been held over for \"Shout!\" and that was the wisest move of all.\n\nWhen Michael Russell, Daniel Waskom, Keith Hinson and Edward C. Crump are on stage, the revue soars. The erstwhile four tops sing, tap dance, do splits, twirl, flip, flop and cavort merrily from one routine to another.\n\nThey are simply wonderful, and the fact that they stick around at the end to goof with the audience as it leaves the theater is a big plus.\n\nYou won't leave \"Shout!\" humming the tunes unless you have a bullhorn. But it isn't a terribly bad way to spend an hour away from the tables. If anything, it will make you more appreciative of the volume control on your stereo.",

Did they have a passion for football? \"Were they clean guys off the field? Were they going to be family men first? ...\n\n\"We went through on our board, and I don't know the exact number, but I think there were roughly 40 or 45 guys that ended up with a gold star on them,\" Baalke said. \"They were guys that we had earmarked. We ended up getting a high majority of those guys on our football team.\"\n\nSaid Harbaugh, who didn't know the precise number of gold-star players the team drafted: \"I can tell you this: We, by far, the 49ers, got the most gold helmets of anybody in the draft and it wasn't even close. It was at least double when I was making my random count. That's not to compare other guys and what other teams are looking for. It was just what we kind of were looking for in this draft.\n\nThree years later, that \"gold-star\" draft class has become tarnished.\n\nThe team's first three picks in the 2011 draft - linebacker Aldon Smith, quarterback Colin Kaepernick and cornerback Chris Culliver - have made headlines for the wrong reasons recently.\n\nOn Thursday, Miami police said Kaepernick is part of the investigation of a \"suspicious incident\" at a hotel involving a 25-year-old woman who ended up in a hospital after allegedly drinking shots and smoking marijuana in the company of Kaepernick, 49ers receiver Quinton Patton and Seattle receiver Ricardo Lockette.\n\nOn Friday, Culliver, who embarrassed the franchise by making antigay comments before the 2013 Super Bowl, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges related to a March 28 hit-and-run incident involving a bicyclist and another car. He also faces a felony charge of possessing brass knuckles.\n\nOn Sunday, Smith found legal trouble for the fourth time in 27 months when he was arrested for allegedly making a bomb threat at Los Angeles International Airport. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles district attorney's office said no charges in the incident were likely to have been filed Monday.\n\nIn addition, the fifth pick from that draft class - offensive lineman Daniel Kilgore - was arrested for public intoxication in his hometown of Kingsport, Tenn., in January. A police report didn't mention unruly behavior, but Kilgore and a friend were \"staggering\" and arrested \"for their safety and the welfare of the public.\"\n\nThe slew of unwanted news - three players arrested and another involved in a police investigation - clearly wasn't what the 49ers projected when they hailed their gold-star draft class three years ago.\n\nNow, it should be noted: 1) None of those 10 draft picks arrived with public \"character concerns,\" the tag often given to draft prospects who were arrested or suspended in college; 2) The other six picks have had no known off-the-field incidents; 3) The 49ers presumably have made sincere efforts to identify players who will succeed in the NFL, on and off the field; 4) Kaepernick has not been charged with a crime and Kilgore's arrest, speaking very relatively, is rather benign.\n\nStill, the franchise has lost any perceived moral authority it might have possessed when Harbaugh boasted about getting the \"most gold helmets\" in 2011.\n\nHarbaugh struck a similar note in June when he said he wanted his team to \"be above reproach in everything and do everything by the rules\" when speaking about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the NFL.\n\nThat quote has been widely circulated recently in light of this: Since January 2012, nine 49ers have been arrested or have been the subject of a police investigation.\n\nGiven that figure, the team's draft picks in May will be heavily scrutinized with regard to their past off-the-field behavior. Of course, as the 2011 class illustrates, it's impossible to predict how a player will conduct himself in the NFL.\n\nBut here's one early prediction for this year's draft: The 49ers will have far less to say about their gold-star system.\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The bill was passed by the Republican-led Senate by a vote of 41 to 17.\n\nMrs. Winikow's switch in support of the bill was a blow to civil libertarians who had sought throughout the weeks preceding the vote to convince the Democrat-Liberal from Spring Valley to maintain her position against capital punishment. It also suprised many of Mrs. Winikow's colleagues who have tried unsuccessfully for years to win her support for the death-penalty measure.\n\nThe dramatic departure from her previous stand immediately prompted speculation that Mrs. Winikow - whose new district will include more of conservative Orange County - had yielded to political pressures.\n\nMrs. Winikow's name has also been mentioned as a potential candidate for Lieutenant Governor on a ticket with Mario Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo is the only one of the major gubernatorial contenders - who include Democratic Mayor Edward Koch, and Lewis Lehrmann and Paul J. Curran, Republicans - who is opposed to capital punishment.\n\nWhen questionned about her motivations, Mrs. Winikow denied that politics had anything to do with her decision. What had prompted the sudden change, she said, was an incident that she called ''the massacre that engulfed a commmunity.'' The reference was to the robbery in Rockland County last October of a Brink's armored car in which two police officers and a security guard were killed.\n\n''I don't really believe that those killings would have been prevented if we had had a death penaty,'' she said when she rose to state her case before the Senate. ''But maybe somewhere, sometime, one innocent victim will be saved.''\n\nAt the same time, Mrs. Winikow reiterated her conviction that capital punishment was an immoral act and not a practical deterrant to crime. However, she chastised her colleagues in the Legislature for failing to enact tougher measures to combat violent crime.\n\n''All we do is talk,'' she said moments after the bill had passed. ''We haven't taken action to reform our judicial system in 10 years. I could not let the massacre that took place in my community go by without trying to do something about it.''\n\nMrs. Winikow, an imposing woman whose usually raspy voice had succumbed to laryngytis last Monday, has long been associated with liberal causes. She said the decision was one of the most difficult she has had to make during her years as a Legislator.\n\n''You don't take 10 years of philosophy and change it without serious thought,'' Mrs. Winikow said. ''It's easy to stand on old decisions.''\n\nBut a sudden and dramatic change of events may bring the bill before the Senate for another vote. Last Wednesday, the Assembly sponsor of the bill postponed a vote on the measure to consider an amendment that would allow juries to impose a sentence of life without parole as an alternative to the death penalty.\n\nIf such an amendment is agreed upon by the sponsors of the bill, the amended version of the bill would be sent back to the Senate for a vote.\n\nThe bill as approved by the Senate would establish the death penalty for anyone who murdered an on-duty police officer or prison guard or who committed murder while engaged in another violent felony such as rape. However, the death penalty could be imposed only by a second jury - different from the one that convicted a defendant of murder.\n\nGovernor Carey has vetoed the death-penalty legislation in each of the last five years and is virtually certain to do so again this year. Although the 41 affirmative votes in the Senate represented more than the two-thirds necessary to override the Governor's veto, top Assembly officials say the bill's supporters do not have a twothirds majority in their house. Thus the proposal is likely to fail again.\n\nMrs. Winikow, who expressed confidence that she could be re-elected on her record, said she has actively supported other proposals to toughen sentences for violent offenders, such as life without parole. She also voiced support for a constitutional amendment to require the death penalty in certain cases of murder.\n\nThe amendment would require the approval of two successively elected Legislatures and approval by a majority of voters in a referendum.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Linda Winikow",

The bill was passed by the Republican-led Senate by a vote of 41 to 17.   Mrs. Winikow's switch in support of the bill was a blow to civil libertarians who had sought throughout the weeks preceding the vote to convince the Democrat-Liberal from Spring Valley to maintain her position against capital punishment. It also suprised many of Mrs.  Winikow's colleagues who have tried unsuccessfully for years to win her support for the death-penalty measure."

But last June the administration committee changed the rules for the regional theater Tony to widen the pool of candidates and give Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway companies a shot at the recognition, which can help with fund-raising and publicity. (The regional theater Tony was given last year to Huntington Theater Company in Boston.) Non-Broadway productions remain ineligible for Tonys; only productions that run in Broadway\u2019s 40 theaters are eligible for competitive Tony Awards.\n\nSignature has been producing eight to 10 shows a year lately at its new home, the Pershing Square Signature Center, which has three stages and is located a few blocks west of the Broadway theater district in Manhattan. Founded in 1991 by its artistic director, James Houghton, Signature is best known for focusing on the works of a single playwright each season and keeping ticket prices relatively low \u2014 $25 for all seats during the initial runs of shows \u2014 with financial support from corporations and others.

Not surprisingly, the bulk of the increase is due to a 26 percent rise in Government borrowing, to an estimated $165 billion. An increase of that size should effectively stunt growth elsewhere.\n\nBecause of high interest rates, mortgage and consumer credit demand is expected to be flat this year and state and local government offerings to contract.\n\nA sluggish economy should restrain corporate needs to finance inventory and plant and equipment expenditures, Morgan's analysts say. But the need for long-term financing is so acute that corporate bond offerings are expected to rise more than 50 percent, to $35 billion. Short-term demand is expected to be sharply cut from record 1981 levels, but Morgan's economists say companies are likely to seek another $80 billion of short-term money this year. Production Rise Soon?\n\nThe recently announced improvement in unemployment is not likely to be reflected in the January report on industrial production, due to be released this week. Total hours worked dropped sharply last month, reflecting substantial declines in manufacturing and construction. As a result, economists say output in January could have fallen more than 2 percent. And, with inventories still being liquidated, the outlook for the next two months is similarly gloomy. David Cross, an economist at Chase Econometrics, says output is likely to drop more than 8 percent at an annual rate during the first quarter. Once inventories have been depleted, a rebound of sorts should begin, Mr. Cross says, led by consumer goods manufacturers and suppliers to the defense industry. But with investment likely to remain weak in the second quarter, production in such industries as machine tools and electrical equipment should stay depressed. Mr. Cross expects the July tax cut to help revive flagging demand and raise production in the second half of 1982. However, unless interest rates fall over the next two quarters, any improvement in the economy, and production, could be still-born, he says. Troubles in Trade\n\nAttempts to prevent construction of the Soviet gas pipeline and threats to deny high-technology licenses to foreign suppliers who trade with Moscow may disrupt ra ther than unify an already-shaky alliance, Har ald B. Malmgren, an independent trade consult ant, says.\n\nEuropean officials are miffed that the Administration is asking for sacrifices when trade disputes have limited their access to the United States. Mr. Malmgren says European companies with close ties to the United States are pressing their governments for help in developing technologies, and are discussing joint technology development projects with the Russians. Unless the Administration shifts focus from the pipeline, or decides to make a politically painful sacrifice, like curtailing grain sales, trans-Atlantic tensions could intensify, Mr. Malmgren says. A Campus Crisis Brewing\n\nThe Administration's tax and budget cuts have sought to spur the nation's technological base and its stock of physical capital. But experts say plans to cut Federal education programs by $3 billion in the next fiscal year may do more to harm future productivity than corporate tax breaks and higher R.&D. spending do to promote it.\n\nThe proposed cuts are raising concern about academia's ability to supply the human capital necessary to spur output in the late 1980's and beyond, but there could be more immediate effects.\n\nPrivate colleges and universities would bear the initial brunt of the proposed cuts: Six out of every 10 students attending those institutions receive some form of Federal aid. The cuts are likely to force poorer students, who receive more than 60 percent of the aid, to drop out or attend subsidized state-run schools. Aside from the revenues lost from a possible reduction in enrollment - students have an estimated economic impact of $10.3 billion in New York State this year, according to the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities - an influx into state-financed institutions could raise state and local taxes nationwide by at least $2 billion, says Henry Paley, president of the commission.

No stockings or shoes bear her label yet, but give her time. This fall is only her second season designing accessories.\n\nNina McLemore, president of Kayser-Roth Accessories, said: ''We decided to start with the accessories that ape the most important right now. We expect to add other categories - such as hosiery and jewelry - as we go along.''\n\n''This all reflects the impact the working woman has had on fashion,'' she said. ''What she needs is what we're trying to supply.'' That, of course, is the whole object of Miss Claiborne's ready-to-wear, which now does a volume of $90 million a year. ''When we started this business five years ago,'' Miss Claiborne said recently, ''it was because I wanted to dress the working woman of today. I don't believe in the gray flannel suit. I think she can wear sportswear and be appropriately dressed for the office, for her weekend life and for going out in the evening.'' ''I also believe in making clothes affordable to working women,'' she said. For example, in the photograph at left the harness leather bag is $83; the belt, $18; plaid wool muffler, $21; hat, $18, and wool mittens, $12. They will be at Bloomingdale's in July.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of a model",

All flights to Malta International Airport were immediately diverted and emergency teams including negotiators were sent to the airport tarmac.\n\nMalta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, announced that the hijacking of the Libyan plane was over in a tweet at 3:44 p.m. local time.\n\nThey have \u201csurrendered,\u201d been \u201csearched and taken in custody,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe hijackers, after negotiations, allowed the plane\u2019s doors to open at 1:44 p.m. and a staircase was moved over to let freed passengers begin disembarking in groups.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Muscat said 65 people were allowed to leave, then another 44, including some crew, then the hijackers and the final crew members. All were seen leaving the aircraft without hand luggage.\n\nThe company said on its Facebook page that 118 people, including 7 crew members, were on board the hijacked plane.\n\nAli Milad, the pilot, told Libya Channel TV network that initially the hijackers had asked him to head to Rome. He identified the two hijackers as Moussa Shaha and Ahmed Ali, Libyans who other officials said were in their twenties.\n\nThe pilot said the men were seeking political asylum in Europe and wanted to set up a political party called \u201cthe New Fateh.\u201d Fateh is a reference to former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who led Fateh revolution after his coup in 1969.\n\nAfter many of the hostages left the plane Friday afternoon, someone, apparently a hijacker, waved the old green Libyan flag from the plane\u2019s doorway.\n\nLibya, a sprawling oil-rich North African country, has been split between rival parliaments and governments, each backed by a loose array of militias and tribes, Gadhafi was ousted and killed in 2011.\n\nWestern nations view the newly-formed U.N.-brokered government as the best hope for uniting the country, but Libya\u2019s parliament, which meets in the country\u2019s far east, has refused to accept it. Amid chaos, the Islamic State and al-Qaida affiliates have gained a foothold over the past years.\n\nEarlier this month, militias answering to the UN-brokered government seized the Islamic State group\u2019s last stronghold in the Libyan city of Sirte.",

Read on.\n\nProfile: Boris Johnson\n\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\n\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\n\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\n\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\n\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\n\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\n\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\n\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\n\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\n\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\n\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\n\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\n\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\n\nNo, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on.\n\nWhen Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\"\n\nNo, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump. Same hair though.\n\nNo, that's Julian Assange.",

That is one of the six areas where the two-year-old Thomson Organization subsidiary is determined to become a major force and is spending $100 million a year for five years to insure it.\n\nThe money is coming in from the Canadian corporation's North Sea oil operations. The other areas of interest, all carefully selected during the first six months of I.T.B.P.'s existence, are health care, productivity, energy, shipping and export, and food (agriculture). And now the company owns at least 20 leading business magazines, along with related newsletters and directories.\n\nIt's what Thomson calls ''surrounding the market,'' said Richard H. Groves, 53-year-old president, who was executive vice president of the Chilton Company, acquired by the American Broadcasting Companies.\n\nOf course one cannot surround any market unless the publication itself is a leader. And that is why Thomson will only buy the top magazine in a field -or a close contender - or start a new magazine.\n\nI.T.B.P. seeks to get a ''core'' publication and then build around it. It did that with the Medical Economics group, which got the company firmly into the health care field. To build up the group, Thomson acquired the first and third publications in veterinary medicine, and is beginning Geriatrics Today, one of six new magazines on the boards.\n\n''The future is going to belong to the large,'' Mr Groves said on a visit here from his Radnor, Pa., base. That means large publishers will concentrate on large manufacturers. This concentration of ''buying influences,'' as Mr. Groves and his peers call persons who make decisions on purchases, can lead to lower production costs - because circulation can be trimmed - but higher advertising rates (in cost per thousand) as the selectivity of the audience reached is improved.\n\nMr. Groves explained that when these influences could easily and surely be segregated, as with veterinarians, they could usually be lined up as paid subscribers. However, if the item to be sold is something like a machine tool, the advertiser will have to reach a number of buying influences in a giant corporation. To reach all of them requires a controlled circulation - free - magazine.\n\nEither way, Thomson expects a minimum of 20 percent return on sales and 15 percent on investment, which, according to Mr. Groves, is ''much higher than consumer publishing.''\n\nMany of companies acquired by Thomson are run by entrepreneurs. However, Mr. Groves said, they often are willing to give up their cherished independence to get the funding so that their creations can grow all the faster.\n\nFrequently, he said, these entrepreneurs need help in planning as much as they need financial aid. And the ability to construct a proper five-year plan is something in which Thomson prides itself. It's a nice talent.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Richard H. Groves",

Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.\n\n\"I think the middle class would be better served by Hillary,\" Reid said.\n\n\"I think that my work with her over the years has been something that I have looked upon with awe. She was the first lady. She started the trend toward looking to do something about health care. She understood the issue well, she was the front on the health care during that administration,\" he said.\n\nReid added, \"I also think she's the woman to be the first president of the United states that's a female.\"\n\nReid's endorsement makes him the highest-ranking Democrat to get behind Clinton, who won last Saturday's Nevada caucuses and is the heavy favorite heading into the next primary in South Carolina. And his comments marked a shift in tone for the Nevada Democrat, who in a CNN interview earlier this month was critical of Clinton's campaign in his state and suggesting that the race could continue until the Democratic convention in July.\n\nOn Wednesday, Reid wouldn't repeat that prediction, but admitted it could continue for a while.\n\n\"I don't know about that, you know I had some meetings today and I think the race is moving along very quickly so we'll have to see, we'll have to see what happens next month,\" He said.\n\nReid also declined to call on Sanders to drop out if he doesn't do well in the upcoming Super Tuesday contests on March 1st, saying Sanders' advisers need to decide the senator's strategy.\n\nSanders and Reid have had a close relationship over the years. Despite being an independent with tenuous ties to the Democratic Party, Reid agreed to throw the party's weight behind Sanders when he won his first Senate race in 2006. And it was Sanders' decision to caucus with Democrats that helped give Reid the title of \"majority leader\" for the first time in 2007.\n\nReid called Sanders Tuesday to deliver the news personally.\n\n\"It was a really wonderful call,\" Reid said, adding that Sanders was \"so magnanimous, so kind and courteous.\"\n\nReid also said it was a \"call of friendship.\"\n\nDespite serving in the Senate Democratic caucus since 2007, Sanders has yet to win any support from his colleagues; Clinton, meanwhile, has at least 40 Democratic senators who have publicly expressed their backing.\n\nInitially, Senate Democrats largely wrote off Sanders' candidacy. But as Sanders has gained steam, largely on the support of younger and more liberal voters, Senate Democrats have stepped up their attacks, saying Sanders is not ready to be commander in chief, criticizing his democratic socialist views and contending that his domestic agenda has little chance of ever becoming law.\n\nReid would not criticize Sanders.\n\nAcross the Capitol, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has not offered her endorsement, but she is widely expected to eventually back Clinton. Reid sought to maintain his neutrality through his home state's nominating contest, given the prominent role it has played in the overall process.\n\nWhile Reid helped bring out union and casino workers to the Nevada caucuses that ultimately helped Clinton, he denied that he was tilting the scales in her favor.",

Kubiak knew what the Broncos were getting: He was Daniels\u2019 head coach with the Texans (2006-13) and his offensive coordinator with the Ravens (2014).\n\nIn 2015, Daniels turned out to be a big reason Kubiak is going to his first Super Bowl as a head coach. Daniels scored Denver\u2019s only touchdowns \u2014 on receptions of 21 and 12 yards \u2014 in its 20-18 win over the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAs a coach, when you bounce places and guys\u2019 names come up, sometimes you\u2019ve got to be careful, but there are certain guys you have no doubt standing up for saying, \u2018Put him on your team,\u2019\u201d Kubiak said to Denver reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys. He went with me to Baltimore and played extremely well, played really big in the playoffs for us last year, and he comes here. He\u2019s a pro, he works at it, it\u2019s important to him and I knew he\u2019d fit in. Proud of him.\u201d\n\nDaniels, who scored a touchdown in a divisional-playoff loss against New England last year, is a two-time Pro Bowler who ranks fifth among active tight ends in receptions (479). In 2015, he had 46 catches for 517 yards and three touchdowns in the regular season, which was preceded by offseason tutoring.\n\nGiven his deep ties to Kubiak, he served as an unofficial coach as the Broncos learned the new offensive system.\n\n\u201cIt kind of happened naturally just because I\u2019ve been with his offense,\u201d Daniels told reporters. \u201cFrom a player\u2019s side, hearing from coaches is one thing, but little nuance things, little details. Guys were asking me all type of stuff during OTAs. I expected to be that guy and was happy to help out, obviously.\u201d\n\nDaniels and Kubiak had just three playoff wins and never advanced beyond the divisional round in their first nine seasons together. Their partnership began in 2006 with the Texans, who hadn\u2019t had a winning record in their first four seasons of existence.\n\nAs Houston endured four straight non-playoff seasons from 2007-10, Daniels, a fourth-round pick, earned his first Pro Bowl and had two 60-catch seasons.\n\nAs a young player, he acknowledged he was focused on getting established. He\u2019s now focused on getting a ring.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I was an up-and-coming player trying to get some respect around the league, and I was getting a lot of looks,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThat was important enough. At this point, I honestly don\u2019t care if I catch a ball in this next game.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos have a next game because Daniels accounted for their only touchdowns in their last game. When it was over, he found the man who has been with him, every catch of the way.\n\n\u201cI was looking for Kub after the game,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find him until he was on the stage. We had a little moment. I know it means a ton to him to be in this situation. It means a lot to me to share that with him.\u201d\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

In 2015, Daniels turned out to be a big reason Kubiak is going to his first Super Bowl as a head coach.  Daniels scored Denver\u2019s only touchdowns \u2014 on receptions of 21 and 12 yards \u2014 in its 20-18 win over the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.  \u201cAs a coach, when you bounce places and guys\u2019 names come up, sometimes you\u2019ve got to be careful, but there are certain guys you have no doubt standing up for saying, \u2018Put him on your team,\u2019\u201d Kubiak said to Denver reporters.  Daniels, who scored a touchdown in a divisional-playoff loss against New England last year, is a two-time Pro Bowler who ranks fifth among active tight ends in receptions (479).  In 2015, he had 46 catches for 517 yards and three touchdowns in the regular season, which was preceded by offseason tutoring.  Given his deep ties to Kubiak, he served as an unofficial coach as the Broncos learned the new offensive system.  Daniels and Kubiak had just three playoff wins and never advanced beyond the divisional round in their first nine seasons together."

I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\"\n\nThe court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time.\n\nProsecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof.\n\n\"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\"\n\nMr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year.\n\nHe said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan.\n\nThe court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return.\n\nHe also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping.\n\nHe was prescribed medication for stress.\n\nDefence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine.\n\n\"This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.\n\n\"He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.\"\n\nJudge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",

San Francisco left tackle Joe Staley retaliated against Matthews and also drew a flag.\n\nAfter the offsetting penalties, the 49ers were allowed to replay third down, but the down should have counted because the penalties occurred after the play was over.\n\nInstead of facing 4th-and-2 at Green Bay's 6-yard line, Kaepernick got another chance. On 3rd-and-6, he threw a 10-yard touchdown to Anquan Boldin to give the 49ers a 14-7 lead.\n\nReferee Bill Leavy acknowledged the error after the game.\n\n\"I'm glad they missed that one,\" fullback Bruce Miller said. \"They missed some other things, but we're not going back to that. What's done is done.\"\n\nDavis delivers: After former 49ers wide receiver and current Fox Sports 1 analyst Randy Moss questioned the chemistry between Kaepernick and tight end Vernon Davis last week, the tandem was very much on the same page.\n\nDavis had six catches for 98 yards and scored two touchdowns, which is more production than he managed during a month-and-a-half span in 2012. In the final six regular-season games last year, Davis had just six catches for 61 yards and didn't score a touchdown. He awakened in three playoff games (12 catches, 254 yards), and Sunday provided more of the same.\n\n\"Like I tell everyone, we had all that time during the offseason to build chemistry and just get to know each other,\" Davis said. \"When you've got a quarterback, the receiver's job is to develop that relationship.\"\n\nDavis has had at least one touchdown in each of his five regular-season games against Green Bay. His six touchdowns against the Packers are the most by a tight end in NFL history, according to Stats Inc.\n\nIssue to tackle: The 49ers' first-half defensive performance was marked by a slew of missed tackles.\n\nSafety Eric Reid and cornerbacks Nnamdi Asomugha and Perrish Cox each whiffed badly on Green Bay pass-catchers. Cox's missed tackle allowed tight end Jermichael Finley to score on a 12-yard touchdown catch with 16 seconds left in the second quarter.\n\n\"That's something that we have to correct,\" safety Donte Whitner said. \"And we will correct it. It's very uncharacteristic of us, and we'll get that fixed. We pride ourselves on being solid tacklers.\"\n\nBriefly: Lined up primarily against Packers rookie left tackle David Bakhtiari, outside linebacker Aldon Smith had 1 1/2 sacks and four quarterback hurries. ...

He was Irish and Catholic at a time when it was pretty unpopular to be either. Negative campaign propaganda centered in part on Smith's Catholicism, stoking fears that if he were elected, he'd have the Holy See moved from the Vatican to New York City.\n\nA little over 30 years later, and there was John F. Kennedy, giving a speech from Dallas after feeling increasing pressure to promise the country he would not, as a Catholic President, be beholden to the Pope.\n\nReligion will always be an important presidential election issue because religion will always be deeply important to the American electorate. Yet, we still haven't found a dignified and responsible way to litigate religious issues in the media.\n\nAs much as we congratulate ourselves for the progress we've made in discussing race and gender, we don't deserve any pats on the back for the way we discuss faith. A look back at the 2008 campaign is proof of that, as I detailed in my 2010 book \"Losing Our Religion.\"\n\nAnd now, it looks like any chance we had at redemption this year is gone. As David Brody pointed out Wednesday, Pastor Rick Warren is canceling his Saddleback Civil Forum, which had been planned for this week. The event was to feature both candidates, President Obama and Mitt. Romney, in a 50-minute Q&A with the pastor, focusing on issues of faith and morality.\n\nThe forum was hugely successful for Warren in 2008, when Sen. John McCain and Obama joined him to discuss their views on gay marriage, abortion and other social issues. And it was the success of that event that led Warren to want to do it again:\n\n\"The forum was praised for its unique format and fairness\u2026 Also, the TV networks were eager to cover it again since it garnered one of the largest viewing audiences of that election. I talked with both campaigns about the possibility of doing it again, and they were both favorable to participating.\"\n\nSo why the last-minute cancellation? According to Warren, the campaigns have become too uncivilized to participate in an event meant to showcase...civility. Warren explained in an interview with the OC Register:\n\n\"We created the Civil Forums to promote civility and personal respect between people with major differences. The forums are meant to be a place where people of good-will can seriously disagree on significant issues without being disagreeable or resorting to personal attack and name-calling.\n\n\"But that is not the climate of today's campaign. I've never seen more irresponsible personal attacks, mean-spirited slander, and flat-out dishonest attack ads, and I don't expect that tone to change before the election. It would be hypocritical to pretend civility for one evening only to have the name-calling return the next day.\u201d\n\nThis is a real tragedy. Warren's was one of the few public forums where the candidates would be able to discuss their faith in an open and meaningful way, and without having a secularist press or hostile debate moderators asking gotcha questions about that hopelessly dated and increasingly frightening notion called belief.\n\nAnd how embarrassing for us all. The rhetoric around the presidential election -- from the campaigns to the media covering them -- has devolved to such lows that a man whose life's work is built around compassion and forgiveness can't stomach the idea of potentially adding fuel to the fire.\n\nPut another way, instead of Obama and Romney, Warren's forum will now feature leading voices from the Abrahamic religions -- a Catholic, a Jew and a Muslim. That Warren expects to accomplish more with this roundtable says a lot about the state of this campaign and what little progress we've made since the days of Al Smith.\n\n(photo by Mario Anzuoni, Reuters)",

(Carla Gottgens/Bloomberg)\n\nFor years, gas stations have had an untapped, captive audience.\n\n\u201cConsumers sit there for two to four minutes doing nothing,\u201d said Travis Bouck, Gilbarco Veeder-Root vice president of marketing, on waiting for one\u2019s tank to fill. \u2018We\u2019ve invested a lot of effort to make that two to four minutes more meaningful.\u201d\n\nThis year Gilbarco is testing new pumps that use Qualcomm beacons to deliver highly personalized news, information and advertisements on screens built into gas pumps.\n\nThe screens are a way for stations to lure customers into their convenience stores for additional purchases. An ad for a snack or drink may play. The videos can also promote a gas station\u2019s loyalty program. Local weather forecasts and sports highlights will be shown. Here\u2019s a sample of what Gilbarco is calling Applause TV:\n\nGilbarco is focused on making the most of those two to four minutes. It\u2019s currently doing a test in Minnesota where lottery tickets can be purchased at the pump.\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s all about giving that retailer more interaction with the consumer and creating more engagement points and giving consumers something as well,\u201d Bouck said.\n\nWhile Gilbarco offer pumps that can use near-field communication and QR codes, the greatest potential lies with beacons. They open the door for seamless mobile payments. Plus, the videos a customer is shown while waiting at the pump can be better customized. For this to work customers will need to download the relevant app or apps, turn on Bluetooth on their smartphone and agree to location monitoring.\n\nThese changes to the gas station experience may come faster due to new security standards for credit cards. Outdoor payment terminals will need to be updated by October 2017 to EMV smart chip cards. These cards include a microprocessor for transmitting encrypted data, making them harder to counterfeit than existing credit cards in the United States.\n\nWith pumps already needing updated, it\u2019s a well-timed opening for Gilbarco to sell stations on the merits of installing 10.4-inch screens with beacon technology.\n\n\u201cOur emphasis is really enabling not just this new payment security standard, but adding more return on investment as much as we can,\u201d Bouck said.",

Ford, in China this week as an envoy of President Reagan, said today that after extended talks with Chinese leaders he was ''absolutely convinced'' and ''absolutely confident'' that differences between China and the United States could and would be resolved as relations are ''expanded in depth and breadth.''\n\nChinese Government officials said that Mr. Ford's talks Monday with Deng Xiaoping, China's principal leader, and Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, and Mr. Reagan's meeting at the White House last week with the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Chai Zemin, had gone a long way toward erasing apprehensions that began to accumulate here last fall. This was when Mr. Reagan vowed as a Presidential candidate to upgrade unofficial relations with Taiwan in what seemed to be a flouting of the 1979 Chinese-American normalization accords.\n\nMeanwhile, David S. Tappan Jr., chairman of the National Council for U.S.-China Trade, today forecast ''explosive growth'' in Chinese-American business after Peking completes an economic readjustment program in perhaps three to five years. 'It Is Time to Shift Gears'\n\n''In the last six months there's been a kind of marking-time period on both sides,'' said Mr. Tappan, who is also vice chairman of the Fluor Corporation. ''We think it is time to shift gears and get on with it, and we're encouraged by the response on both sides for that.''\n\nAfter a weeklong series of meetings with Chinese trade officials, the council's board of directors were ''highly optimistic'' about long-term trade prospects, Mr. Tappan said.\n\n''I would say that the outlook long-term is one toward explosive growth in the development of trade between our two countries,'' he added.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Bo Yibo expressed similar optimism yesterday after meeting with directors of the trade council. ''China will grow into a fairly big market in the world in a few years,'' the New China News Agency quoted him as saying. Arms Sales Are Discussed\n\nAt a breakfast meeting with members of the American Club here this morning, Mr. Ford declined to discuss details of his meetings with Chinese officials, but he did say that the key issue of further arms sales to Taiwan did come up and that potential arms sales to Peking were also discussed. He would say only that ''with wisdom and prudence'' Washington and Peking could deal with these issues without upsetting their long-term relationship.\n\nAsked whether a hiatus in Chinese-American relations had been ended in recent days, Mr. Ford said: ''I hope so, if there ever was one. I don't know how serious it was if such a difference did exist. I am always one who dealt in practicality and reality.''\n\nHe added that his observation, ''having come to China on this occasion after meeting with President Reagan,'' was that ''I'm absolutely convinced that whatever differences - if any in a fundamental way - existed, will be resolved.'' Hints of Exchange of Visits\n\nPerhaps to underscore continuing official warmth, the two senior Chinese Foreign Ministry officials responsible for relations with the United States and J. Stapleton Roy, the American Embassy charge d'affaires and chief China specialist here, accompanied Mr. Ford on a two-day riverboat cruise down the Yangtze River this week.\n\nMr. Ford hinted vaguely this morning that an exchange of official visits between Mr. Reagan and Chinese officials might be in the offing. Asked if he had carried an invitation to Chinese officials from Mr. Reagan to come to Washington, Mr. Ford said, ''I did.'' He paused and added, ''Not.'' Then he added:\n\n''Let me put it this way. I don't think that I should reveal any of the communications that I had from President Reagan to the Chinese leadership. I'll say this: I do hope that in the next year or more that we can have an exchange by the Chinese leadership to the United States and by President Reagan to China. I think such an exchange of visits would be highly beneficial.''\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Chai Zemin",

Stein, his party's nominee for Manhattan Borough Pr esident, and came out instead for the Liberal Party candidate, David N. Dinkins, a personal friend and a Harlem political ally.\n\nMr. Dinkins, the City Clerk, lost the Democratic primary last month to Mr. Stein, the incumbent. Herman D. Farrell, the Manhattan leader, said of his endorsement, ''I'm doing it as an individual, not as county leader.'' He made the comment during a luncheon of the New York City Partnership, a business group, at the Sheraton Centre.\n\nMr. Farrell acknowledged that it was difficult to distinguish between his two roles. He said he had communicated his decision to Mr. Dinkins and other party leaders without any formal announcement. Other Instances Recalled\n\nMany party politicians ''have done the same thing at one time or another,'' Mr. Farrell said. Mr. Stein s aid in reply that Mr. Farrell should resign as New York County leader . The leader's job, Mr. Stein said, is to elect Democrats.\n\n''How can he not support an incumbent official who won a primary fair and square?'' Mr. Stein asked. ''It's clear why he's doing it. Because he's black. Well, he's either the black county leader or the Democratic county leader.''\n\nMr. Dinkins is also black, and one of the declared aims of his campaign is to restore racial diversity to the Board of Estimate, which is now all white.\n\nMr. Farrell's decision was rumored last week, but he had declined to discuss it before his re-election as county leader last Thursday. In the primary, the endorsement by Mr. Farrell called early attention to the Dinkins campaign and, on Primary Day, work by Mr. Farrell as district leader presumably helped turn out the Dinkins vote.\n\nFor the general election, there is no precedent to measure the effect of Mr. Farrell's support. In welcoming the endorsement, Mr. Dinkins said it built the credibility of his candidacy, which was originally lightly regarded by many politicians. Koch Desertion Cited\n\nEven in New York City politics, with its multiparty candidacies and dwindling organizational loyalty, no one could recall such an action toward a party nominee by a county leader.\n\nBut there are ample precedents at the lower level of district leader, Mr. Dinkins said. The best-known was the desertion of the Democratic candidate for Mayor on election eve in 1965 by the Greenwich Village leader, Edward I. Koch.\n\nFour years ago, Mr. Dinkins said, a number of party officials supported Robert F. Wagner Jr., then the Liberal candidate and now a Deputy Mayor, after he lost the Democratic primary for Borough President to Mr. Stein.\n\nIn other political activities yesterday, Mr. Koch, the mayoral nominee of both the Democrats and the Republicans, attended a $250-aticket dinner given by Manhattan Republicans in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.\n\nMr. Goodman stressed that the proceeds would be used for the 1981 campaign, not for 1982, when Mr. Koch, a Democrat, has said he expects to support the Democratic candidate.\n\nIn the Manhattan primary for Borough President, most politicians had expected Mr. Stein to win overwhelmingly. But with black districts breaking their recent pattern and voting in heavy percentages, Mr. Dinkins lost by 8,000 votes of 142,000 cast.\n\nRather than running a token campaign on the Liberal line, which he was given without a contest, Mr. Dinkins has promised to campaign hard. Today he will have a $100-a-ticket fund-raising breakfast in the Sheraton Centre.\n\nA number of Democratic officials expressed support for Mr. Stein yesterday, and some criticized Mr. Farrell's action. ''It's regrettable, it's divisive,'' said Steven Sanders, who succeeded to Mr. Stein's East Side Assembly seat when Mr. Stein won the borough presidency. ''Dennie Farrell has a mandate to support the candidate chosen by the people.''\n\nMayor Koch deferred a scheduled formal endorsement of Mr. Stein, but City Hall aides said the delay was only because of the pall cast by the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt. Mr. Stein was endorsed the day before by the City Council President, Carol Bellamy.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Andrew J. Stein photo of David N. Dinkins",

In the summer it's enough to make you wince. But the oily water has its chalky green look all year round, and there are hardly ever any boats. It's Newtown Creek, 2002.\n\nThe city's Department of Transportation has made what seems like a small request concerning this forsaken three-mile-long waterway separating Queens from Brooklyn. It wants to turn the Grand Street swing bridge, one of the dozen that cross the creek, into a fixed structure.\n\nSomething that moves costs much more to maintain than something that doesn't, said Iris Weinshall, the transportation commissioner. And it has been years since a ship required the blue-green bridge, a rickety 1903 structure at the far end of the creek, to swing open.\n\n''If there had been any recent openings, we'd say forget it, but there haven't been any,'' said Gary Kassof, bridge administrator for the First Coast Guard Division, which has jurisdiction over the creek. He was speaking of both the Grand Street bridge and all the deteriorating rail and road bridges across it.\n\nBut the Coast Guard's looming assent to this minor cost-cutting request is full of symbolism.\n\nTo make the Grand Street swing bridge a fixed structure will seal the fate of the waterway, rendering it impossible for ships to pass through. For a waterway that was the busiest industrial port in the Northeast 60 years ago, its waters continuously churned by a long line of boats, it would be an official death knell.\n\nNewtown Creek is woven deeply into the city's history. Until the Dutch arrived, the Maspetches Indians lived along its banks in what is now Maspeth, Queens. Some believe that Captain Kidd used a friend's waterfront property there to stash his plunder. The creek was part of a boundary dispute from the mid-1600's to the mid-1700's between Bushwick and Newtown, the precursors to Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nBut it was through commerce that the waterway came into its prime.\n\nBy the 1850's, the creek was an industrial center that both fueled and paralleled the explosive growth of New York. Glue factories, smelting and fat-rendering plants, one of the earliest kerosene refinery and other smelly enterprises clustered along the shores of the creek and its little tributaries. The toxic sludge from these businesses got company in 1856, when the city decided to dump raw sewage directly into the water, a practice that continued for decades.\n\nIn the 1920's and 30's, the creek was widened to accommodate the growing traffic. In its heyday, the bridges that crossed it opened tens of thousands of times a year.\n\n''Newtown Creek was a highway,'' said Bernard Ente, a local historian. ''It was just boats instead of trucks.'' He estimated that 500 enterprises lined the creek at its peak. Large boats brought in raw materials and fuel and took out oil, fat, varnish, chemicals and metals.\n\nThen came World War II. The government commandeered the factories to make military equipment.\n\nFrancis Principe, 92, a Maspeth resident who supervised a factory that made aluminum for fighter planes, said that during that time, ''There was always tanker traffic.''\n\nBut then the creek began a rapid decline. The national highway system, built after World War II, made trucks a more efficient way to transport goods. Shippers no longer had to be tied to water routes or railways.\n\nNow, buildings along the water stand empty. Instead of ships, plastic bags pass beneath the bridges like half-submerged ghosts. The remaining factories don't use the water.\n\nBut kayakers have been spotted at the creek recently, and Community Board 1 in Brooklyn is considering creating a series of pocket parks along the shore. The blue-claw crabs have come back, too.\n\nMr. Principe sees the writing on the wall. ''If the D.O.T. closes down one bridge,'' he said, ''then others will follow, and the creek's as good as gone.''

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.

It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

(Rest assured, he dances again within a week or so, without incident.)\n\nThere's not much suspense over whether Elgin and David will settle their differences in time for the final showdown, The Big Bounce - coincidentally, the name of another movie opening today.\n\nA subplot involving missing drug money and the usual threats by underworld kingpins is casually and mysteriously dispensed with at the beginning of the third act.\n\n\"It's taken care of,\" says Mr. Rad (Steve Harvey), a kind of hip-hop umpire who judges most of the dance contests.\n\nWriter-director Christopher B. Stokes (\"House Party 4\") comes from the music-video world, and it shows. This could be deemed Short Attention Span Cinema, where scenes end abruptly and subplots are sketchy.\n\nOn the checklist of things a movie should offer, like character development, dialogue with subtext and plausibility, \"You Got Served\" is more like \"You Got Screwed.\"\n\nThere are two exceptions: The wittily flamboyant choreography by Dave Scott and Shane Sparks, and the hard-charging dancing by the cast.\n\nToo bad the dance sequences are filmed and edited erratically, so as to make it nearly impossible to appreciate all the artistry and grunt work that went into them.\n\nThe dancing is always energetic, even when it's not ergonomic.

DANIELS\n\nAs they usually do in June, tenant groups and landlords are once again arguing about the effect of the city and state's rent stabilization laws. But this year there is a difference: next Tuesday New York State's Emergency Tenant Protection Act is due to expire.\n\nThe State Legislature is only now beginning serious negotiations on five proposals to revise the seven-year-old law, which applies to 900,000 rentstabilized apartments in New York City and 75,000 more in Nassau, Rockland and Westchester Counties.\n\nAbout 300,000 other apartments in the city's rent control program and 60,000 more in the state program are not under the jurisdiction of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act.\n\nThe preliminary rounds of the debate were played out in hearings held in the metropolitan area by the Assembly's Standing Committee on Housing.\n\nTenants groups and their allies contended that the law had not protected renters from avaricious landlords and should be amended to offer tenants more protection. Landlord groups and their allies asserted that the law must be changed because it had made it difficult for owners to maintain their properties. Legislature Is Divided\n\nBut working against the kind of broad revision hoped for by both tenant and landlord advocates is a sharp division in the Legislature. While there is strong sentiment in the Democraticcontrolled Assembly for strengthening the bill's protections for tenants, there is opposition to such action in the Republicandominated Senate.\n\nThat division, coupled with the approaching deadline, may result in the Legislature renewing the act largely as is, according to lobbyists for both sides. The Legislature did this in 1977, when the act last came up for renewal.\n\nPeter Beitchman, an aide to Alexander B. Grannis - a Democrat-Liberal of Manhattan who is chairman of the State Assembly's Standing Committee on Housing - said yesterday that he was confident the act would be renewed by the June 30 deadline.\n\nFrank Rinaldi, counsel to the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, said that ''we in the Senate would like to see a return to the free market system,'' but he added that there was not even a slim possibility of that this year.\n\nThe five proposals are by the Rent Stabilization Association, a New York City landlord group that finances the city's rent stabilization system; the Temporary State Commission on Rental Housing, impaneled two years ago to investigate rental housing in the state and since disbanded; Assemblyman John C. Dearie, Democrat of the Bronx and a candidate for City Comptroller, along with another sponsor, State Senator John E. Flynn, Democrat of Yonkers and the Bronx; the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, a tenant lobbying group; and Assemblyman Grannis.\n\nThe proposal of the landlord group incorporates many of the provisions of the present act. But it would limit the act's jurisdiction to New York City alone and would allow landlords to charge market-level rents on vacant apartments, something they cannot now do.\n\nThe four other proposals, in varying degrees, urge greater protection of tenants against rental overcharges and an expansion of the act's jurisdiction. Both Sides Seek Change\n\nThe State Legislature initially voted the act in an effort to protect tenants against excessive rent increases while allowing landlords a fair profit. Since then both tenants and landlords have assailed it.\n\nBehind the jockeying in the State Capitol is the major question affecting millions of apartment renters, a far smaller number of landlords and the quality of housing in some of the state's bigger municipalities: How much rent should tenants pay?\n\nMany issues are involved in the answer. To identify a few: Are the rent increases levied by the Rent Guidelines Board justified by the landlords's economic needs of landlords? How widespread is overcharging for rent-stabilized apartments in New York City, and does it occur in part because the system's enforcement agency has too great a backlog to investigate complaints promptly? Should landlords be allowed to pass along to tenants the higher costs of refinancing mortgages?\n\nIn New York City the rent stabilization law applies to the following: all rental apartment buildings of six units or more; all rental apartments except those covered by rent control; rental apartments in buildings constructed after Jan. 1, 1974 and that have not received tax abatements; and rent-controlled apartments that have been vacated.\n\nIn addition to the basic rent for an apartment, the law governs the sum a landlord can add to the rent for major capital improvements, new equipment, furnishings and fuel costs.\n\nThe nine-member Rent Guidelines Board sets rent levels, and a nine-member Conciliation and Appeals Board adjudicates disputes. The appeals board, by law, gets its funds to operate from the Rent Stabilization Association, to which the owners of rent-stabilized apartments must belong. The association collects about $4 million in dues and contributes about $2.5 million to the appeals board.",

The reason is because Eurodollar interest rates are beyond the control of all central banks, they are the most sensitive in the international money market.\n\nIndeed, the new Eurodollar futures market could eventually be used by monetary authorities as an inexpensive, convenient and highly leveraged method of intervening in support of the dollar and other currencies, according to John M. Blin, senior vice president of the New York Futures Exchange.\n\nMr. Blin, an economist, is regarded as one of the designers of Eurodollar futures, which he helped develop for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's International Monetary Market several years ago. In an interview last Friday, Mr. Blin observed:\n\n''Consider first the sheer magnitude of the Eurodollar market. It is staggering. While the exact amount of dollars floating outside the country is not known, most money market dealers place the total close to $1 trillion.\n\n''Actually,'' he continued, ''much of these 'overseas dollars' exist only on the books of foreign branches of American banks, mostly in London, rather than in the overseas vaults of domestic or other financial institutions.''\n\nWhat is more important, he said, is the fact that the interest rates on Eurodollars have long been considered the most valid barometer of the international cost of money. The London interbank offered rate is the base borrowing cost of these dollars, which are lent to foreign governments as well as to large corporations. Mr. Blin added:\n\n''One major reason is that these Eurodollars are not influenced by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve because they are outside the country. Similarly, the Bank of England exercises no control on these funds because they are not sterling. Unlike ordinary bank deposits here or abroad, Eurodollars are not subject to central bank reserve requirments, which are a factor in determining the prime and all other lending rates.''\n\nMuch of today's international financing involves Eurodollars, which are mainly deposits from the Middle East oil exporting countries, Mr. Blin said. ''The banks that use these dollars for lending have always faced big risks because of the often volatile rate moves. Often, the petrodollars deposited in London are for shorter periods than the maturities on their loans to customers.''\n\nAs for the Eurodollar futures, the lenders can lock in rates just as grain and other commodity dealers can hedge their exposure. ''Also,'' Mr. Blin stressed, ''Government monetary authorities could eventually use this market, in effect, to insure against adverse fluctuations in the value of their currencies through the purchase and sale of Eurodollar futures. Assuming, as many of us believe, the Eurodollar futures market will grow large enough to accommodate such operations.''\n\nTraditionally, a central bank seeking to stabilize the value of its currency would either support it through purchases and sales or enter into various ''swap'' arrangements.\n\nThe Chicago Mercantile's three-month Eurodollar time deposit futures contract carries a face value of $1 million. The minimum price move is $25 per contract. For the first time in any commodity futures market, the underlying goods are not deliverable, although the delivery months are January, March, June, September and December. Instead, all contracts are settled for cash.\n\nNo Eurodollar futures contracts will change hands, just as New York banks operate in the London Eurodollar market without one dollar actually moving between the two cities. When the contract expires, the exchange will, in effect, average the interbank rates of the leading banks in London on that day and that will be the final settlement price for the delivery.\n\nAt last Friday's close, for example, the active March Eurodollar delivery at ''85.80'' was off $150. The 85.80 means a rate of 14.20 percent on an annual basis on the March contract (100 percent face value minus 85.80 equals 14.20 percent).",

(Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nIn light of yesterday\u2019s refusal by the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a case that could have prohibited further government funding of embryonic stem cell research on ethical grounds, a sigh of relief was expressed by many leaders in the field.\n\nDoug Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute , said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier that this frivolous, but at the same time potentially devastating distraction is behind us, and we can once again focus all our attention on advancing all forms of stem cell science, including research using embryonic stem cells \u2013 which are the gold standard against which we measure other types.\u201d\n\nRobert Lanza, chief science officer for Advanced Cell Technology: \u201cWe\u2019re obviously delighted with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision,\u201d he told me in an email. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s a shame it took this long to put this lawsuit to rest, not to mention the potentially life-saving research it held up or slowed in the process.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Cell had a pretty good year from a scientific perspective.\n\nThe California-based company\u2019s clinical trials for the treatment of Stargardt Disease with embryonic stem (ES) cells have proceeded without any safety issues. Plans to derive blood platelets from reprogrammed, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), have also been submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nOpponents of embryonic stem cell research, which involves destroying the donated embryos from which cell lines are derived, have long argued that the discovery of iPS cells in 2006 (for which Shinya Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine this past year) obviates the need for embryonic stem cell research.\n\nBut like Melton and many of his colleagues in research, Lanza said this stance ignores the basic science, and both kinds of research will be crucial to the success of the entire field.\n\niPS cells are not yet ready for prime time. Most researchers agree that one day they will supplant embryonic stem cells in the lab. But currently there remain too many unresolved problems with their generation, and embryonic stem cells are considered a necessary tool in the continued research on how to perfect iPS cells for potential therapeutic use.\n\nAccording to Paul Knoepfler, who runs his own lab at the University of California Davis School of Medicine, iPS cells are \u2018awesome\u2019.\n\n\u201cConsidering their relatively short existence, we know a great deal about human iPS cells in a general sense,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as a field we know surprisingly little about how they will behave specifically in a clinical setting.\n\n\u201cWhy? Because there has been very little pre-clinical data published on human iPS cells. A number of important questions are largely unanswered. For example, how will transplanted human iPS cell derivatives behave in terms of cell fate and safety long-term in clinically relevant transplantation settings in rodents or larger animals that are good models for humans?\u201d\n\nJalees Rehman, of the University of Illinois, Chicago, agreed. \u201cI usually ask the postdocs and PhD students in my lab to always study ES cells and iPS cells side-by-side, whenever possible. ES cells have been around for 10-15 years, the ES cell lines are very well characterized and have been used in numerous in vivo studies and for the purposes of tissue engineering, with minimal potential for teratoma formation.\n\n\u201cWe currently generate our own iPS cells, and the methods that have the highest efficiency of iPS cell generation also happen to use integrating viruses and the oncogene c-myc. ES cells do not come with any integrating viruses and are thus better suited for clinical trials.\u201d\n\nAlthough hope remains high that reprogrammed cells can serve ultimately as an embryo-free source of stem cells, Lanza said, it would be premature to abandon research using embryonic stem cells until scientists fully understand what\u2019s causing their current problems.\n\n\u201cI am sure that in the next years,\u201d said Rehman, \u201cwe might have methods which permit high efficiency of iPS cell formation without using integrating viruses, but during this time, we need to keep on using ES cells as the gold standard of a pluripotent cell.\u201d\n\nThe literature on similarities and differences between ES cells and iPS cells, he said, is quite controversial and scientists still do not know whether differences between different iPS cell lines are just due to genetic differences between the adult cell lines that were used for reprogramming or whether genetic changes occurred during reprogramming.\n\nFollow me on Facebook and Twitter.

So, they\u2019re offering big money to buy back their own stock. This year, big US companies have given the go-ahead for $286 billion of buybacks, up 88 percent from the same period last year, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm. If the pace continues this year, the tally will exceed the record set in 2007.\n\nInvestors like buybacks because they suggest companies think their stock is cheap. They also help reduce the number of shares outstanding, which increases earnings per share. And higher earnings per share often, though not always, lead to rising stock prices.\n\nBut buybacks are also crucial to the rally for a reason that\u2019s not widely known. Companies are one of the few big stock purchasers now. Nearly every other big player in the market has been selling more than they\u2019ve been buying.\n\nHowever much they spend, each dollar of buybacks appears to be having a greater effect on raising the prices of certain stocks. That\u2019s because fewer shares are changing hands.\n\nStocks move up for many reasons, so the exact impact on prices of stocks when companies buy their shares is unclear. In any event, the total amount of buybacks doesn\u2019t appear to be enough to have a big effect on the whole market.\n\nBut some on Wall Street are worried.\n\nGregory Milano, CEO of consultancy Fortuna Advisors, has run studies showing that companies that spend the most on buying back their own stock tend to underperform because they don\u2019t spend enough on opening new factories, research, or otherwise building their business.\n\nAnother problem is that buybacks can give investors a false sense of a company\u2019s true earnings power.\n\nThe dilemma facing buyback skeptics who are thinking of selling is the same one facing those worried the rise in the market has come mostly from the Federal Reserve efforts to stimulate the economy. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t fight the Fed,\u2019\u2019 the old Wall Street saw goes.\n\nTo which should perhaps be added, \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t buck the buybacks.\u2019\u2019",

He charged that Checketts was being spiteful because Riese would not agree to his proposed changes to a Beefsteak Charlie's restaurant in the Seventh Avenue arcade leading into the arena.\n\nSince then, the Beefsteak Charlie's has been taken over by Vornado Realty.

And as the Giants and A's play some holiday baseball.\n\nMotor club AAA estimates that 4.3 million Californians will travel 50 miles or more over the Memorial Day weekend - an increase of 1.8 percent over last year and the second-highest number since 2005.\n\nOf those, roughly 3.5 million will be traveling by car, likely leading to some clogged roadways around the Bay Area.\n\nComplicating matters, Caltrans is closing a section of southbound I-280 in San Francisco between the on-ramp at Sixth and King streets and the Pennsylvania Avenue on-ramp.\n\nThe freeway, which was set to close at 9 p.m. Thursday, won't reopen until 5 a.m. Tuesday, officials said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Giants host the Minnesota Twins at AT&T Park on Friday (7:15 p.m.), Saturday (7:05 p.m.) and Sunday (1:05 p.m.) before hosting the Chicago Cubs on Monday (1:05 p.m).\n\nThe A's return from a road trip Monday to host the Detroit Tigers at 1:05 p.m. at O.co Coliseum.\n\nThe annual Carnaval celebration will also be shaking its way through San Francisco this weekend, with the Grand Parade as Sunday's main event.\n\nThe festive procession kicks off at 9:30 a.m. at the corner of 24th and Bryant streets and will make its way to Mission and 17th streets. Roads will be closed around the event and drivers are encouraged to avoid the area.\n\nWith a warming trend ahead, coupled with high school and college graduations, many Bay Area law enforcement agencies plan to be out in force looking for drunken drivers, setting up checkpoints and saturation patrols.\n\nChoosing to fly rather than drive may provide some relief - but there's a catch.\n\nSan Francisco International Airport recently closed two of its four runways for maintenance, though officials said the closure shouldn't have a huge effect on travelers.\n\nThe airport has been planning for the project since 2008, said spokesman Doug Yakel, working with airlines to reconfigure flight plans to accommodate the lower capacity.\n\nHe added that delays were more likely to be caused by San Francisco's infamous \"summer gloom,\" which often envelops the airport in fog for the morning hours.\n\nFliers are urged to confirm plans with their carriers.\n\n\"Our goal is for customers not to be impacted in any way,\" said Yakel. \"But the potential for delays is there.\"\n\nOn Friday, the peak day for travel through the airport, 125,000 customers are expected to fly, Yakel said.\n\n\"We coordinate with airlines and the TSA to make sure we can handle these kinds of volumes,\" he said. \"We just need to make sure that we have all hands on deck.\"\n\nBut the news out of the airport isn't all about crowds and delays.\n\nIn an effort to soothe the nerves of weary travelers, the airport recently introduced the Wag Brigade, a roving band of therapy dogs in \"pet me\" vests. Members of the seven-dog brigade are scheduled to be on patrol throughout the holiday weekend.\n\nKale Williams is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Tabloids have obsessively covered the reality show couple\u2019s rocky year: In August, the NBA star, 34, was pulled over for suspicion of driving under the influence. Shortly after, he reportedly entered rehab for a day before leaving. Earlier this week, Odom struck a plea deal in the DUI case; Kardashian, 29, officially filed for divorce on Friday. TMZ posted the court papers, which cite irreconcilable differences.\n\nAs reality TV viewers may recall, the couple tied the knot in 2009 after dating for a month, with much skepticism from Kardashian\u2019s family. All the drama was chronicled on their E! reality empire, as well as spin-off \u201cKhloe & Lamar,\u201d which lasted two seasons. Odom \u2013 who has openly talked about his difficult childhood \u2013 was generally seen gamely putting up with his in-laws\u2019 camera-loving antics.\n\nViewers curious for more details won\u2019t have to wait long: a new season of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d starts in January.\n\nMore Reliable Source: Ted Cruz; David Rubenstein; Alex Ovechkin; Gloden Globe snubs; George W.

That much is certain.\n\nBut Wall Street remains cautious if Donahoe, a longtime management consultant, can really rev up eBay\u2019s sales engine.\n\nDuring his first earnings call with analysts Wednesday, Donahoe promised big changes in the next several weeks to help revive eBay\u2019s core business. He discussed his plan to offer fixed-priced goods and an improved customer rating and support system to lure buyers. Next week eBay (EBAY) will lower fees for sellers to list items while taking a bigger cut on sales. \u201cEBay\u2019s best days are ahead,\u201d Donahoe said.\n\nSome analysts aren\u2019t so sure. Despite reporting fourth-quarter revenue that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectation, eBay offered disappointing guidance for the first quarter and for 2008. EBay\u2019s fourth quarter revenues rose 27% from the previous year\u2019s record to $2.18 billion. The San Jose-based company said its outlook for 2008 was between $8.5 to $8.7 billion and just $2.0-$2.05 billion for the first quarter. Shares of eBay fell 5 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nSome suspect that eBay is low-balling estimates to give the new CEO the best odds to look good. \u201cThat was a huge step down, and quite a bit lower than we were expecting,\u201d says Jeffrey Lindsay, a senior analyst with Bernstein. \u201cMaybe eBay didn\u2019t want to set the bar too high for Donahoe, but that could backfire. After what happened with Apple, investors are extremely sensitive with guidance.\u201d\n\nWhitman grew eBay from a small auction site to an online giant with revenues of $7.7 billion in revenue last year. After a decade she decided it was time for a change. \u201cIt\u2019s important that new perspective and new eyes come into this company,\u201d Whitman said on the earnings conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to stay fresh for this long. I felt it was the right time to turn over the reins.\u201d\n\nDonahoe\u2019s methodical style is a drastic turn from Whitman, who was known as a big risk taker. Whitman often led by instinct, resulting in the acquisition of PayPal, which raked in $563 million for the fourth quarter, making up a quarter of eBay\u2019s profits. But that risk-taking also led her to buy Skype in 2005. The company conceded it overpaid for the Internet calling service when it took a $1.4 billion charge in the third quarter of 2007.\n\nDonahoe, who spent 18 years at consulting firm Bain, has a much more systematic approach. Several times during the call, he stressed that he would test new models by collecting data points first and would tweak models if they did not immediately succeed. Whitman hired Donahoe three years ago to run eBay Marketplaces, which makes up 70 percent of the company\u2019s revenues. The division\u2019s revenue for the fourth quarter rose to $1.5 billion, a 21% growth from the previous year\u2019s period.\n\n\u201cHe seems to be addressing many of the key issues, which is a nice change,\u201d says Derek Brown, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. \u201cHe seems to be talking about making more aggressive changes. Whether he will be pulling the right levers at the right time at the right degrees, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the $40 billion question.\u201d",

Combined revenues are up 12% to $1.49 trillion for 2012. Compare this to combined revenues of $1.33 trillion in 2011 and $1.35 trillion in 2010. It will come as no surprise that Cargill and Koch Industries took the number one and number two spots, respectively. TransMontaigne, a Colorado-based oil & gas operations company, is the only new company to break into the top 20. Fidelity Investments, ranked number 20 in 2011, falls to number 21 this year.\n\nWe saw an increase in the total number of companies this year, despite six companies going public. Burger King was only on the list for two years. It went private in fall of 2010 and returned to the public market in June of this year. Other notable IPOs were Caesar\u2019s Entertainment in February and OSI Restaurants Partners, parent of Outback Steakhouse and other restaurant chains, in August. The public company is now known as Bloomin\u2019 Brands.\n\nRevenue growth is the main reason behind the increase in the total number of companies on the private company list. There are 16 new companies on the 2012 list and all but two are there because sales increased over the $2 billion threshold. Jo-Ann Stores and Payless Holdings earned spots due to leveraged buyouts taking them private.\n\nOur list of largest private companies includes only firms with revenue greater than $2 billion. Most of the companies on our list have no plans to change their private status. Many businesses like the freedom from quarterly earning expectations and reduced obligations to Sarbanes-Oxley reporting requirements. (Private companies with publicly traded debt must file financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)\n\nIn addition to our $2 billion revenue requirement, the companies on our list have either too few shareholders to be required to file financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or have shares whose ownership is restricted to some group, such as employees or family members. We exclude foreign companies, companies that don\u2019t pay income tax (like Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority), mutually owned companies (like State Farm Insurance), cooperatives (like Central Grocers), companies with fewer than 100 employees, and companies that are more than 50% owned by another public, private or foreign company. We also leave out companies whose primary business is auto dealerships or real estate investment and/or management.\n\nWhenever possible, our revenue figures for each company exclude sales of publicly traded subsidiaries. For example, our $3.7 billion revenue estimate for Hallmark Cards excludes $323 million in revenue for its publicly traded subsidiary Cr0wn Media.\n\nOur data sources include voluntary disclosures by companies, Securities and Exchange Commission filing, and estimates from Forbes researchers and outside sources.\n\nEditors: Scott DeCarlo and Andrea Murphy\n\nPhoto Research: Jane Colihan, Merillee Santoro\n\nDevelopers: Ken Barney, Vishakha Bhansali, Louie Torres",

We don't want no pipeline drama,\" more than 350 demonstrators from activist groups, including CREDO Mobile and the Sierra Club, gathered near the Palo Alto home of Flipboard founder and CEO Michael McCue.\n\n\"We want to remind the president of his eloquent promises to address global warming,\" said CREDO Mobile President Michael Kieschnick. \"He doesn't like to be reminded of his promises.\"\n\nInside McCue's home, more than 100 supporters paid at least $2,500 to attend the fundraiser.\n\nLater Thursday, Obama attended an \"intimate\" dinner for 30 supporters at the palatial Portola Valley home of venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, where tickets cost $32,400 each.\n\nThe president thanked the Khosla family \"and these beasts\" - their big, shaggy dogs - for hosting the event. \"These two could eat Bo,\" he said, gesturing toward the creatures while referring to his own dog.\n\nLater in the talk, he urged an expansion of advanced technology to improve the education of the nation's children, noting that Silicon Valley is already far ahead of most places on this front.\n\nAs an example of what he has in mind, Obama pointed to a Mooresville, N.C., middle school that he visited Thursday morning, saying students there vastly improved their performance by moving to a laptop-based, high-tech teaching system.\n\n\"The passion that young people now have for learning ... because of that, the school has transformed itself,\" he said.\n\nHis said his goal is to have all American schools equipped with broadband and wireless access within five years, to not just transform the nation's educational system but also \"save money in the process.\"\n\nThe events were expected to raise about $1.2 million for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nIt was yet another California fundraising stop for Obama, who has included fundraisers on every one of the previous 13 trips he has taken to California as president.\n\nStill, he has not starred in a free, open-to-the-public Bay Area event since taking office in 2009.\n\nAfter The Chronicle reported that top loyal Democrats were grumbling that Obama doesn't appear at California events to discuss issues and that he only shows up at events where listeners must write a check to be in his presence, he scheduled an appearance Friday morning in San Jose to speak briefly about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut that event is open only to credentialed members of the media. Obama is meeting later on Friday and Saturday with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Sunnylands Estate in Rancho Mirage (Riverside County).\n\nIn Palo Alto Thursday, a few blocks from McCue's home, protesters were more focused on Obama's pending decision on the Keystone pipeline, which would carry petroleum extracted from the Canadian tar sands 1,700 miles across the U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSupporters of the Keystone pipeline say the project would bring much-needed jobs to the United States, where nearly 12 million people are unemployed, according to the Labor Department.\n\nBut while construction of the pipeline is estimated to create 42,100 temporary jobs, a State Department study projected it would add only 35 permanent jobs, mostly for pipeline inspection and maintenance.\n\nIn a March poll, two-thirds of the respondents to a survey by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center said they support building the pipeline.

Economics as such can\u2019t tell you what is good and what is evil. It can\u2019t tell you what values, tastes, and preferences to have. In spite of these limitations, economics has a lot to teach us about the effects of policies governments enact in the name of promoting good or punishing evil, or in pursuit of our values, tastes, and preferences.\n\nWe enter into a fundamental confusion when we base our discussions of policies on their stated goals rather than their likely effects. I doubt that many people seriously disagree that feeding the hungry and clothing the naked are unworthy objectives. A lot of the policies we enact in the name of these goals have unintended and positively counterproductive consequences. Here are just a couple of examples of the unintended consequences of interference with prices.\n\nThe unintended and undesirable consequences of attempts to implement rent control and minimum wages are pretty straightforward. Rent control and laws against \u201cprice gouging\u201d create shortages. Minimum wages create unemployment, particularly for those at the margins of society.\n\nThere are other effects that are more subtle but that are nonetheless real. There is more to an apartment than the monthly rent, and there is more to a job than a wage. Interfering with one aspect of an agreement between buyers and sellers encourages them to adjust on aspects of the agreement that aren\u2019t regulated.\n\nConsider housing. First, rent control opens the door to discrimination because prospective tenants can\u2019t compete with one another by offering higher rent for an apartment. In a market that is left to its own devices, everyone who wants an apartment at the market price gets one, and everyone who is willing to rent out an apartment at the market price finds a tenant. When the price is held below what the market will bear, landlords can be choosier about who they take on as tenants. In a free and competitive market, a bigoted landlord would at least have to pay for his bigotry in the form of lower profits. It\u2019s also likely that these lower profits would ultimately encourage him to find another line of work. When rents are controlled, the penalty for bigotry is effectively removed.\n\nWhen prices are controlled, people can also adjust the quality of the goods and services they are buying and selling. Rent control leads to lower-quality rental housing: if landlords have waiting lists for rent-controlled apartments, they have weaker incentives to be diligent about maintenance. Why should a landlord fix your leaky toilet when he can rent your apartment\u2014leaky toilet and all\u2014to someone for the same price tomorrow?\n\nWe should expect to see similar phenomena in the labor market. Wages are only one aspect of what makes a job desirable. Workers might value training, flexibility, freedom, or any of a number of other perquisites. Mandatory higher wages mean that workers and employers will adjust along some of these unregulated margins. Perhaps training is unpaid. Employees might have to pay for meals and uniforms that employers used to provide. Working conditions might deteriorate. Employers might not offer as much flexibility in scheduling as they did previously. Employees might not be able to work as many hours as they would like at the going wage. The list is practically endless, and these difficult-to-measure adjustments are among the reasons why a minimum wage probably makes everyone (workers and employers) worse off even though it might not cause job loss.\n\nWhen governments force people to accept more of one attribute of a job, they also force them to accept less of another. The debate over sweatshops provides a case in point: those who wish to mandate more \u201chumane\u201d working conditions in sweatshops don\u2019t recognize that workers and employers will compensate for these improved working conditions with lower wages or by reducing job quality on other margins.\n\nIt might be tempting to respond that this can be fixed with further interventions making discrimination illegal or defining and regulating the goods and services being traded. But people will innovate around these in unanticipated ways, which would necessitate further intervention. Eventually, we\u2019re left making policy to deal with the unintended consequences of the policy we enacted to deal with the unintended consequences of the first policy we enacted. Once the intervention snowball starts rolling, it\u2019s hard to stop.\n\nRachel Smith proofread this article.",

Gore was in the Candlestick players parking lot watching teammates laugh and joke when the tears started to flow. Coming from a winning program at the University of Miami, Gore was upset that players could be so lighthearted after yet another loss.\n\nNow Gore and the 49ers are a win away from capturing the NFC West title and securing a playoff berth for the first time since 2002. Gore is also 22 yards from surpassing Hall of Fame running back Joe Perry as the team's all-time leading rusher.\n\n\"I will,\" Gore said Friday when asked if he would celebrate earning a playoff berth in the eventuality of a win over St. Louis at home on Sunday. \"This is my seventh year, and a lot of us have been in this locker room for a while and there have been some tough times. Our goal was always to make it to the playoffs. It's the closest we have ever been - if we do it, I'll celebrate a little bit.\"\n\nOnly a little bit, because the 49ers are in the odd circumstance of potentially securing a playoff berth with four games remaining. They need to keep winning to assure a home playoff game and a first-round bye.\n\nBut first they need to get by the woeful and badly bruised Rams, the very team that ousted them from playoff contention last December. Players and coaches have reminded themselves this week of what the Rams did to them last year.\n\n\"Last year we needed to beat St. Louis to get into the playoffs and it didn't happen,\" tight end Delanie Walker said, referring to the 25-17 loss in St. Louis on the season's penultimate week. \"So we are going to take it like it's a playoff game and try to put them in the dirt.\"\n\nGore isn't the only one eager to get to the playoffs after such a long drought. Quarterback Alex Smith, who was taken at the top of Gore's 2005 draft class, has also allowed himself to think of playoff spoils.\n\nIt's \"something we've talked about every year and now all of a sudden to have it in our hands and the chance to clinch (the NFC West), it's great,\" Smith said. \"No question, this is what you work so hard for. We've put ourselves in a good situation and now we just need to go out on Sunday and finish it.\"\n\nFor Gore, becoming the team's rushing champion is clearly secondary to beating 2-9 St. Louis. But he does envision a memorable day at Candlestick if his heavily favored team can prevail and he can also get the record.\n\n\"The bigger picture is winning the game,\" Gore said. \"I would be happy to (get the record) this week; it would be a blessing, especially in front of our fans who have been with us for a while. It would be great.\"\n\nKevin Lynch writes for the Niner Insider blog at SFGate.com. E-mail comments to sportinggreen@sfchronicle.com.",

That's \"best friends forever.\"\n\nAll three expressions \u2014 and IMHO, or \"in my humble opinion\" \u2014 are among 900 new words included this week. Cracking the dictionary, however, is no easy task.\n\n\"The OED is quite cautious,\" said Graeme Diamond, OED's principal editor for new words.\n\nTerms made popular online are only included among the dictionary's 300,000 entries when they have crossed over into everyday use, Diamond said.\n\nAlthough the new abbreviations are associated with modern electronic communications, some are surprisingly old. The first confirmed use of OMG was in a 1917 letter by a British admiral.\n\n\"Things people think are new words normally have a longer history,\" Diamond said.\n\nEditors publish updates to the online Oxford every three months.\n\nThe OED's Internet version was launched in 2000 and gets 2 million hits a month from subscribers.

Johnson Jr., the legendary Federal jurist from Alabama whose historic civil rights decisions led to ostracism, cross-burnings and death threats but helped to change the face of the segregationist South in the 1950's and 1960's, died yesterday. He was 80.\n\nJudge Johnson fell last week and was hospitalized in Montgomery, Ala., but had returned home. He developed pneumonia, and died at home, said Wayne Greenhaw, a former reporter and a friend of the family. Burial will be on Tuesday in Haleyville, Ala.\n\nThe judge set standards in the South and often in the nation on voting rights, employment discrimination, affirmative action, the rights of mental patients to adequate care, and prison inmates to protection from inhuman conditions. But it was his knell for Jim Crow that was revered and reviled.\n\nFor anyone old enough to remember, the terrible images are indelible: the lynched black men, the firebombed churches, crowds shrieking hatred, a skirmish line of deputies on the Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., peaceful marchers attacked with cattle prods and snarling police dogs in Birmingham, and a defiant Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama vowing to stand in the schoolhouse door to bar black children.\n\nIn that turbulent era, with the national conscience tottering and a few courageous men and women asking Americans to decide what kind of people they wanted to be, Judge Johnson loomed as a towering figure -- an uncompromising defender of civil liberties who came to be known as the Federal judiciary's most influential, innovative and controversial trial jurist.\n\nHe was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower a year after the Supreme Court's school-desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education. Judge Johnson, a Republican in the Democratic South, arrived on the bench in Montgomery, Ala., on Nov. 7, 1955, just as the storm of the civil rights movement was about to break.\n\nThree weeks later, on Dec. 1, Rosa Parks, a black seamstress, refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white rider, as required by city law. Her arrest prompted a bus boycott led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a 26-year-old minister who had just moved to Montgomery for his first pastorate.\n\nJudge Johnson's first major ruling was to join the majority on a three-judge panel that struck down the Montgomery bus-segregation law as unconstitutional, applying the principle of Brown v. Board of Education: that separate but equal facilities were inherent violations of the due process and equal-protection clauses of the 14th Amendment. He would use that reasoning again and again to create a broad mandate for racial justice in Alabama and across the South.\n\nMany Crucial Decisions In Career on Two Courts\n\nIn a career that spanned almost four decades -- 24 years in Federal District Court in Alabama and 13 years on an appeals court with wide jurisdiction in the South -- Judge Johnson ordered the desegregation of public schools and colleges, parks, libraries, museums, depots, airports, restaurants, restrooms and other public places, as well as the Alabama State Police.\n\nIn 1965 he issued another historic order that allowed Dr. King to lead a 52-mile march from Selma to Montgomery to protest the denial of black voting rights. He did so after Alabama troopers clubbed marchers and used tear gas in a spectacle witnessed on television by a horrified nation, and after President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect the marchers.\n\nWhen state courts failed to act forcefully to end racial violence -- as in the case of Viola Liuzzo, a white civil rights worker from Detroit who was shot to death while riding in a car with a black man -- Judge Johnson sent the killers to jail on Federal civil rights charges.\n\nHis justice was often innovative, even in minor cases. In one case, theft charges were brought against a white man and four black men that he had hired to help him steal peanuts from a Federal warehouse. The jury acquitted the white man but convicted the blacks. Judge Johnson, poker faced, sentenced the black men to 30 minutes in custody.",

Any other starter might have been yanked long before he could pitch the worst inning by a Giant in 111 years. Manager Bruce Bochy believed - wrongly - that his Opening Day pitcher would stanch the bleeding.\n\nThe Cardinals, forced to sit through three days of World Series and Buster Posey hoopla, tagged Cain for nine runs in the fourth inning of a 14-3 drubbing that soured a day that began with the Giants' World Series ring ceremony.\n\n\"That was definitely exciting for all of us,\" Cain said. \"We were looking forward to seeing the rings. For myself and the rest of the guys, I wish I had done better to keep the excitement going. I'll try to remember the good part of the day, getting our rings and being excited about that.\"\n\nA crowd of 42,201 had to be wondering if an interloper had stolen a No. 18 Giants jersey and taken the mound after Cain retired the first nine Cardinals on 30 pitches. In the fourth inning, the Cards treated Cain like a batting-practice pitcher.\n\nSingles by Jon Jay and Matt Carpenter, followed by an Allen Craig sacrifice fly, halved a 2-0 Giants lead. Cain's day lasted eight more batters, and the only one he retired was pitcher Adam Wainwright, on a popped-up bunt.\n\nSt. Louis did not exactly pepper the gaps with baseballs. Cain walked two and allowed six singles among seven hits in the inning, with Matt Adams' two-run double the harshest blow.\n\nWhen Carlos Beltran hit a two-run single off Jose Mijares to score the two runners he inherited, Cain became the second Giant in the modern era to cough up nine runs in an inning. The other was John Cronin, against the Brooklyn Superbas, on Sept. 27, 1902.\n\nCain had his second nine-run game, the other beating also administered by St. Louis in 2008, and the Giants allowed their biggest inning since 2004.\n\nCain was not alone among aces Sunday. Opening Day starters David Price of the Rays, Cole Hamels of the Phillies and R.A. Dickey of the Blue Jays each allowed eight runs. The Nationals' Stephen Strasbourg was hammered for six. Even the Tigers' Justin Verlander lost after the Yankees got to him for a three-run inning.\n\n\"Baseball has a way of humbling guys,\" Cain said. \"You can go along great, and all of a sudden, it can set you back straight. The baseball gods find a way of evening things out.\"\n\nManager Bruce Bochy said even the best pitchers sometimes find a third out elusive.\n\nBuster Posey believes Cain's pitches caught more of the plate than usual. When a reporter asked Cain if he might have been tipping pitches, he said he would look at the tape but did not believe so.\n\nAll agreed that that Cardinals deserve credit for putting good swings on the ball, which Giants hitters have yet to do en masse.\n\nThey scored 15 runs in a 3-3 first week. Bochy acknowledged the offense is \"sputtering.\"\n\n\"We just have to keep plugging away,\" Hunter Pence said. \"We know we've got a lot of guys who are going to hit. All of us are going to have times when everything starts clicking. That's part of the game, especially early.\n\n\"Guys are really amped up. They want to try so hard. We've just got to stay steady, stay locked in and keep pushing.\"\n\nJohn Shea: Giants young and old are presented with World Series rings.

Critics of the administration of former president George W. Bush alleged that scientific findings were often influenced by politics.\n\nThe measure, passed by a voice vote, was attached as an amendment to the $819 billion House economic stimulus package.\n\nRep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who sponsored the measure with Rep. Todd R. Platts (R-Pa.), said it was relevant to the stimulus package because that legislation proposes to allot $550 billion in public funds, and \"we need to make sure these funds are effectively spent and that they are not lost due to any waste, fraud or abuse.\"\n\n\"Most significant,\" said seven watchdog organizations including the Government Accountability Project, the National Whistleblowers Center and the Union of Concerned Scientists, \"it creates a permanent shield for federal employee and contractor whistleblowers who challenge any misspending and it will keep protecting taxpayers long after stimulus funds are gone.\"\n\nLawmakers have been trying for nearly a decade to strengthen federal whistleblower protections. Last year, the House passed a bill identical to the measure approved by the chamber yesterday, and the Senate passed a similar bill.\n\nBut lawmakers were unable to find common ground and faced a veto from the Bush White House, which argued that the measure could compromise national security and was overly burdensome.\n\nVan Hollen said he is confident the Senate will consider the measure and that President Obama will support it.\n\nThe bill would extend rights to all national security whistleblowers, including those at the FBI and the intelligence agencies. Also covered are federal contract workers and 40,000 airport baggage screeners working for the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nIt gives those covered by the measure access to jury trials in federal district court to challenge reprisals and ends the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's monopoly on appellate reviews.",

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",

I have been a Fast Lane (now E-ZPass) pass holder since Day One, and have my funds drawn automatically from a credit card. It has never been a problem. That is until I planned a trip to North Carolina. Not knowing how much I would have to pay in tolls, I called E-ZPass to request that information. They apologized for not knowing, but said I should have plenty of credit on my account to avoid problems and they charged my card $125. It ended up costing a fraction of that in tolls. So, I asked for a refund and was told no. I have been using about $25 in tolls a year and don\u2019t know why the state should hold onto my money.\n\nA. It seems as though something got messed up in that initial conversation. If someone told you to deposit $125, it clearly wasn\u2019t a recommendation grounded in reality \u2014 or even common practice.\n\nMike Verseckes, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation, said that confidentiality rules prohibit him from discussing specific accounts or what happened in this case. However, he said, E-ZPass generally recommends having $50 in your account when you are traveling out of state, noting how expensive some New York City river crossings are. It can cost up to $10.25, for instance, to cross the George Washington Bridge using an E-ZPass.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t have automatic credit card billing to their account and prefer to replenish their E-ZPass as needed, the $50 rule should still cover out-of-state travel. In this case, given that you have an automatically replenishing account, there is really no good reason to have charged your account all that money.\n\nE-ZPass does make it seem a bit scary, saying that it can take at least three business days to credit your account when you are traveling out of state. But you would have to try really hard to drive on a lot of toll roads and cross a lot of bridges in a short amount of time to need $125.\n\nFortunately, after I reached out to try to straighten this out, E-ZPass refunded the excess funds due to the confusion in this case.",

Teespring helps people sell t-shirts. Custom, well-made t-shirts. And it\u2019s good at what it does.\n\nTeespring has sold 6 million shirts this year through its customers, hundreds of whom make more than $100,000 from their tee trade. At least ten, the company says, have become millionaires from the work. Teespring claims that one in 75 Americans owns a shirt it\u2019s helped sell in the last year. For 2015, the startup plans to go even bigger, and it\u2019s raised millions in venture backing to get ready. The two-year-old startup announced Tues. it\u2019s raised $35 million in a Series B round led by Khosla Ventures, with partner Keith Rabois joining the board. Earlier investors and board members include Lars Dalgaard of Andreessen Horowitz and Sam Altman of Y Combinator.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about t-shirts, it\u2019s not about crowd-funding, it\u2019s about the concept that bringing something to market should be as easy as the idea,\u201d says cofounder and CEO Walker Williams. \u201cAll we need is the visionaries with the ideas.\u201d\n\nHow Teespring works is that it handles the nitty-gritty of selling your own shirts, from payment to manufacturing and shipping. The idea came about as Williams and cofounder Evan Stites-Clayton were seniors at Brown University and a local favorite bar was closing. Amid the outpouring of student emotion on Facebook about that move, the entrepreneurs decided they wanted to sell shirts expressing support for the watering hole, only to find the logistics daunting. They eventually set up their own website and sold hundreds of shirts, then brought the idea to YC\u2019s startup accelerator.\n\nTeespring plans to use the money from Khosla Ventures to add more tools to make the design and selling process easy for its customers. The company employees 170 employees across offices in Providence, RI and San Francisco already, and is building a 300-employee manufacturing plant in Kentucky with the money from its last fund raise. Williams and Stites-Clayton have now raised $55 million overall.\n\nWhere Teespring could make a bigger impact, however, is if its model can work across a range of products. Right now, the company says it\u2019s happy to stay focused on its booming shirt business. But the back-end system that Teespring has build internally to handle its payments and logistics could prove valuable for many more types of entrepreneurs. \u201cT-shirts are to Teespring what books are to Amazon,\u201d Williams says. \u201cThey\u2019re a way of proving this hypothesis that if you remove every barrier, you can empower this type of entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nBut new investor Rabois at Khosla Ventures stresses that there\u2019s something special about shirts. \u201cT-shirts are incredibly self-expressive as a medium,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re a way of communicating your identity. This is a building block off of that feeling.\u201d\n\nThere have been plenty of online t-shirt companies before, not all of them successful. One buzzed-about shirt company, Threadless, announced layoffs in Jan. around the same time that Teespring raised its Series A. Rabois says that as an investor, he doesn\u2019t evaluate the business based on its 2014 competition but on where the startup can grow in later years. \u201cThis is a company committed to providing a platform for users to run and create a business from scratch. How many places in the world can you say that?\u201d Growth could lead to challenges for the company as its logistics have to keep up with demand (hence the new plant in Hebron, KY.) and as Teespring will have to make critical decisions about where it can extend its brand. Williams says Teespring\u2019s already enjoyed successful partnerships with companies like Twitch and could look to more influencer-driven deals in the future. Selling new products, however, would require new manufacturing and distribution expertise.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Teespring just sticks to t-shirts for the next few months, spending some of this money on more rapid customer acquisition through marketing and deals. Williams and his investors would still be excited about the company\u2019s ability to make other entrepreneurial types successful through the platform, whether they\u2019re selling their own bar shirts or a favorite design.\n\n\u201cI think Marx would be please if he were alive to witness Teespring enabling anyone to make money and contribute to a new and bigger economy,\u201d Dalgaard at Andreessen Horowitz wrote in a blog post Tues. \u201cTeespring puts any potential entrepreneur in business instantly.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Forbes, Twitter and Facebook for more coverage of startups, enterprise software and venture capital.",

Hopefully, the outpouring made the Honeycutts feel better after driving past those six hateful protesters who came from the Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas to harass them.\n\nGod forbid that I should have to bury a child. But if I did, and one of those despicable holy rollers showed up waving a sign in my face, talking about \"God killed your child as revenge against gays,\" there might well be another funeral. Some things are simply intolerable.\n\n\"I think it's horrible that anyone would try to disrespect the family of a man who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country,\" said Scott Mallary, who was holding one end of a 12-foot-long banner expressing gratitude for Honeycutt's service.\n\nMallary, like most of those I spoke with, was more concerned with supporting the Honeycutt family than mounting some counterprotest. But I wasn't the only one who was more than a little irritated with that Westboro clan.\n\nThe church, in Topeka, is led by a publicity-seeking homophobe, Fred J. Phelps. He knows that disrupting military funerals and the funerals of gays will probably make news.\n\nTo the credit of Charles officials, the protesters were kept about a quarter of a mile from the memorial service, which was held at the New Life Wesleyan Church in La Plata.\n\nBut the wing nuts still got to stand alongside the road, waving their insulting signs at the funeral procession.\n\nHoneycutt, 19, was a graduate of North Point High School in Waldorf. He was a recipient of the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He died Oct. 27 of wounds sustained while fighting in Afghanistan. After the services, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nResidents throughout Southern Maryland were alerted by e-mail and message groups that Westboro members were planning to disrupt the Honeycutt funeral. Thousands responded.\n\n\"They picked the wrong county this time,\" said Cathy Gilbert, who, along with hundreds of others, wore T-shirts that read, \"Thank You T.J.\"\n\nThe supporters also included a group of motorcyclists, the Patriot Riders, volunteers who provide protection to military families at funerals if invited.\n\nBravo to all of those who showed up.

There should be no taxes until the government goes back to work, says the Rap star known as Nelly. That is hardly a radical sentiment and others have said it too. Still, Nelly\u2013born Cornell Iral Haynes, Jr.\u2013does it with style. His campaign is reported here: Nelly For President! The M.O. Rapper Says No Taxes Until Government Shutdown Is Over. Whether you like Hip Hop, Rap, Jazz, Folk, Soul or Classical, it\u2019s easy to embrace Nelly\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to campaign, since the government ain\u2019t working, we shouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes,\u201d Nelly told VH1. \u201cBecause, you know, paying taxes is supposed to pay for the government, which in turn is not working. So if they\u2019re not working, I shouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes. And me being in the upper echelon of the tax bracket, feel that the money I could be saving over these next couple of days could be very vital to my survival\u2026So y\u2019all keep banging.\u201d\n\nRepublican or Democrat, it seems hard to argue with this logic. It\u2019s also nice to hear someone admit that they are paying considerable taxes, or as Nelly put it, in the upper echelon of the tax bracket. But high or low, everyone is a little tired of theatrics, of no service at the IRS and elsewhere. And yet taxes and filings are coming due like a freight train.\n\nIn fact, want to add insult to injury? Nelly is telling all of us we shouldn\u2019t have to pay until the federal government reopens for business. At the same time, the IRS is expressing the opposite, warning us all that we\u2019d better keep on filing and keep on paying. The IRS announced that:\n\nYes, the IRS issued a reminder that the Oct. 15 deadline remains in effect for filers who requested a six-month extension to file their tax return. Reminder: Oct. 15 Tax Deadline Remains During Appropriations Lapse. IR-2013-80, Oct. 8, 2013.\n\nAnd that reminder makes Nelly\u2019s musical message all that much more poignant. Of course, Nelly has featured in tax stories before, but none as downright sensible as this one. Back in 2006, around tax time, the story surfaced the Nelly should be deducting his jewel-encrusted teeth.\n\nThat made sense since they were celebrated in his hit single, Grillz. \u201dI got my mouth lookin\u2019 somethin\u2019 like a disco ball,\u201d Nelly and co-singer Paul Wall rapped in the hit. You can think of it as a rap ode to gem-encrusted dentures. See Celeb Tax Perks: Can Nelly Deduct His Grillz? There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that he deducted them, though he probably could have.\n\nAfter all, lesser entertainers have claimed bigger tax deductions than that. In fact, sometimes the more unusual and extreme the expense, the more normal it may seem. And in the entertainment world, it can seem that anything goes.\n\nNelly has sold more than 21 million albums over his career. That makes him one of the top handful of hip-hop artists. But one wonders if he isn\u2019t equally well suited to politics. After all, he is making considerably more sense than many in Washington these days.\n\nYou can reach me at Wood@WoodLLP.com.

Probably fecal matter, according to new research by London scientists.\n\nThat's right, poop \u2014 on your phone. If it's on your phone, it's very likely on your hands too, say researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Queen Mary, University of London.\n\nResearchers analyzed 780 swab samples \u2014 390 from mobile phones and 390 from the hands that used them \u2014 in 12 U.K. cities. They found that 16% of both hands and phones were contaminated with E. coli, potentially illness-causing bacteria that is fecal in origin. The likely reason: because people don't wash their hands after using the toilet.\n\nThat means people are spreading fecal bacteria not just to their phones, but to everything else they touch around them. E. coli can survive on hands and other surfaces for hours, especially in warm conditions (like on a smartphone screen), and is easily transferred to door handles, computer keyboards, food, other people \u2014 and back to you. If you contaminate your iPhone with fecal bacteria, then wash your hands, then handle your phone again, you've just re-soiled your clean hands.\n\nOverall, the researchers found that 92% of hands and 82% of phones showed some type of bacterial contamination. About a third of hands and a quarter of phones contained Staphylococcus aureus, common bacteria that live on skin but can cause illness if they enter the bloodstream.\n\nWhen surveyed, however, 95% of people said they washed their hands with soap. \"People may claim they wash their hands regularly, but the science shows otherwise,\" said study co-author Dr. Ron Cutler of Queen Mary, University of London in a statement.\n\nTwo guesses who the nastier gender is. \"In previous studies, we found that men's hands were more contaminated than women's, and also that men wash hands less often than women in public restrooms,\" says Dr. Val Curtis of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n\nPeople in the current study who had bacteria on their hands were three times more likely to have contaminated phones as well. The findings don't mean that your cell phone is necessarily a hotbed of disease, but that it could be. \"The bugs we found are more or less harmless,\" says Curtis, but notes that the presence of fecal bacteria like E. coli means that if \"someone was ill, then they would be likely to transmit pathogens to others.\" Other bugs like campylobacter, norovirus and salmonella, which are more likely to cause illness, can also be passed through feces.\n\nThe current study was conducted in Brits, but there's not much reason to think Americans are any more hygienic. And mobile phones are hardly the only objects teeming with bugs around you. Stop and think about every place scientists have ever turned up fecal bacteria \u2014 grocery store carts, swimming pools, fast-food restaurant soda fountains and kids' play areas, ATM keypads, your purse, your washing machine, prewashed salad greens, food court trays, and pretty much everything in a hotel room \u2014 and it makes it hard to lay your hands on anything again.\n\nBut before you swaddle yourself in a hazmat suit, remember there's actually an easy way to avoid infection: wash your hands, especially after you use the bathroom. (If you think your hands haven't been contaminated after using the toilet because you didn't touch anything in there, think again.) Need a primer on hand washing? Use soap and water to clean all surfaces of your hands, including between your fingers and under your nails. Wash for 20 seconds. Don't touch anything in public bathrooms, if you can help it. Use paper towels to turn the faucets and to open the door. If you don't have access to soap and water, then at least use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n\nThe authors of the new study say they will submit their paper for publication, following further analysis of the types of phones and users sampled and more detailed bacterial and viral profiling.",

A hospital spokesman said the Ambassador was in critical condition with a bullet wound in the head.\n\nAccording to reports from the hotel, as Mr. Argov left the party and walked a few yards along Park Lane, a man who had been loitering at a nearby automobile showroom jumped forward. Shots were heard and the Ambassador fell to the ground.\n\n''He was slumped on the floor just by his car,'' said Moses Hayes, a Tonga Embassy driver waiting near the hotel entrance. ''He was shot outside just by his car.''\n\nThe attacker ran off, pursued by a member of the Metropolitan Police Diplomatic Protection Group who was guarding Mr. Argov. Shots were heard from around the corner, in South Street, and the man thought to be the attacker fell to the pavement. He, too, was taken to the hospital, where he was said to have a bullet wound in his head.\n\n''The assailant is now under guard in the intensive care unit in hospital but is expected to live,'' a Scotland Yard spokesman said. Robert Maxwell, a British publisher, who was only yards away from Mr. Argov when he was shot, said later, ''There was a loud burst of shots just as the Ambassador was coming out of the hotel.''\n\nHe said shots had been fired from a submachine gun held by an assailant of Arab appearance. According to Mr. Hayes's description, the man was about 5 feet 6 inches tall and was carrying a pack on his shoulder.\n\n''The attack was all so fleeting,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''It has left me shocked and disgusted.'' A Scotland Yard spokesman said a car fitting the description of a vehicle seen waiting near the Dorchester had been stopped in Brixton, across the Thames River in South London, and two men had been detained. The spokesman said a weapon had been seized.\n\nIsraeli and British officials declined to speculate on the identity or background of the assailant or assailants, but they evidently believed that the attack had been politically motivated. Earlier Attacks on Israelis\n\nIt was the fourth recent such incident against Israeli diplomats, but the first in Britain. On April 3, Yacov Barsimantov, an official of Israeli Embassy in Paris, was fatally shot by a young woman in his apartment. Three days earlier, attackers sprayed the offices of the Israeli military attache in Paris with machine-gun fire.\n\nAlthough a shadowy Beirut-based group called the Lebanese Revolutionary Armed Faction claimed responsibility, Israel accused the Palestine Liberation Organization in the two attacks. Just before that, there had been an attack on Israeli officials in Vienna.\n\nThe Barsimantov shooting was discussed by the Israeli Cabinet, which later said it would regard attacks on officials anywhere as a breach of the cease-fire between Israel and the P.L.O. in southern Lebanon. Area Is Sealed Off\n\nAfter the attack here, the police sealed off the area along Park Lane, which borders on Hyde Park. By the gutter, a few yards from the hotel entrance, a policeman stood guard under the glare of floodlights that illuminated a section of blood-spattered pavement and a pile of white, blood-soaked rags.\n\nMembers of the Board of Deputies of British Jews gathered at the home of Martin Savitt, vice president of the board, to await news of the Ambassador's condition. Mr. Argov, who has represented Israel here since September 1979, is a respected and well-liked diplomat on his second tour here.\n\nHe had studied political science at Georgetown University in Washington, where he was awarded a bachelor's degree, and international relations at the London School of Economics, where he received a master's degree.\n\nMr. Argov served in the army from 1947 to 1950 and began his Government career in 1955 in the Prime Minister's Office. Since then, he has served in Lagos, Nigeria; Accra, Ghana; New York, Washington, Mexico City and, just before his arrival here, as Ambassador to the Netherlands.\n\nHe is married, with a son and two grown daughters who live in Israel.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Shlomo Argov (Page A10)",

Despite efforts to hold down costs, unanticipated Medicaid expenses are helping to break the budgets of about two-thirds of the states, including New York. Since 1967, costs have swelled nationally from $1.9 billion to $21.7 billion, of which just over half is paid by Washington.\n\nThe Massachusetts plan has reportedly struck a responsive chord among Reagan officials, who have been trying to limit Medicaid costs. Moreover, the approach would presumably reduce regulation and the Government's role in the program.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said only that the proposal was ''under review.'' Massachusetts health officials believe that, by reversing the disincentives to save money, they can cut Medicaid costs by 20 percent or more without damaging the quality of care. They say, for example, that they are forced to spend $40 million to $50 million a year for Medicaid patients who unnecessarily use emergency rooms for routine ailments. The state is obliged to pay even though care is much cheaper in doctors' offices and clinics.\n\n''There is no gatekeeper to the system,'' Charles F. Mahoney, Secretary of Human Services in Massachusetts, said in an interview here yesterday. ''We've got an a la carte system. Patients can go anywhere and buy anything and we have to pay the bill.''\n\nThe plan proposed by Gov. Edward J. King has been tried in some small, isolated areas, but this would be the first time it would be tested on a large population - 550,000 poor people throughout Massachusetts. The idea closely resembles the subscriber-paid plans, called health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, that many middle-class people belong to either individually or through their employers. Most of those on Medicaid are welfare recipients who do not work. The Way It Would Work\n\nThis is how it would work: First the Legislature would be asked to set an overall spending cap of $839 million, or $237 million less than the $1.076 billion it would take to continue the program as is. Then private health providers - doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacies and the like - would be asked to form ''intermediaries,'' separate corporations that would run the program.\n\nEach intermediary - there might be only one - would get an annual per-capita fee for each patient it enrolled. It would be responsible for that patient's care. If efficient, it would make a profit; if not, it would lose money without further state reimbursement.\n\nMr. Mahoney conceded that such a system might invite abuse because there was a built-in incentive not to provide care. To counter this, he said the state would retain a major role in monitoring and evaluating the intermediaries. ''We are not suggesting going to an unbridled system,'' he said.\n\nIf used nationally, he believes, the plan could save $6 billion to $7 billion a year. Mr. Mahoney hopes to get a waiver from the Federal Health Care Financing Administration within a month or two so that the proposal can be taken before the forthcoming session of the Legislature. If it fails, he said, the only alternative will be to cut Medicaid services and eligibility.",

Florio waited patiently tonight for results of the gubernatorial contest. Early optimism turned to caution as the early tallies came in and swung against him.\n\nThe candidate's top strategists, gathered in the ballroom of the Cherry Hill Inn, were jubilant minutes after the polls closed. The chairman of the state Democratic Party, James Maloney, said the race was Mr. Florio's at 8:03 P.M. and described the unofficial victory as ''a screeching halt to the White House.''\n\nMr. Florio's campaign director, Charles Mannella, a red carnation in his buttonhole, exclaimed: ''We've been waiting for this for five years.''\n\nBut an hour later, the mood had changed from confident optimism to one of resolution. ''It will be a long night,'' Fred Hillman, Mr. Florio's press secretary said. ''It will be close, we will win.'' An Exhausted Candidate\n\nHoarse and exhausted from campaigning, Mr. Florio was still closeted in his suite upstairs in the Cherry Hill Inn shortly after 10 P.M. He slept for part of the afternoon, and was joined early in the evening by two of his three children, Catherine, 17 years old, and Gregory, 20. Mr. Florio's younger brother, Richard, arrived at 9:30 P.M.\n\nMany of Mr. Florio's longtime political associates, who had worked with him during his rise in Camden County politics, clustered around television sets in the ballroom. They remained firmly optimistic that votes in South Jersey would make Mr. Florio the winner.\n\nState Assemblyman Martin A. Herman unpacked a pint-sized champagne glass inscribed, ''Governor James Florio.'' ''In South Jersey there is intense loyalty for Jim Florio,'' Mr. Herman said. ''I don't think the polls have given added weight to what is going to happen here.'' A Pragmatic Moderate\n\nMr. Florio, a moderate who takes pride in his pragmatic approach to politics, termed this campaign a referendum on Ronald Reagan and emphasized his own view that government should be ''lean and thrifty'' but not ''mean.''\n\nA skilled and relentless campaigner, who in the last three weeks made up to 20 appearances in one day from the northern to the southern tip of the state, Mr. Florio first ran for the State Assembly in 1969.\n\nIn the State Legislature, he is perhaps best remembered for twice voting against a state income tax. In 1974, he was the first Democrat in more than a century to win in the First Congressional District, which includes all of Gloucestor and most of Camden County, and he has gained impressive majorities since.\n\nMr. Reagan won Camden County last year, but Mr. Florio retained his House seat with 78 percent of the vote. An Appeal to Chauvinism\n\nAs the first Democratic candidate for Governor from the southern part of the state in recent political history, he appealed to southern chauvinism throughout the campaign.\n\nIn an effort to bring the blue-collar voters back to the Democratic column after their defection to President Reagan, Mr. Florio, the first Italian-American to run for Governor in New Jersey, made much of his working class background. He was born in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, the son of a first-generation Italian-American shipyard painter. He dropped out of Erasmus Hall High School, served in the Navy for four years and then, after picking up his high school diploma, graduated from Trenton State College and Rutgers University Law School.\n\nHe became an industrious worker in the Democratic organization in Camden and impressed its leader, Mayor Angelo J. Errichetti of Camden. Mr. Florio split with Mr. Errichetti in 1979, a year before the Mayor was convicted in the Federal Abscam investigation into political corruption.\n\nBecause of his interest in building a political base in Camden County, it took several years for Mr. Florio to devote his full attention to Congress. But by 1978, he had won the chairmanship of the House Subcommittee on Transportation and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over two areas of importance to New Jersey: toxic wastes and railroads.\n\nHe sponsored the Superfund legislation, which taxes chemical companies to create a fund used to dispose of dangerous toxic wastes, and last year's railroad deregulation bill.\n\nMr. Florio was an amateur light middleweight boxer during his Navy years and he sometimes indulges in tough sporting language to get his message across. By tonight, his ceaseless campaigning had cost him 12 pounds.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of James Florio",

Fuel use overall is slowing as the busy summer driving season winds down.\n\nThe biggest producers such as No. 1 Archer Daniels Midland Co and Green Plains Inc said they have benefited this summer from better-than-expected fuel demand as low gas prices have boosted driving. And their plants are in the heart of corn country, where they can rely on ample supplies, sometimes delivered straight from farmers' fields.\n\nBut plants such as those in Wyoming and Virginia that suspended operations this week were built in the ethanol boom years of the 2000s when the promise of increased U.S. government blending mandates could justify the cost of having to buy railcars full of corn from hundreds of miles away. That is no longer the case for some of these \"destination\" plants.\n\nAnd demand is falling. With gasoline cheaper than ethanol in some parts of the country, little demand is seen beyond the U.S. government blending requirements that mandate nearly every gallon of gasoline sold in the United States contain 10 percent ethanol.\n\nEthanol for November delivery on the futures market was trading at $1.43 per gallon while November gasoline was at $1.40 per gallon on Wednesday.\n\n\"It's a difficult environment,\" said Andrew Clyde, chief executive of Murphy USA Inc, owner of the 110-million-gallon-per-year Hereford Renewable Energy LLC plant in Hereford, Texas, which is up for sale.\n\n\"You've got to be performing among the best assets if you're out of the Corn Belt to be profitable,\" he said, adding that the plant was not losing money. \"Even in the worst crush-spread environment, we've been at least break-even.\"\n\nWyoming Ethanol LLC and Vireol Bio Energy LLC in Virginia were shutting down this week, with Vireol looking for a buyer of its plant. Each facility was the sole ethanol plant in its respective state.\n\nWhile the loss in production tied to these closures is small - the two plants in Wyoming and Virginia represent less than 1 percent of U.S. capacity - it reflects continuing consolidation in an industry that sucks up about a third of the 13-billion-bushel U.S. corn crop.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised to see more,\" said a Midwest ethanol trader. \"Some of the destination plants will shut down or at least consider it.\"\n\nThe ethanol industry last suffered a wave of closures when corn prices shot to historic highs in 2012 due to drought.\n\nThis time, even large operators in the corn heartland of the Midwest may have to extend seasonal shutdown periods this month if conditions do not improve, industry sources said.\n\nBut plants far from the Corn Belt in places like Texas, Arizona and Georgia could be most at risk, they said.\n\n\"We're in a corn deficit area. Margins have been challenged,\" said Eric Wilkey, president of Arizona Grain, which supplies corn to Pinal Energy LLC's ethanol plant, south of Phoenix, Arizona, which has capacity to produce 50 million gallons annually.\n\n\"We let the market dictate how hard we run the plant. The market tells us not to run at capacity,\" Wilkey said, declining to offer further details.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Hirtzer in Chicago and Chris Prentice in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)",

Sheerer, who handled identification-badge systems in three states, stored the sensitive data on a thumb drive and then placed it on a server at his home. A private security firm discovered the breach after Google indexed the information and made it public. There is no evidence that anyone other than a researcher at the security firm found the data. The Washington Times has the full story.\n\nSEAL leaders warn ex-members against disclosing secrets in books: The top admiral and enlisted man in the U.S. Navy SEALs last week warned members of the force not to disclose classified information for publicity or cash.

Tiffany Clark, 34, of Danbury, carried the guns into Terminal 4 at about 10:30 a.m. Monday and told Port Authority police she wanted to take the firearms with her on a trip to San Francisco, officials said. She was arrested and PA cops recovered two guns, a Kimer .45-caliber and a Ruger .380, and six loaded magazines inside her suitcases, authorities said. Clark claimed the pistols were licensed in Connecticut, but never produced proof, officials said. Even if she had permits, she still would have been charged with breaking New York laws, according to PAPD spokesperson Joe Pentangelo.

Jerry Brown's Proposition 30 tax-hike initiative belongs to the San Francisco Giants' top shareholder, billionaire investor Charles B. Johnson.\n\nRecords on file with the secretary of state show that Johnson, the chairman and co-founder of Franklin Resources, has contributed $200,000 of the $1.1 million amassed to defeat the tax measure, making him far and away the single biggest donor.\n\nStill, the opposition money pales in comparison with the more than $31 million that Brown and his troops have raised in their quest to pass Prop. 30.\n\nJohnson declined our request for an interview. But it's no secret that the wealthy would be among the hardest hit by Prop. 30, which would jack up the tax rate on taxable income of more than $1 million to 13.3 percent from the current 10.3 percent.\n\n\"I was unaware of it, and it has no connection to the Giants,\" team President Larry Baer said Friday when told of Johnson's anti-Prop. 30 contributions.\n\nBy the way, Johnson also dropped $50,000 into the campaign for Proposition 32, which would bar unions and corporations from using automatic payroll deductions to fund political activities.\n\nFighting words: Richmond City Councilman Corky Booz\u00e9 says he was roughed up the other night outside a candidates forum by a well-known ally of Mayor Gayle McLaughlin and her Richmond Progressive Alliance.\n\nBooz\u00e9 and the progressives have been at odds over a number of issues, most recently the hotly contested soda tax on the city's Nov. 6 ballot. McLaughin and her allies back it, and Booz\u00e9 is opposed.\n\nAccording to Booz\u00e9, as he arrived at the Brickyard Cove Marina in Point Richmond on Thursday night, David Moore, a local activist and onetime supporter, approached and started talking about \"how I had bullied the mayor at City Council meetings, and he was sick of it.\"\n\nAfter a few more words, the councilman says, he turned to walk away.\n\n\"Suddenly, I felt a punch to the back of my head,\" Booz\u00e9 said.\n\nHe turned, and Moore punched him a second time in the temple, he said.\n\n\"Then he swung again and tore the pocket off my shirt,\" the councilman said.\n\nThat's when a plainclothes cop who was standing nearby stepped in.\n\nUniformed officers were called, and Moore was taken to police headquarters and booked on suspicion of battery. He was later released and given a court date.\n\nIn an e-mail to us, Moore didn't deny the story, except to assert that it all started when \"Corky punched me in the face and I tried to hit him back.\"\n\nBy the way, Booz\u00e9 isn't the only one mixing it up in Richmond. His volunteer chief of staff had a restraining order issued against her after what Booz\u00e9 would describe only as \"an altercation\" with a member of the city manager's staff, and she has been barred from City Hall while the matter is under investigation.\n\nPower Pak: It took some outside muscle, but San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee stopped a surprise attempt by Supervisor Jane Kim to take over the commission being set up to oversee the city's remaining redevelopment projects, like Mission Bay and the old Hunters Point Naval Shipyard.\n\nThe drama started Monday when word flew through City Hall that Kim - a supposed ally of the mayor - was putting forth a measure the next day to give the Board of Supervisors three of the five appointments to the new redevelopment commission that would have gone to the mayor.\n\nLee promptly got on the phone with Kim, who some believe wants to be the next Board of Supervisors president, and had what the mayor's people described as a \"very tough\" conversation.\n\nBut the real message came the next day when Lee backer Rose Pak - the Chinatown fundraiser and activist who was critical to Kim's election in 2010 - showed up at City Hall.\n\nWe don't know what Pak said to Kim, but when the meeting started, Kim pulled the measure from the agenda, saying the votes weren't there anymore.\n\nThe mayor's staff \"asked me if I could talk to her,\" Pak said later. \"From what I can tell, there was just a lot of miscommunication.\"\n\nAnd if there is one thing that Pak knows how to do, it's communicate.\n\nThe same can't be said for Kim, who did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross appear Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays.

I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\"\n\nThe court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time.\n\nProsecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof.\n\n\"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\"\n\nMr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year.\n\nHe said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan.\n\nThe court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return.\n\nHe also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping.\n\nHe was prescribed medication for stress.\n\nDefence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine.\n\n\"This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.\n\n\"He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.\"\n\nJudge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",

Because of these factors, the odds of a woman sustaining an injury while wearing a seatbelt were 47 percent higher than for men wearing seatbelts.\n\nOne reason safety systems are designed more for the male population is that men are three times more likely to be involved in a car crash that leads to serious or fatal injuries. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in female drivers getting into these types of accidents.\n\nAlthough Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety says that the study had the right concept, it doesn\u2019t apply to today\u2019s vehicles.

The cause of death was not reported.\n\nMr. Schorr, a senior news analyst with National Public Radio for the past 25 years, was one of a handful of reporters with firsthand knowledge of newsmakers from the 1950s through the 2000s.\n\nRecruited to CBS by the legendary Edward R. Murrow in 1953, he had the first televised interview with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and won three Emmy Awards for his coverage of the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe Washington Post's Bob Woodward in 1977 called Mr. Schorr \"certainly one of the finest broadcast journalists, and . . . one of the toughest reporters in the business.\" Mr. Schorr was as fearless in exposing government misdeeds as he was in taking on his employers, including CBS board Chairman William S. Paley and CNN founder Ted Turner.\n\n\"It must mean something that, unable to accept the dictates of my bosses, I ended up in confrontations with Bill Paley after a quarter-century at CBS and with Ted Turner after six years with CNN,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"Staying Tuned\" (2001). \"It may be that I am just hard to get along with, but to me it always seemed that some principle was involved.\"\n\nPresident Richard M. Nixon ordered the FBI to investigate Mr. Schorr, but viewers liked the newsman's challenges to the powerful. Mr. Schorr's outsider status was confirmed in 1973, as he read Nixon's enemies list during a live broadcast from the Senate Watergate hearings.\n\nReading through the top 20 names, he came to his own name at No. 17, with a notation \"a real media enemy.\"\n\n\"I managed not to gasp,\" he later wrote. \"I broke into a big sweat. This was the most electrifying moment in my career.\"\n\nBut not the most important, in his own judgment. That came in 1975, when he had a scoop on the \"CBS Evening News\" that said the CIA, under several administrations, had tried to assassinate Fidel Castro and other Third World leaders. That story set off a Senate investigation that concluded the CIA had not actually killed anyone, \"albeit not for want of trying,\" Mr. Schorr said.\n\nWhile reporting on FBI and CIA scandals in 1976, he alone acquired a secret investigative report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Leaks from the report were making headlines, but when CBS would not agree to publish the full document in print, as it had done in other instances, Mr. Schorr gave it to the Village Voice newspaper.\n\nThe national press did not hail him as a hero, which surprised Mr. Schorr. That ambivalence stemmed from reports that he accepted money for the leak and that he allowed others to falsely believe that reporter Lesley Stahl had taken the report from his desk and given it to the paper.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee, seeking his source, threatened him with contempt of Congress, and CBS suspended him. In public testimony, Mr. Schorr mounted an eloquent defense. \"To betray a source would be to betray myself, my career and my life,\" he declared. \"I cannot do it.\"",

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

Tom McClintock, R-Elk Grove (Sacramento County), that could take away future funding for the project.\n\nThe subway also faces unanticipated challenges in Union Square, where opponents may sue to stop a station in the park, and in North Beach, where merchants are fighting plans to close lanes on busy Columbus Avenue, where the tunneling machines will be removed.\n\nDespite the plethora of problems, transportation agency officials say they're optimistic the Central Subway will move forward.\n\n\"The Central Subway will not only improve transportation within San Francisco, but it will also enhance connections to the regional and statewide transit network,\" said Ed Reiskin, director of transportation for the agency. \"The project has been vetted by every level of government and given high marks every step of the way.\"\n\nThe subway, in the works since 2000, is an extension of the T-Third Muni Metro line that will connect the Caltrain station at Fourth and King streets to Chinatown and is projected to carry 35,000 riders a day by 2030.\n\nMunicipal Transportation Agency officials say the rail line, scheduled to open in 2019, will deliver reliable transit service to the underserved northeastern section of the city, especially Chinatown, which has the city's most transit-dependent population.\n\nCritics such as Save Muni say the project provides too little benefit for too much money and fear that operating it will deplete other Muni service.\n\nKristen Holland, a transportation agency spokeswoman, said the city expects to get the federal funding guarantee in September. She anticipates the McClintock amendment will be tossed when conflicting House and Senate bills are reconciled in conference committee, probably in the fall.\n\nA more immediate problem is North Beach opposition to plans to dig a big hole to remove the tunnel-boring machines. Although the subway will end in Chinatown at Stockton and Clay streets, the agency approved plans years ago to keep digging to North Beach, making it easier to remove the machines and giving the subway a head start on future extensions to North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf. The agency lacks funds to build a North Beach station or go to the wharf now.\n\nNorth Beach merchants say they weren't given enough warning of plans to close a single lane of Columbus, between Union and Filbert streets, to relocate utilities, and to shut down two lanes soon after for 18 months of digging. Business owners fear noise, dust and gridlock will drive tourists away.\n\n\"North Beach is such a great place to live and visit,\" said Jon Golinger, president of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers. \"But you wouldn't want to sit in front of Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store Cafe eating a sandwich with dust flying in the air.\"\n\nMunicipal Transportation Agency officials have met with merchants and Board of Supervisors President David Chiu, who represents the area, to try to work out a deal that will allow construction while satisfying merchants.\n\nChiu has backed the subway but objects to how the construction will affect his district.\n\n\"I'm deeply frustrated by the nonexistent outreach to North Beach, but I am committed to continuing to work with merchants, neighbors and the SFMTA to find a real alternative to the current extraction plan,\" Chiu said.\n\nBut if digging starts before merchants are satisfied, some of them are threatening to sue.\n\nCity officials already anticipate litigation from subway foes Save Muni challenging plans to build a station in Union Square, based on an arcane section of city law requiring voter approval of any nonrecreational construction in a city park.\n\nThe city attorney's office, citing a 1981 court opinion on a sewer project in a park, considers the law inapplicable. Others say the Municipal Transportation Agency could persuade a judge that the subway is recreational because it would take people to and from the park.\n\nMeanwhile, on Fourth Street, pile drivers pound and dust flies as crews prepare to start tunneling early next year. Save Muni wants the transportation agency to stop work at least until federal funding is guaranteed.\n\n\"The MTA's motivation is for public relations: to create a sense of inevitability to get funding,\" said Howard Wong, a member of the group. \"They're moving ahead with this to fund their staff rather than protecting taxpayers.\"\n\nMichael Cabanatuan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

A good many women, who supposedly constitute the majority of the audience for television movies, should enjoy watching some of their fantasies brought to living-color life.\n\nIsabel Cooper has been Lyman James's executive secretary since her husband died 15 years ago. She lives with her frail but perky mother and is a paragon of loyalty and devotion. She is also an exceptionally capable businesswoman, frequently coming to the rescue of her grateful boss. But when Lyman fails to get the presidency position he had been expecting, Isabel's safe little world of diet lunches and pretty office plants begins to falter.\n\nLyman takes a part-time consultancy job with another company and offers to keep Isabel as his part-time secretary, observing, ''The wonderful thing is we can ease into this retirement business together.'' Isabel is tempted, realizing that although he is married, their 15-year relationship was also a marriage ''in a way.'' She sings the secretary's familiar lament: ''I share his fate.''\n\nBut then there is Wynn Thomas, the younger man who is brought in from the outside and made company president. Isabel is not overly impressed with his smooth ways and disarming candor. When Wynn, after extensive interviewing of candidates, decides that he wants Isabel to be his secretary, she indignantly refuses but is finally persuaded by Wynn that the opportunity is too good to turn down. She rejects a $100-a-week pay increase in favor of $50 after convincing Wynn that every secretary in the company should also get $50 more. The fantasies are exceedingly clever.\n\nThis, mind you, is just the beginning. Isabel quickly becomes more than an ordinary secretary to Wynn. He insists that she attend board meetings as his assistant and adviser. She eventually is given an executive position that was once the exclusive territory of men. Then suddenly, as things are apt to happen in this type of project, Lyman's wife is killed in a plane crash and, before long, Isabel is being seriously courted by her former boss. Will she settle into a very comfortable existence as the wife of wealthy businessman? Or will she continue pursuing her own career in corporate corridors, where she now has a secretary of her own? That, in case you hadn't guessed, is the choice Isabel has to make.\n\nOliver Hailey's script has about as much spontaneity and insight as a job resume. But this Stuart Millar-Pantheon Television production, directed by Guy Green, uses a good cast to hold things together. As Isabel, Jean Stapleton continues shucking her Edith Bunker image with a performance of cool understatement. She may not look the part of an efficient executive, precisely, but her Isabel is always admirably believable\n\nOffering most capapble support are Richard Kiley as Lyman, Peter Coyote as her new boss, Betsy Palmer as a secretary in assertiveness training and, as a special treat, Mildred Dunnock as Isabel's mother. Miss Dunnock has little more to do than be friskily cute - ''I had a rather rowdy dream last night,'' she announces with relish - but she does it wonderfully. Thus can minor details be crucial to the experience of watching television.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Jean Stapleton",

If your bathtub is made of porcelain, cast iron, or fiberglass, it can be refinished.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of refinishing versus replacing your tub depends on the cost of tub removal, dumping, and the cost of the new tub itself, as well as installation. This is especially true for \"period tubs\", like old claw-foot tubs. For example, The Fine FInish Shop, an expert painting company near Boston, lists $349 as their standard price for refinishing a bathtub, whereas vintage-style claw-foot tubs are generally listed in the high $900's to the thousands.\n\nThe process of refinishing a bathtub is a lot like auto-body work. Uneven or damaged surfaces are etched, then primed, then spray painted with a special enamel. Sometimes the entire tub needs to be refinished, and sometimes just a portion of the tub needs to be refinished. It costs less to refinish just a portion of the bathtub. In some cases, the bathtub refinishing professional only needs to clean the tub in order to restore it to its former glory.\n\nProfessional refinishing: The best option for refinishing your bathtub is to hire a professional to refinish it. As I said, refinishing a tub is a lot like auto-body work. The margin for error is high, and the chemicals used in the process must be properly contained and ventilated. Refinishing your bathtub is not an unskilled, easy DIY job. Considering that it really doesn't cost that much (compared to replacing the bathtub), hiring skilled refinishing company who specializes in this kind of work could cost you less in time and money in the long run than doing it yourself.\n\nDIY Tub and Tile Refinishing: If you must, and I don't recommend it, DIY tub and tile refinishing kits exist, and can be found at your local home improvement store. Let the buyer beware: Though these kits can offer quick aesthetic improvements, in the long run their users have some pretty serious complaints, including peeling and wearing off of the finish.\n\nLet's wrap this up: The bottom line with bathtub refinishing is it is generally more cost efficient to have a contractor refinish your bath tub than to replace the tub or to do it yourself.\n\nChaya Kurtz writes for Networx.com.\n\nClick to view original post.",

            "answer": "Depending on the material that your bathtub is made of, you might have the option to refinish it rather than replace it. If your bathtub is made of porcelain, cast iron, or fiberglass, it can be refinished. The cost-effectiveness of refinishing versus replacing your tub depends on the cost of tub removal, dumping, and the cost of the new tub itself, as well as installation. This is especially true for period tubs, like old claw-foot tubs. For example, The Fine FInish Shop, an expert painting company near Boston, lists $349 as their standard price for refinishing a bathtub, whereas vintage-style claw-foot tubs are generally listed in the high $900's to the thousands."

San Franciscans who loathe private automobiles will question why another parking garage should even exist.\n\nBut there's kinetic beauty in a structure that's designed to be glimpsed on the move, or out of the corner of your eye, and to shift in tone the next time you look. It taps into a basic truth - that smart buildings fuse the reality of what they do with the potential of where they are.\n\nHere, the location is a site on the 16th Street traffic corridor across from the backside of UCSF-Mission Bay. Interstate 280's ramps cut by on the west. The east side of the block contains the 289-bed UCSF Mission Bay Medical Center, which opens in 2015 and so far is another institutional-looking piece of Mission Bay, complete with beige walls of precast concrete.\n\nWhile the parking garage exists to serve the hospital, they look nothing alike. Instead, the architects at WRNS Studio treated the garage as a self-contained presence on the evolving urban landscape.\n\nThe garage begins with an open ground floor beneath a layer of perforated white aluminum. From there on up, the cladding stacks eight rows of panels 10 feet high that contain blades in a dusky tone dubbed Champagne bronze.\n\nAll the blades on a given panel line up the same way, but there are five distinct alignment patterns ranging from straight-out to all-but-shut. As a vertical counterpoint, taller fins of white aluminum occasionally break the rhythm of horizontal steel.\n\nAssemble the varied panels in seemingly random procession and it's as though energy is rippling in place. Drive north on I-280 and the walls seem to fan open as you pass; the walk along 16th reveals a mosaic with sections that glow or fade as clouds pass and the sun heads west.\n\n\"We could have set all the blades at a certain angle, but then there would be angles from which you could see inside the whole time,\" said Kyle Elliot of WRNS, who led the design effort. \"We wanted a layered sense of translucency where the dynamics are always changing.\"\n\nWhat makes this more than a gimmick is the care with which the pieces have been arranged, and the attention paid to how people might encounter the whole.\n\nViewed by an observer on foot, the garage is as inviting as a stand-alone garage can be: The circulation areas have walls of rich white ceramic tile, while the corners where elevators are located are skinned in such a way that users can easily see their destination, the hospital to the east.\n\nAs for the skin, it is deep and dense enough to look like something more than a veil across a concrete hulk.\n\nGive the credit to WRNS, which has made a specialty of site-appropriate garages. This is the firm's second in Mission Bay. The first, at 450 South St., has walls of angled white stucco that play up the contrast between shadows and light. It is meant to be viewed all at once, as though it were a billboard-sized canvas; the newcomer eventually will sit behind other buildings on the block, so the fragmented tone makes sense.\n\nThese days, garages have a certain cachet in the world of prestige architecture. One of the most talked-about buildings of 2010 was a Miami garage by Herzog & de Meuron, known here as designers of the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum. The Florida city is also in line for a garage by Zaha Hadid, who not only won the 2004 Pritzker Architecture Prize but has been proclaimed \"the Lady Gaga of Architecture\" by Glamour magazine.\n\nThe difference in San Francisco is that the medical center garage isn't meant to dazzle outsiders. It was done on a design-build basis by WRNS and the construction firm Rudolph and Sletten on a $15.75 million budget. It exists mainly for the use of families visiting their children, as worthy a role as a parking garage can play.\n\nBut a garage, or any other sizable structure, also has a role to play in the larger city. And when you see this one rise to the challenge, you wonder why other buildings in this part of Mission Bay can't strike a wide positive note as well.\n\nJohn King is The San Francisco Chronicle's urban design critic.

Costikyan, the Council's attorney, said that even if the Council's plan was analyzed in light of the new figures, the reapportionment was still fair to black and Hispanic New Yorkers. In almost all districts, however, the revised numbers showed smaller minority populations than did the Council's original estimates.\n\nThe exchange was the latest development in the controversy over whether the Council had discriminated against the city's minorities by creating an insufficient number of districts in which minority candidates would have a chance of being elected. The United States Justice Department is now weighing the legality of the Council's lines.\n\nPart of the difficulty in determining the city's minority population arose because the Census Bureau asked separate questions on respondents' racial background and on whether they were of Hispanic origin. That produced two sets of overlapping numbers. Previously, the only figures available on how Hispanic people described themselves racially were estimates by the Census Bureau that 55.6 percent of Hispanic-Americans described themselves as white. Lower Figures in Boroughs\n\nIn his defense of the plan, Mr. Costikyan argued that since so many Hispanic people called themselves white, the white population figures in each Council district should be reduced and the minority figures increased. He used the 55.6 percent figure as the basis for increasing the minority population.\n\nThe new census figures, however, show that only 44.4 percent of Hispanic New Yorkers said they were white. In Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx -the three boroughs covered by the Federal Voting Rights Act - only 39.9 percent called themselves white.\n\nThese numbers mean that Mr. Costikyan and the Council had reduced the white population in each of the Council districts by too large a number, because they categorized too many Hispanic people as white.\n\n''The numbers game is over,'' said Cesar A. Perales, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is challenging the Council lines. Those in 'Other' Category\n\nBut Mr. Costikyan said that even if one took into account the lower percentage of Hispanic people calling themselves white, the Council had still created nine districts that were more than 65 percent minority and six additional districts more than half minority. However, three of the six districts fell below the 53.5 percent minority population figure that Mr. Costikyan had once said was sufficient for electing a minority Council member.\n\nMr. Costikyan said last night that he had never set an absolute standard and that even without the three seats, the plan still represented ''progress'' for minorities over the old Council lines.\n\nBoth Mr. Perales and Richard Emery, staff counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union, argued that Mr. Costik yan was again overestimating the nonwhite population, this time by adding people who described their race as ''other'' into th e minority category. Many of these people, they said, would turn o ut to be white in a final analysis. But Mr. Costikyan said that h e could not include themas white.\n\nAll the parties expressed fascination over the fact that Hispanic people in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx were much less likely to describe themselves as white than Hispanic people living in Queens or Staten Island.",

He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself.\n\nAfter hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments.\n\nOn one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first.\n\nHe carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet.\n\nHe plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying.\n\nThe device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course.\n\nAt the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree.\n\nHe was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act.\n\nSentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades.\n\nJudge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019\n\nHe warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a \u2018deterrence\u2019 to others.\n\nJudge Burbridge said: \u2018This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence.\u2019\n\nUddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on October 7 last year.\n\nWhen they removed the protective casing from the computers in the bio-science building, the spying devices were discovered.\n\nStaff then began checking other university computer equipment and a further three spying devices were found.\n\nMadhu Rai, prosecuting, said: \u2018It is effectively a case where the defendant has hacked into a number of computers at the university where he was studying for a degree in bio-science.\u2019\n\nMiss Rai said one tracker had been attached to a computer in a \u2018staff only\u2019 area to obtain the password of employee Christine Chapman, who had access to exam grade software.\n\nUddin (police mugshot, left, and outside court, right), who is married, was yesterday jailed for four months after admitting six breaches to the Computer Misuse Act.\n\nBirmingham Crown Court (pictured) heard how Uddin attached a 'shadowing' keyboard device at the back of a number of university computers in order to steal staff passwords.\n\nAn investigation by university staff revealed that Uddin had changed the marks on five pieces of his coursework. His home was searched by police and analysis of his computer revealed that he had carried out searches for keyboard cheating devices on the online marketplace eBay.\n\nBalbir Singh, defending, said Uddin had felt pressure because he was the first person in his family to have gone to university.\n\nAs a result of the need he felt to succeed, \u2018he could not see clearly\u2019, Mr Singh said.\n\nHe added: \u2018It is very unlikely that any other university will touch him after this.

Two civilians died in the crossfire,\" said Ahmed Omar Mohamed, deputy chairman for lower Shabelle region.\n\nAn al Shabaab official who asked not to be named said they exchanged fire with French commandos. \"Three helicopters dropped French commandos. We exchanged fire,\" the official said.\n\n'Inhumane conditions'Allex was one of two officers from his intelligence agency kidnapped by al Shabaab in Mogadishu in July 2009. His colleague, Marc Aubriere, escaped a month later but Allex had been held ever since in what Paris called \"inhumane conditions.\"\n\nThe ministry said he was kidnapped while carrying out an aid mission with the Somali government. France has previously said the two men were in the Somali capital to train local forces.\n\nA video of Allex pleading with Hollande to negotiate his release and save his life appeared on a website in October used by Islamist militant groups around the world. Reuters could not verify its authenticity.\n\nHollande said at the time the government was seeking to start talks with any party able to facilitate Allex's release.\n\nAfter his abduction, al Shabaab issued a series of demands, which included an end to French support for the Somali government and the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers, whose 17,600-strong troops are helping battle the rebels.\n\nUnder pressure from the peacekeeping troops and Somali government forces, al Shabaab has lost many of its major urban strongholds in south-central Somalia since it launched a rebellion against the Western-backed government in 2007.\n\nThe rebels, who want to impose their strict interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, across the Horn of Africa state, withdrew from the capital Mogadishu in August last year and lost their last major bastion of Kismayu six weeks ago.\n\nRead more coverage of Somalia from NBC News",

That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image.\n\n'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.'\n\nMr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services.\n\nThe prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack.\n\nHe believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures.\n\n'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said.\n\nMr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation.\n\nThe prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right)\n\n'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.'\n\nHundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain.\n\nHis comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group.\n\nWaheed Ahmed, 21 \u2013 the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed \u2013 is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS.\n\nAhmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by Turkish police at the border town of Reyhanli last week. He was one of a group of nine detained, all from Rochdale, including four children aged from one to 11.\n\nThey could be flown back to the UK today.\n\nNafir Afzal last month quit the CPS despite being cleared of allegations suggesting he texted a defendant in a case.\n\nIn the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS.\n\nMr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences.\n\nThis included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions.\n\nHe said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice.\n\nMore recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall.\n\nHe also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse.\n\nThe prosecutor last year claimed that there would be a fresh wave of Operation Yewtree arrests concerning the abuse of children by celebrities.\n\nHe said: 'This is a growing industry. There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some are very high-profile figures.'\n\nMr Afzal began his CPS career in central London and went on to be awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 50 words.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\nThe bad news is that Signature Theatre is delaying its move into its new space in the Village at Shirlington almost five months, until early next year, because construction is behind schedule.\n\nThe good news is that because Signature has to juggle its lineup, it has added \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" a musical from producer Cameron Mackintosh that was given a splashy production in London but is being reworked as a more intimate show for Signature.\n\nThe staff at Signature was told this week that its $12.5 million, 45,000-square-foot home would not be ready for a planned opening in September. This isn't the first delay: When the plans for the new theater were announced in 2004, the opening was projected for January 2006.\n\nRight now, construction crews aren't finished and contractors need several months for theater outfitting. After that, the company needs time for rehearsals in a space that will be unfamiliar to the cast and technicians.\n\n\"It is frustrating, but it is not something we can control,\" said Eric Schaeffer, artistic director of the award-winning theater, which has made its mark reworking the catalogue of beloved musicals. \"But a year from now, I bet we will be saying 'What was the big deal?' \"\n\nThe obstacles facing almost all construction projects in the area are also present at Shirlington, said Hunter Moore, a development specialist with Arlington County. Signature's project is a partnership with the county.\n\nShortages of steel, cement and electrical components have caused some of the delays, Moore said. Not only is the building boom in the region a factor, but so are the manpower and resources that were diverted to the Gulf Coast. \"There is over 8 million square feet of construction going on in Arlington right now. Unfortunately, everyone is behind,\" Moore said.\n\nThe county is responsible for construction of the basic building, which the theater will share with a county library. Outfitting two theater spaces, along with rehearsal spaces and offices, is Signature's responsibility. Signature must raise $7 million, and is almost there, according to Signature managers; the county will receive 10 percent of proceeds from ticket sales for the next 30 years as its fee.\n\nThe postponement has caused Signature to rearrange its season. The company decided to open -- almost three weeks late -- on Sept. 26 in its current 136-seat location with the Lerner and Loewe classic \"My Fair Lady.\" Although Signature wanted to present the musical in its new space, it has the rights only until January.\n\nThe first staging in the new space -- with an opening date of Jan. 12, instead of Sept. 5 -- will be Stephen Sondheim's \"Into the Woods.\" \"Witches,\" which Schaeffer directed in its world premiere in London's West End in 2000, will be making its American premiere June 5 to July 15 in the new space.\n\nIn addition, Signature is compressing its entire schedule into a six-month period. \"Crave,\" by Sarah Kane, and \"Susanna Cox,\" by Bathsheba Doran, will be staged in a smaller, 99-seat space of the new complex. The larger theater has 299 seats, and will be the location for \"Hamlet,\" by the Cameri Theatre of Tel Avi; and \"Saving Aimee,\" about evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson.\n\nThe theater was a physical prize for a company, now 17 years old, that has racked up a national reputation for innovative musical theater. Since the 1991-92 season, Signature has won 50 Helen Hayes Awards and 209 Hayes nominations.\n\nThe county recently bought Signature's old headquarters, a former auto-body shop on Four Mile Run, for other cultural organizations. The theater is less than a quarter-mile from Signature's future home.\n\nSignature's managing director, Sam Sweet, said the theater has raised $6.8 million of its $7.6 million capital campaign. He sees the construction delays as an opportunity to lasso in more donors.\n\n\"We now have an opportunity to really impress upon people a sense of urgency, that we really are close,\" Sweet said. \"After we are in on October 16, we have more time to show off the building, have little receptions, have an open house.\"\n\nSpecial correspondent Jane Horwitz contributed to this report.",

Peterman is a Florida-based writer and editor, and the co-creator of the comics blog Girls-Gone-Geek.com.\n\nIn some ways, a local comic shop looks no different from any other store this time of year. Business is up, the halls are decked, and customers new and old are on the hunt for the perfect gifts for loved ones.\n\nBut while any store can put up a Christmas tree and generic holiday decor, some comics shops mark the season with geeky flair.\n\nAt Austin Books & Comics in Austin, Texas, the tree is outfitted with Funco plushies, Dr. Who knicknacks and, of course, a Superman tree-topper. Walk into the Kissimmee, Florida, Coliseum of Comics branch, and you\u2019ll be greeted by a 9-foot fiberglass Red Hulk statue wearing a Santa cap. The Man of Steel is the Christmas tree-topper there as well.\n\nAnother sign of the gifting season at the comics shop? The newbies. Some shop owners and managers say there\u2019s a definite spike in traffic in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and it\u2019s not just the faithful who make the weekly pilgrimage to collect their new books. This time of year, there are more novices coming in to find the right gift for the comic book and gaming lovers in their lives.\n\nA comics veteran can walk into any shop and quickly find his or her way around. But someone entering that world for the first time might feel adrift in a sea of graphic novels and role-playing games. Brandon Zern, general manager of Austin Books & Comics, can usually spot the uninitiated right away.\n\n\u201cWe can tell someone\u2019s been to the shop for the first time because they just kind of look up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to take it all in. They stand there a little bewildered for a moment. We do our best to take away the intimidation.\u201d\n\nColiseum of Comics general manager Brendan Boyle said the photo ops with Hulk are usually a dead giveaway.\n\n\u201cThere will be kind of that look of awe when they come in,\u201d said Boyle. \u201cWhen people come in and they want to take a picture with (the statue), you know they definitely haven\u2019t come in before.\u201d\n\nFortunately, many comic shops operate a bit like specialty boutiques. The person behind the counter is most likely a fan who, with a little information, can guide a first-timer to good holiday gift candidates \u2014 not just comics, but items like collectible action figures and limited edition statuettes.\n\nThe personal factor may be the biggest incentive for newcomers to head to a local comic book shop at Christmastime rather than a big-box store or online, especially if they\u2019re uncertain of what to buy or where to look.\n\n\u201cIf you go to a comic shop, they\u2019re going to be much better at finding something if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Greg Bennett, manager of Big Planet Comics in Washington.\n\nZern said some gift shoppers steer clear of comics altogether, \u201cbecause if they\u2019re not a collector, they don\u2019t really know what their loved one has.\u201d That\u2019s why merchandise such as tumblers, T-shirts and stocking stuffers like spinning Tardises tend to be popular.\n\nIn addition to throwing holiday parties for patrons and holding Black Friday sales, Coliseum Comics offers a \u201cGift Guide for Geeks.\u201d To make it even easier, the store gives regular customers the option of filling out a personal holiday wish list, complete with a small store map for the gift-giver\u2019s benefit.\n\nBoyle said that things were different 15 years ago, when business tended to be slow in October and November and regular customers came in the week after Christmas to spend their holiday cash. But perhaps now that geek culture has gone somewhat mainstream, more members of the general public are testing the waters during the height of the season.\n\n\u201cBeing geeky is kind of cool these days. Pretty much everyone is at least intrigued by what\u2019s going on in the comic book store. They\u2019ve seen the \u2018Big Bang Theory,\u2019\" Boyle said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got a little bit of geek in them.\u201d",

Similarly, I wanted Bill Watterson, of \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d fame, to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nYou think I\u2019m joking.

I hope so. Next month, filmmaker and fan Joel Allen Schroeder will release his tribute movie, \u201cDear Mr. Watterson.\u201d It\u2019s charming, perhaps predictably so. Almost every significant cartoonist in the country salutes Watterson\u2019s \u201cridiculous standard of excellence that hadn\u2019t been seen since the \u2018Pogo\u2019 years,\u201d according to \u201cBloom County\u201d creator Berke Breathed.\n\nWatterson, who has cultivated a reputation as a Pynchon-level recluse, does not appear in the movie.\n\nJust as the movie prepares for release, Watterson\u2019s long-ignored 1990 commencement speech at his alma mater, Kenyon College, has started to go viral on the Internet. The takeaway line: \u201cTo invent your own life\u2019s meaning is not easy, but it\u2019s still allowed, and I think you\u2019ll be happier for the trouble.\u201d And, for one of the very few times in recorded history, the 55-year-old Watterson has granted an interview, which the magazine Mental Floss plans to publish in its December issue.\n\nThe takeaway line: \u201cRepetition is the death of magic.\u201d\n\nOne of my three sons was born during the magical decade of 1985 to 1995, when \u201cCalvin\u201d appeared in the Globe and over 2,000 other newspapers. In part by watching Schroeder\u2019s movie, in part by talking with my peers, I realize that Eric is one of tens of thousands of children who more or less took a pass on elementary school, retreated to their rooms and learned to read, reason, ideate, and enjoy life under Watterson\u2019s tutelage.\n\nEric is a smart fellow. Maybe Bill Watterson should be running America\u2019s grades one through five. He certainly couldn\u2019t do a worse job than the people in charge now.\n\nBill Watterson delivered two great messages to the parents and children of the Reagan and Clinton eras. The first lesson was, at all costs, don\u2019t surrender your imagination. (This is the theme of Jennifer Egan\u2019s fascinating 2006 novel \u201cThe Keep.\u201d) Watterson\u2019s strips, all 3,000-plus of them, celebrate the powerfully imagined world of childhood, where a cardboard box functions as a time machine and the neighbors\u2019 back yard becomes a craggy, unexplored planet. And where imaginary friends can be the best friends, as they so often are.\n\nWatterson\u2019s second message, which now seems vestigial, was: Let childhood be childhood. Calvin\u2019s school had a bully, the notorious Moe. (\u201cYou\u2019re gonna taste asphalt fifth period, Twinky. Just so ya know.\u201d) Calvin sometimes expressed affection for his on-again, off-again love interest Suzie by throwing snowballs at her, often hard. (\u201cPow!\u201d)\n\nIn our day, it is all too easy to imagine a hypothetical Brookline Parents Coalition Against Bullying and Child-on-Child Violence petitioning to close the strip down.\n\nWatterson taught us all another lesson: Money isn\u2019t everything. At various times, Steven Spielberg, Pixar, and plush toy giant Dakin begged Watterson\u2019s to follow \u201cGarfield\u201d creator Jim Davis down the gilded road to franchising hell. (In Schroeder\u2019s movie, one interviewee calls Garfield merchandise \u201ca national blight.\u201d) Watterson wanted no part of it. His cartoon syndicate thinks he may have left $400 million on the table. He couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nIf I could say two words to Bill Watterson, they would not be \u201ccome back.\u201d To have succeeded magnificently, on your own terms, and not lingered to watch the energy drain from your creation \u2014 what an accomplishment. I would say, \u201cthank you.\u201d I am sure he\u2019s heard those words before, but they bear repeating.",

Are we experiencing a Calvin and Hobbes moment? I hope so. Next month, filmmaker and fan Joel Allen Schroeder will release his tribute movie, \u201cDear Mr. Watterson.\u201d around the country. It\u2019s charming, perhaps predictably so. Almost every significant cartoonist in the country salutes Watterson\u2019s \u201cridiculous standard of excellence that hadn\u2019t been seen since the \u2018Pogo\u2019 years,\u201d according to \u201cBloom County\u201d creator Berke Breathed."

I go back to that Super Bowl two years ago, and that\u2019s when my analysis that Peyton was done started. And nobody wanted to hear it. Listen, there are very few players I have more respect for than Peyton because of his mental prowess. But the inability for Peyton to throw outside the numbers and deep consistently now for two years has been on tape if anyone wanted to see it. The good defensive coaches have taken away the middle of the field, and that\u2019s why he struggled to begin the year. So we\u2019ll see, but I\u2019d love for the Sheriff to get one more.\n\nQ: Let\u2019s get your quick thoughts on Chip Kelly. You were openly critical of the 49ers hiring Chip Kelly. Tell us what you don\u2019t like about the fit.\n\nA: The Philly fans hated me three years ago. Even after (the Eagles) won 10 games and won the division, I said, \u201cTrust me, guys, this is an elementary offense and it\u2019s not going to last. The league is going to catch up to it and eat it up.\u201d And you\u2019ve seen it every year, the numbers go down, down and down. There\u2019s no red zone intuition. There\u2019s no run game intuition when they\u2019ve got to have it. And the offensive system is elementary. The base thought process that he\u2019s trying to create on most plays isn\u2019t going to work with good defenses in our league. I feel bad for NaVorro (Bowman) and those guys on defense because this defense was trapped on the field last year for 34, 35 minutes. Ask that Philly defense. They were far more talented than this Niners defense right now and they were trapped on the field for 34, 35 minutes last year.\n\nQ: He thinks you can make up for that by wearing down the other team\u2019s defense by playing at a high tempo.\n\nA: This isn\u2019t college. And, heck, it didn\u2019t work in college. Did he ever get to the top of the mountain?\n\nQ: Well, he was 44-7 in college and (Oregon) became a national power.\n\nA: Well, what happened every time he faced a tougher, better-coached team? They got humiliated.\n\nQ: (In Philadelphia wasn\u2019t) the issue that Chip Kelly the GM let down Chip Kelly the coach?\n\nA: No. His offense just doesn\u2019t work. Who cares what happens from 20 (yard line) to 20 (yard line)? Can you score against the good teams? And the answer is \u201cno.\u201d And can your quarterback and your system make things work when it counts? And the answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\nQ: Is there a quarterback on the roster, in the draft or in free agency that Chip will go with?\n\nA: No. There are only three players that are smart enough to make this offense work with the time restraints he puts on his quarterback: Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers. And even if you have these guys playing quarterback, you still wouldn\u2019t hoist the Lombardi because the offense is so elementary.",

You won\u2019t have to fork out for an expensive gym membership you\u2019ll never use.\n\nYou can do these mini workouts in the breaks of your favourite TV shows and all you\u2019ll need is two bottles of water.\n\nCalum says: \u201cThese are easy exercises you can do anywhere\u201d and you can either work out alongside his video, or by yourself if you\u2019d prefer.\n\nForget running on a treadmill for half an hour, Calum\u2019s sets are fun, different, and will help fight the flab in time for a beach-ready body.\n\nYou\u2019ll start with a five minute warm up using water bottles to elevate your heartrate. Calum adds that the short intervals of exercise will leave your \u201cblood flow shooting round the body\u201d, helping you feel pumped and energised.\n\nAfter the warm up, you\u2019ll do what Calum calls \u201cdynamic stretching\u201d.

If that case succeeds, low- and middle-income people in those states will have to pay a lot more of their insurance premiums.\n\nThe new suit, filed late last month by the Republican-dominated House, aims to block another important subsidy: federal payments to insurance companies to keep deductibles, co-payments and other cost-sharing low for the poor. The Affordable Care Act specifies the maximum amounts people will have to pay in cost-sharing based on their incomes, and federal subsidies make up the rest.\n\nIf the government is blocked from reimbursing insurers for the subsidies, the insurers will have to absorb the costs. But companies might well raise their premiums for everyone else in the individual market to recoup the loss. The House lawsuit argues that no money was appropriated to reimburse insurers for cost-sharing and that the administration could not use money from a separate account that subsidizes premiums.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act authorized these cost-sharing subsidies when it was enacted in 2010 and the administration at one point requested an appropriation, but Congress failed to provide it. The House suit argues that it was unconstitutional for the administration to tap the separate fund to pay cost-sharing subsidies that are expected to total $175 billion over a 10-year period.\n\nFor the suit to proceed, the House must show that it has standing to challenge the administration\u2019s action. Courts often shy away from disputes between Congress and the executive branch. This suit does not even reflect the will of Congress, since it was filed only by the House, not the whole Congress.\n\nThe House will have to prove that it was injured by the administration\u2019s action and that the injury can be best fixed by the courts rather than by political means. If the courts grant standing, the House will have the additional burden of proving that a specific appropriation for this subsidy is actually required. If the House Republicans prevail and no law appropriating money is enacted, the harm may be significant. Many, if not most, of the people enrolled in health plans on the exchanges are believed to receive cost-sharing subsidies from insurers. If the federal government cannot assist, a lot of other individual policyholders may have to pay more.\n\nA version of this editorial appears in print on December 13, 2014, on page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Another Baseless Attack on Health Law.

To be more precise, I wrote the piece because the response \u2013 the angry response \u2013 to the minister's speech had so annoyed me. (The fake outrage which greets any commonplace assertion made by any government minister about anything is one of the reasons we get the politicians we deserve: we refuse to permit them to speak like human beings.) The irritation was compounded in this case by its all-too-typical source: a lobby group. The Child Poverty Action Group criticised Anna Soubry for mentioning the dietary habits of the overweight, and went further, using that liberal standard de nos jours, \"the evidence\", to attack the minister. Their head of policy said:\n\nRather than blaming parents, ministers should look at the piles of evidence that make it absolutely clear that the real reason why our obesity problem is going to get bigger in the years ahead is because our child poverty problem is going to get much bigger as a result of the Government\u2019s own policies.\n\nAh, \"the evidence\", the mere existence of which is held by people, generally untrained in the logic of induction, to claim that their political theory is more or less proven; henceforth any opponent is essentially irrational. Here, \"the evidence\" is being used in the way most favoured by lobby groups (listen to \"Today\" and count the times \"the evidence\" is cited by someone who wants more of your money): the \"evidence\" linking poverty to obesity is so strong, and the Government is actively making the poor poorer [so runs CPAG's argument], that the minister is effectively forcing poor people to be fat.\n\nExcept she isn't. What's this, in yesterday's paper?\n\nResearchers found 11 and 12-year-olds who lived in areas of Leeds dominated by middle-income families had a greater chance of being obese than those who lived in poorer or richer areas.\n\nThis \"evidence\" is based on more than 10,000 children. So presumably there will be press releases from the Child Poverty Action Group, congratulating the government? Since CPAG believe that government policy is to make us more poor, and now \"the evidence\" conclusively demonstrates that the more poor one becomes, the less fat one will be \u2013 in direct opposition to the assertion made two weeks ago by CPAG \u2013 surely the only rational response will be for them to praise Ms Soubry's administration?\n\nDon't hold your breath. When the facts change, I change my mind; but when the evidence changes, lobby groups just find another spurious reason to argue that we'll all go to hell in a handcart \u2013 unless they get their hands on your money. There's plenty of evidence for that.\n\n(PS If you're interested: the historical process by which statistical observations grow into natural, or at least political, laws is a fascinating topic, addressed in this wonderful book by Ian Hacking, The Taming of Chance.)",

Instead these bears are eating lots of meat this time of year.\u201d\n\nThe project, called \u201cA Bear\u2019s Eye View: A Day in the Life of a Bear\u201d can be seen on the ADF&G website.\n\nAccording to the ADF&G website, the bear in this particular video is called Boar 6041, and is a 10-year-old male brown bear in the Copper River Basin of South Central Alaska.\n\nSome highlights of the video are listed on the ADF&G website:\n\n3:32 a.m. he\u2019s breeding with a female bear, and at 4:02 there\u2019s a good view of her ear and head. Later in the day he\u2019ll mate again with a different female.\n\n4:47 is breakfast time. He\u2019s eating a pile of fish by a lake, presumably winter-killed. Another short clip (also available for viewing as part of this collection) made a day earlier shows him eating from this same pile of fish, so it seems he found this resource earlier, ate some, and has returned.\n\n5:02 he\u2019s pawing at the water, perhaps pulling some submerged fish carcasses up to shore. He then goes back to eating the beached fish. He\u2019s still eating fish at 5:17, but then lays down for a rest.",

The headline reads: \u201cTreasury calls in Cable for talks on a hung parliament\u201d, and the story reveals that Vince Cable is \u201cready to serve\u201d as Chancellor. Mr Cable claims the Treasury and its permanent secretary Sir Nicholas Macpherson are now \u201ctaking seriously\u201d what the Lib Dems have to say and wanted to hear what Mr Cable would do if he was invited to fill his own red box. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say to me \u2018yes minister but you can\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d he\u2019s quoted as saying. Mr Cable has quite cleverly given the impression that the Treasury, impressed by his dominance of the economic scene, has set a new convention (he claims, slyly, that he was unaware of such meetings happening before) by inviting the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman in to hear his views. If true, that would be quite a turn up for the books. If true.\n\nExcept it\u2019s not. It turns out the meeting was his idea, he asked for it, and it was granted out of courtesy. And it lasted 20 minutes. So, far from being summoned in for detailed talks, he invited himself in and was given a polite hearing. The Treasury, fair to say, is shaking its head in rueful admiration at Mr Cable\u2019s chutzpah: \u201cExtraordinary what he made of a 20 minute meeting set up at his request.\u201d In fairness to him, he doesn\u2019t appear to have claimed it was a Treasury invite, but presented with a chance, he\u2019s grabbed it. Of course, what he\u2019s also done is locked himself in to the age of austerity and cuts. Weeks from now, if he gets his wish, he will be presiding over a programme of eye-watering retrenchment that will make the Lib Dems weep. Be careful what you wish for etc.",

In \u201cBeauty,\u201d Sorrentino\u2019s celebrity journalist Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo) has grown more famous than those he interviews. He has achieved legendary status, becoming an arbiter of taste who throws parties so exclusive and hip that even the pope is tempted to attend them. Yet Jep, too, is filled with ennui and self-loathing. In other words, the values of pop culture may have evolved, but ennui and self-loathing remain the same. As for the differences between Fellini and Sorrentino as filmmakers, the less said the better.\n\nTo Sorrentino\u2019s credit, the first five minutes of the film suggest otherwise, combining elements of Fellini with \u201cLast Year at Marienbad\u201d (1961) and a hint of Luis Bu\u00f1uel. After a grim epigraph from Louis-Ferdinand Celine to the effect that everything is delusion and pain, the film hovers about Rome\u2019s Fontana dell\u2019Acqua Paola, where black-clad women in a marble niche sing something by Henryk G\u00f3recki. A middle-aged Japanese tourist smiles, takes a snapshot, and drops dead. This montage is cryptic, beguiling, edited with startling juxtapositions, and best of all, it doesn\u2019t have much to do with what follows, an episodic tour of Jep\u2019s banal reflections on his life.\n\nJep, it turns out, wasn\u2019t always such a cynical sad sack. Back in the day, some 40 years before, he wrote his first and only novel, \u201cThe Human Apparatus,\u201d regarded by some as a masterpiece. Then the good life seduced him and he started staying up all night and decided he wanted to be the king of high society. This he has achieved, but while celebrating his 65th birthday party in a typically decadent bash, with dancing, debauchery and backstabbing, he wonders if this is what he really wanted after all. He is at heart a serious writer, someone who likes \u201cthe smell of old people\u2019s houses.\u201d\n\nWell, to each his own. Judging from the quality of his prose, which Jep intones at times in voice-over, he probably made the right choice after all. For the rest of the movie, in lieu of writing his next great novel, Jep wanders Rome gazing at beautifully shot nudes, sculptures, and ruins with an expression of knowing melancholy and Olympian detachment. Or he lounges at soirees and acts like a pompous boor, insulting women, exposing phonies, and waxing eloquent about life, transience, and the irony of it all. Cigarette in hand, his face reflecting sentimentality and arrogance, he has all the flaws, but none of the beauty of his counterpart in \u201cLa Dolce Vita.\u201d",

                    "content": "Summarize the following document in exactly 100 words.\n\n[DOCUMENT]\n\u2018Somewhere Between\u201d opens with a familiar scene: We\u2019re in a hotel room in China, where a baby is meeting her adoptive parents for the first time. The baby is crying; her new mother is, too. They\u2019re about to go on a remarkable journey together. But we\u2019re not going with them.\n\nInstead, the mother, Linda Goldstein Knowlton, explains that she\u2019s made this film as a gift to the baby, whom she names Ruby. Knowlton\u2019s idea involves documenting the lives of four teenagers who also came from China to live in the United States. To help Ruby face a future built on an incomplete past, Knowlton says, she has to \u201cmeet the girls who have already walked in her shoes.\u201d\n\nSo, that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. To meet Fang \u201cJenni\u201d Lee who\u2019s about to turn 15 in Berkeley, Calif., and Jenna Cook (also 15) in Newburyport, and Ann Boccuti (14) in Lansdale, Pa., and Haley Butler (13) in Nashville. Their stories will offer a small window on the lives of some 80,000 Chinese adoptees now living in the United States. If you don\u2019t expect more than that from this movie you\u2019ll be impressed, and likely moved to tears, by its star quartet of delightful, articulate, remarkably regular teens. If you come looking for a broad understanding of international adoption and the policies of China or any other country, however, you\u2019ll still have to hit the Internet when you get home.\n\nI prefer to appreciate \u201cSomewhere Between\u201d for what it is (important filmmaking), rather than bemoan what it isn\u2019t (great filmmaking). Knowlton has landed on four stories that deserve to be told, and she\u2019s told them in a straightforward way that gets the job done, with obvious dedication and love. Fang, who seems much older than 15 (and could well be, given the often imprecise assignment of foundlings\u2019 ages), poignantly recalls her birth mother\u2019s gray braid and the poor, rural village she lived in before being abandoned and adopted at 5. She visits China regularly now, to lend support to its orphanages and to see if anyone can pinpoint her own ethnic heritage.\n\nJenna attends Phillips Exeter Academy and struggles with perfectionism that she thinks springs from being cast off at such an early age. Ann marches in her high school\u2019s color guard \u2014 a \u201creject sport\u201d for people who \u201cdon\u2019t fit in,\u201d she says. She\u2019s not so interested in unearthing her Chinese roots. At least, not yet.\n\nThen there\u2019s Haley. She\u2019s a violinist and singer who hopes one day to make history on the Grand Ole Opry stage. In the meantime, she decides to go looking for her birth parents in China. What she finds is a part of her past that she never expected would be so easy to reclaim. These scenes are extraordinary. If you don\u2019t weep, you should be checked to see if you\u2019re a stone Buddha.\n\nAll the girls in this film speak candidly. Sometimes their words sound like poetry. Sometimes their words are poetry. And sometimes they\u2019re reminders that adoption isn\u2019t always neat and pretty, as when adoptees talk about where they were \u201cdumped\u201d or how they endure the \u201cstupid stuff\u201d that people sometimes say. One girl jovially embraces the label of banana (yellow on the outside, white on the inside), and another says with a nervous smile that she\u2019s maybe more like a scrambled egg. United Adoptees International founder Hilbrand Westra, a vocal critic of transracial adoptions, also makes a brief appearance.\n\nAt one point, Fang casually admits that she\u2019s confused about her identity and feels as much like a foreigner in America as she does in China. Neither here nor there in terms of belonging, she\u2019s \u201ca child stuck between two countries.\u201d She says this without self-pity or blame or even resignation. She seems to know already that, whether or not she ever finds her exact place in the world, she\u2019s more than capable of making a mark. The great gift that Knowlton has given to her daughter, and all others like her, is proof that she\u2019s far from alone.\n\nThe director and stars of the film will make several appearances at the Kendall Square Cinema to answer questions. On Friday Knowlton will attend the 4:25 p.m. screening. She will be joined by several of the film\u2019s subjects at that evening\u2019s 7 p.m. show, and on Saturday for shows at 1:30, 4:25, 7, and 9:35 p.m.",

In the letter below, dated early November 1934, she wrote to her suitor: \"Everybody is so constantly urging me to 'wait two or three months,' 'wait-wait,' 'two months isn't long enough to have known the man you're to marry.' \"\n\nMuch of their courting took place via mail, as LBJ was in Washington working as a congressional aide, while Lady Bird remained in her hometown (Karnack, Texas). LBJ's letters were honest and surprisingly sentimental. On Oct. 24, 1934, he wrote to her:\n\nHave been intending to tell you everyday about a little orange comb I carry in my billfold. It is the only thing I have from my little girl at Karnack and when I get lonesome and blue or happy and ambitious I always get pleasure when I look at the little comb and think . . . just think.\n\nThe LBJ Library has just opened a new Web exhibit where you can read more courtship letters between the two Texans.\n\n[November 8 or 9, 1934 ?]\n\nI wish I could put all the warmth and love into those words I feel. It was good to hear your voice \u2014 its so strong and re-assuring and vital, darling.\n\nWhen I got home I showed Dad my ring and last night we had a long talk about us. He was very sorry you left so soon \u2014 but I told him how it was. He was afraid you found our house too rough and inconvenient \u2014 which it is, what with no nice bath room and no attractive furnishings ( \u2014 all that was our plan for me to do this winter.) Dad said he would have liked to talk to you some more. He thinks you are fine, Lyndon. He said, \"He looks perfect physically and that counts a lot, honey.\" (Fancy his having thought of that!) And he thinks you are going far, and that you love me, and that you'll be good to me. But even he is a little grave about it being so soon.\n\nDarling, darling the reason I talk and act the way I do is because everybody is so constantly urging me to \"wait two or three months,\" \"wait-wait,\" \"two months isn't long enough to have known the man you're to marry,\" \"if he loves you he'll wait for you\" \u2014 and so on until my head aches. By all these \"everybody\" I mean Dorris and Cousin Trenna Mae and Aunt Effie (I've already talked to her by phone) and all the people who've known me since I was born and loved me so much. O my dearest, please don't blame them \u2014 they can't help it. It Its [sic] only because they love me and they want to be very deliberate about it. Do you hate me for being not entirely un-moved by them? Don't \u2014 Lyndon, please.\n\nTranscript prepared by LBJ Library staff, January 2013\n\nOnion contributes to Slate's history blog, The Vault.",

University officials have asked for that data, but those requests have not been met.\"\n\nAs well as questioning UNC many times about the story before publication, CNN has also detailed Willingham's research.\n\nAnd purported e-mail exchanges obtained by CNN since August show that Willingham did share her findings at least twice -- once with Executive Vice Provost James W. Dean Jr., and once with a member of a university committee on academics and athletics.\n\nIn addition, Willingham says her research on the students in the athletics programs that make money for the university was done based on screenings that the university itself paid for. And, she says, she has gotten permission from the university several times since 2008 to access those findings to continue her research.\n\n\"It's already available to them,\" Willingham said. \"It's in their system. ... They have all the data and more. It belongs to them, and they paid a lot of money for it.\"\n\nWomen who blew whistle and what happened next\n\nLast year, when CNN asked UNC for comment on Willingham's research, officials initially denied knowing about it, and said: \"Such analysis is not part of her job duties at the university.\"\n\nThen, after being shown the e-mails, a spokesperson admitted that Willingham did share her findings and did have permission from the university to do the research in the first place, and said a meeting with Willingham was being scheduled.\n\nApart from Wednesday's statement, UNC has not responded to CNN's request for an explanation.\n\nIn the meantime, Willingham said she has heard from one branch of the university -- the Department of Public Safety.\n\nSince CNN's report, Willingham said she's gotten four death threats, and more than 30 other alarming messages.\n\n\"Not people who disagree, people who put in the subject or body (of the e-mail) straight-up hate speech,\" she said.\n\nBut there have also been notes of support from several other academic advisers around the country, Willingham says, and they make it worth the trouble.\n\n\"I've been getting more and more nice notes from high school teachers and literacy specialists across the country saying 'Thank you.'\"\n\nA formal incident report hasn't been made yet, but university police said: \"We are looking into it and making effort to reach out and investigate the nature of the threats.\"\n\n\"It's really OK,\" Willingham said of the threats, \"because I'm telling the truth.\"",

Wangensteen, a pioneer in various types of surgery who trained generations of other surgeons, died yesterday of a heart attack at his home in Minneapolis. He was 82 years old.\n\nFor 37 years, Dr. Wangensteen was chief of surgery at the University of Minnesota. Medical students from all over the world were attracted to the department because of his strong emphasis on research and laboratory experiment. Dr. Christaan N. Barnard, of Capetown, South Africa, and Dr. Norman E. Shumway, of Stanford University, who performed the first human heart transplants, are among his former students, as are professors of surgery at more than 30 institutions in the United States and abroad.\n\nUnder Dr. Wangensteen's leadership, University of Minnesota surgeons played leading roles in pioneering open-heart surgery in the 1950's.\n\nDr. Wangensteen made important contributions to cancer surgery and to the understanding of appendicitis and other disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. In the 1930's, to combat intestinal obstructions, which frequently killed patients after surgery, he developed a suction tube technique named for him and used in hospitals around the world. He also developed procedures for the treatment of gastric cancer and ulcers. Teaching Methods Praised\n\nAfter Dr. Barnard began his revolutionary heart transplant operations in the late 1960's, an article in Business Week magazine traced the roots of the surgical technique back to Dr. Wangensteen's laboratories and teaching methods at the University of Minnesota. The university's department of surgery ''grew up around Wangensteen like a mushroom in the middle of the prairie,'' the article said, adding that ''the Wangensteen approach is leading to miracles of surgery.''\n\nIn addition to stressing the importance of research and the study of science for surgeons, Dr. Wangensteen also said, ''The future of medicine and surgery demands that while we strive to improve the sciences of our craft, we do not neglect the compassionate graces of sympathy, mercy and charity.''\n\nCalled ''the chief'' by his students and colleagues, Dr. Wangensteen often began his day at 3:30 A.M., reading at his desk for several hours before a day of surgery and teaching.\n\nEven after he retired in 1967, he continued to be active. With his wife, Sarah, a medical historian, he wrote ''The Rise of Surgery, from Empiric Craft to Scientific Discipline.'' The book was published in 1979 by the University of Minnesota Press and was praised by reviewers in medical journals as ''good reading'' as well as a good reference book. He was at work on another book at the time of his death. Grew Up on a Farm\n\nDr. Wangensteen was born Sept. 21, 1898, in Lake Park, Minn., and grew up on a farm there. ''I didn't even want to be a doctor,'' he once said. ''I loved animals. Of three boys, I was the one interested in farming.''\n\nAt the insistence of his father, he agreed to study medicine. He finished at the top of his class at the University of Minnesota Medical School, graduating in 1922. Later, he studied at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where he earned a Ph.D. degree in 1925. He became an instructor at the University of Minnesota in 1926 and four years later, at the age of 31, became the chief of surgery.\n\nIn 1972, Dr. Wangensteen helped establish the university's Wangensteen Historial Library of Biology and Medicine, which includes more than 25,000 volumes, some dating back to the 15th century. In 1979, the university dedicated the Phillips-Wangensteen building, a 16-level addition to its health-science complex, to Dr. Wangensteen and Jay Phillips, the Minneapolis philanthropist.\n\nDr. Wangensteen was formerly president of the American College of Surgeons, the American Surgical Association and the American chapter of the International Surgical Society. He was an honorary member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He was honored with citations from the Sorbonne and the Norwegian Academy of Science, and received the distinguished service award of the American Medical Association.\n\nHe is survived by his wife; two sons, Dr. Stephen L. of Tucson, Ariz., and Owen G. of Spain, and a daughter, Mary Brink, of Wayzata, Minn.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Dr. Wangensteen",

If you got a bit of cardboard and bent it to a curve, it would wrinkle and look ugly - and that's precisely the effect created here. You can imagine the architects and planners saying: \"Curved buildings are really sexy - let's make one, but really cheaply.\" The detailing looks like something a primary school would come up with - rather tragic given that this country was responsible for the arts and crafts movement, which created buildings with the resources available and detailed them with humanity. This is the architectural equivalent of someone scratching a blackboard with their fingernails. It's like one of the worst Changing Room makeovers ever. What worries me is the taste-free dullards who have bought apartments here. I'd rather see the Elephant and Castle shopping centre preserved for posterity.\n\nThe Royal Naval College at Greenwich, by contrast, is all about detailing and humanity. Everything seems to be at eye level; it's not patronising or distant in the way that Parliament View is. Every last detail is considered. There are buildings that sex me up more, but it is the most important building in London for me, the reason I moved to Greenwich. It says something, I think, about British democracy that this is the only true palace in London, and was ultimately used not by the royal family, but as a hospital for distressed and diseased seamen. It wasn't really finished until the 19th century, and you can see the handwriting of so many great British architects on it: Wren, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh. It's emblematic of the best of British architecture, which grows and develops over time.\n\n\u00b7 Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen gives a talk at the Greenwich Royal Naval College, London SE10, tomorrow, as part of Architecture Week.

Last week the charade players acted out in seconds such terms as ''supply-side economics,'' ''individual retirement accounts'' and ''Office of Management and Budget.''\n\nMost of them had little trouble identifying the voices of Edwin Meese 3d, Donald T. Regan and John McEnroe from tapes of National Public Radio broadcasts, and they quickly recognized newspaper and magazine pictures of Pope John Paul II in a T-shirt, his face covered with shaving lather, of Lyn Nofziger in a Santa Claus suit and of Princess Caroline of Monaco sunning in the buff. In fact, out of the 20 photographs, only one stumped these Washington observers. None of them recognized a perfectly clear picture of Malcolm Baldrige, the Secretary of Commerce.\n\nW HEN the Center for Democratic Policy was formed last year to counter the intellectual force of Republican public policy groups, some Democrats warned that its name would lead to confusion about its nature and purpose. But even those prophets underestimated the confusion the name would bring. People immediately assumed that the new public policy research organization was an arm of the Democratic Party, which it is not, or a political action committee, which it is not. Even worse, it began receiving mail addressed to the National Democratic Policy Committee, a group headed by Lyndon H. LaRouche, who ran for President in 1980 on the Labor Party ticket. Now comes w ord that the Center for Democratic Policy is changing its name. Her eafter, it will be known as the Center for National Policy. Unfor tunately, the name change comes a few days before a separate grou p of liberal Democrats is to announce the birth of another publi c policy organization, this one calling itself the National Poli cy Exchange. Or is it the Center for National Policy Exchange, or the Exchange for National Democratic Policy? Is the Postal Servic e up to the challenge?\n\nT HE food industry, consumer groups and Government agencies have formed The Network for Better Nutrition to promote sound nutritional principles. At least that is the best guess of what the group will be up to.\n\nThe release announcing the birth of this new diet watchdog is almost indigestible. Among other things, it said that the outfit, with equal representation of consumer advocates and food industry officials, ''will develop a capacity to access documentation related to priority themes and identify areas for additional investigation and consensus building.''\n\nThe gobbledygook aside, it is remarkable that these groups, which generally give one another heartburn, will be working together: General Foods and the Consumer Federation of America, Quaker Oats and the Federal Trade Commission, Safeway Stores and the Society for Nutrition Education, to name a few.

We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\"\n\nThe thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air.\n\nMusic resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n\nOther performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour.\n\nArcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.\n\nBravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.\n\nThey  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs.\n\nAs well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.\n\nFrontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance.\n\nThe set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).\n\nThe group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.\n\nPlus, they have really catchy choruses.\n\nThe band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.\n\nAs the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage.\n\n\"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\"\n\nThe feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday.\n\n\"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a nice vibe. There's lots of families.\n\n\"It's not just about massive headlining acts. And it's not going to be a swamp of corporate beer-swilling drunkards.\n\n\"There's rain and there's mud but it's new and it doesn't smell bad yet. It's like, 'oh, this mud smells like grass! It's spring!'\"\n\nThe music continues on Saturday with Jake Bugg, Pixies, Clean Bandit and Manic Street Preachers on the bill.\n\nAmong those watching the action will be Hollywood star Bradley Cooper, who told the BBC: \"I'm excited to see Metallica and I want to see Jack White and Lana Del Rey.\"\n\nAsked if he was put off by the weather, the Hangover star replied: \"I love it.

D. James Kennedy, the pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a leading figure in the recent drive by conservative church groups to help elect candidates who espoused views that agreed with fundamentalist moral principles.\n\nMr. Kennedy also serves on the board of the Round Table, an umbrella group for religiously conservative activists. He told 2,000 delegates at a joint meeting of National Religious Broadcasters and the National Association of Evangelicals that evangelicals should increase their level of political involvement because ''secular humanists have declared war on Christianity in this country and they are progressing very rapidly.''\n\nDeclaring that the public had been largely ''brainwashed'' into believing that the Constitution placed restrictions on churchconnected political activity, Mr. Kennedy asked: ''What does it really say about what the church can do and can't do? Absolutely nothing.''\n\nTurning to the subject of secular humanism, a term often used to define a viewpoint that disregards religion as a factor in solving human problems, Mr. Kennedy linked its alleged rise to growing atheism and moral laxity on issues such as abortion, homosexuality and pornography.\n\nAs the political wave among conservative Christians has grown, secular humanism has been blamed for a variety of social and moral ills and represents the main focus of the conservative attack.\n\nThe activism by Christian political groups was considered a significant factor in the election of many conservative candidates, including President Reagan, who seemed to reflect fundamentalist opposition to abortion, civil rights for homosexuals and the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as their backing of prayer in the public schools.\n\nBut appeals for evangelical support for this activist movement have met mixed reactions among conservative church people. The tensions among the various segments of conservative Christianity have been apparent in the early stages of the joint four-day meeting at the Sheraton Washington Hotel. Divergence Among Evangelicals\n\nThe frictions are mirrored in the two organizations, which represent different constituencies and, to a large degree, distinct points of view on the question.\n\nThe National Association of Evangelicals, the older group, founded in 1941, is composed of 36,000 member congregations from a wide variety of evangelical denominations.\n\nIt reflects many of the moderate theological and moral views that tend to include distrust of single-issue politics, and it often criticizes the tendency of the new Christian right to identify certain political positions as being the only ones authenticated by the Bible. Many in this group also complain of the attempt to form what they see as a quasi political Christian party.\n\nMarlin Van Elderen, a leading evangelical, underscored this criticism in an article in United Evangelical Action, the official publication of the N.A.E.\n\nAmong the dangers of the activism. Mr. Van Elderen said, is ''enshrining one's own particular political and ethical judgments as the biblical viewpoint.\n\n''No person or organization - not the World Council of Churches nor the National Association of Evangelicals, not Jerry Falwell nor Pope John Paul II -speaks on behalf of biblical Christianity in matters social and political,'' he wrote. Criticism of Braodcasters\n\nThe disagreements are accompanied by attacks on evangelical broadcasters. The National Religious Broadcasters, begun under the auspices of the N.A.E. in 1943 as a special interest group, has in many ways overshadowed its parent. This rivalry is intensified by the widespread suspicion that media evangelists are causing neglect of local churches by siphoning away members and money.\n\nAttacks on evangelical broadcasters came from two sources today. George Sweeting, president of the Moody Bible Institute, warned that the ''parachurch movement,'' which includes a broad scope of evangelical efforts beyond the local church, among them television and radio ministries, threatens to become the ''tail that wags the dog.'' He appealed for a ''recovery of the centrality of the local church.''\n\nMr. Sweeting also criticized television evangelism for running the risks of ''extravagant spending and an elegant lifestyle,'' resorting to ''unwise methods of fund-raising ... substituting entertainment for the word of God'' and ''adding our own culture to the Gospel.''",

The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",

The fact that this is a tradition is not a defence to the people involved,\u201d Ashton said.\n\nMartin\u2019s lawyers Dino Michaels and Richard Escobar accepted that Champion suffered a severe beating and that his death was due to \u201chaemorrhagic shock\u201d caused by massive internal bleeding, but argued that he was a willing participant in a what was effectively a competition of strength.\n\n\u201cBrutal as it was, foolish as it was, it was competitive,\u201d Escobar told the jury.\n\nMartin, who did not testify during the trial, was one of 15 band members ultimately charged after the investigation into Champion\u2019s death. Nine have received probation or community service, one was cleared and another, Jessie Baskin, 22, received an 11-month prison sentence after pleading no contest to manslaughter in March.\n\nProceedings against the remaining three \u2013 Benjamin McNamee, Aaron Golson and Darryl Cearnell \u2013 who were due to stand trial at the same time as Martin, were postponed to a future date by circuit court judge Renee Roche.\n\nKeon Hollis, Champion\u2019s roommate on the band\u2019s trip from Tallahassee to Orlando to play at the university\u2019s football game in the city, testified that he had also collapsed after being beaten while passing through the bus, and that the ritual that he said probably took only seconds \u201cseemed to last forever.\u201d\n\nAn investigation by university authorities revealed that such hazing rituals were commonplace. Julian White, the band\u2019s director, resigned after several months of trying to save his job and Dr James Ammons, the Famu president, stood down in July 2012 following criticism over his handling of the scandal.\n\nThe nationally acclaimed band, which had played at a Super Bowl and at Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration, returned to competition last year after a 21-month suspension.\n\nIn closing arguments, Ashton had told the jury that attitudes towards hazing needed to change.\n\n\u201cThe last decision [Champion] made in life is an example of peer pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an example that even the best are subject to the desire to be accepted by their peers. It is an example of what happens when decades of indifference and decades of fantasy lead us to ignore the law.\u201d\n\nChampion\u2019s parents have set up a foundation in their son\u2019s name dedicated to eliminating hazing in universities, colleges and schools, and have also filed a wrongful death suit against the university, which they say allowed hazing to carry on unchecked.\n\nMrs Champion said the word \u201ckind of puts a powder puff on things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you go out and beat a person to death, you beat them until they die, it\u2019s murder,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you turn around and put the word hazing on top of it, then what is it? It becomes nothing. And that\u2019s what is wrong.\u201d",

Thom Yorke's does so with a vengeance.\n\nOn \"The Eraser,\" the front man's first album away from his band Radiohead, the riffs don't thrash, the beats won't pound, and the singer never screams.\n\nInstead, everything goes for intimacy, from small, shuddering synthesizers to tiny dabs of bass to a plethora of percussion devices, each content to simply click and clack away.\n\nSometimes the beat seems as sheer as the sound of a katydid rubbing its legs together, or a clock numbly ticking down the time.\n\nIt's a minimalist, and miniaturized, approach. It's also one that can end up sounding borderline adorable. But the result has more urgency than anything the too-arty-for-its-own-good Radiohead has released in eons.\n\nPart of this has to do with the fact that we bring different expectations to a scaled-down project like this. No one's looking for the range or brilliance of the main band's masterpiece (\"OK Computer\"). But what really makes Yorke's album work is how he grounds his album's grander intentions.\n\nFor one thing, he put his voice higher in the mix than usual. It sounds like he's transmitting every line directly into your ear, literalizing the idea of \"head music.\" For another, even the most understated beats move along briskly, giving the album a whirring sense of momentum. Best, the disk contains some of Yorke's prettiest melodies to date.\n\nRather than simply extending a note endlessly and calling it a tune (as Yorke did with some of Radiohead's \u00c2\u00adlater work), his best solo pieces recall the band's earlier, more formal songwriting, enough to nearly encourage a sing-along.\n\nNot that you'd necessarily want to croon these odes. \"Time is running out for all of us,\" he moans in \"The Clock.\" \"The more I try to erase you/The more that you appear,\" he complains in the title track. In \"Black Swan,\" the chorus informs us over and over that\n\nSo it's not a party record. But \"The Eraser\" keeps a hypnotic hold on you - hissing, swishing and tapping out a sound clean and modern enough to seem like the soundtrack to a Stanley Kubrick film. It's an ode to alienation you can float away on.\n\n'ROPE' GOOD NOOSE FOR KNIGHT FANS\n\n'Don't go looking for trouble,\" \u00c2\u00adadvises Chris Knight at the start of his new album. \"It'll find you anyway.\"\n\nTrue to his word, violence lurks around the corner in many of the singer's latest songs. We meet guys like one who's nursing 57 stitches in his head from a fight with the town psycho. Another character is the son of a dead con who fights against expectations that he'll lead an \u00c2\u00adequally mean life. Then there's a drifting kid who thinks about hanging himself but discovers that he doesn't have the character to pull it off.\n\nKnight sings these songs of threat in a voice well suited to them. His is a hard and gritty sound, full of pent-up anger, lurking hurt and an unflagging spirit.\n\nHe sounds like a scruffier John Mellen\u00c2\u00adcamp or a cousin to Steve Earle. Small wonder \"Enough Rope\" was produced by the latter's frequent collaborator, Ray Kennedy.\n\nOn this terrific fourth work by Knight, he fleshes out his trademark talent for murder ballads with his most nuanced storytelling to date, not to mention some of his hardest-rocking riffs.\n\nKnight's sound can generally be placed in the alterna-country bin. But he turned up the amps this time.\n\nIt's a hot and coiled sound, ripe for biker bars and drinking dumps in any two-bit town. Knight even includes a salute to just such a joint: \"River Road.\"\n\nThe singer extends his rural, working-class \u00c2\u00admilieu with the song \"Old Man,\" about a guy whose relations have all died or moved away from his disfavored part of the country. He's not unlike the guy in another song who complains that urban development has treated the land he grew up on like \"Dirt.\"\n\nSuch tales could easily descend into sentimentality, but Knight never lets them. Even a song as potentially clich\u00c3\u00a9d as an ode to an outlaw (\"Bridle on a Bull\") seems credible when delivered in Knight's tight snarl of a voice.\n\nUnlike so many pseudomacho country stars, Knight's sound isn't just bluster. His fine storytelling, stalwart tunes and credible character mark him as the real thing.",

Thirty-five per cent responded he would do a good/excellent job, 38 per cent thought he would do an acceptable job and 27 per cent thought he would do a poor or very poor job.\n\nThe chair of Abacus Data, Bruce Anderson, said the poll numbers put to rest the notion that if someone doesn't have the job, they couldn't possibly do the job, and reveals a very competitive race.\n\nJust over 40 per cent of Canadians thought Harper would do a poor or very poor job as prime minister, and that could be problematic.\n\n\"It's very high and he's been a polarizing figure, \" Anderson told Evan Solomon on CBC Radio's The House.\n\n\"I think the other thing that we're seeing in these numbers is that the number of people who say Justin Trudeau would do a good or excellent job is substantially higher than either Mr. Harper or Mr. Mulcair,\" Anderson said.\n\nAbacus also tested some of the attack lines each party has been using against the other leaders to explore the weaknesses or potential weaknesses of each leader, including questions on Trudeau's judgment, Harper's honesty and Mulcair's ability to handle the economy.\n\nOn Trudeau respondents were asked: When it comes to what it takes to be prime minister of Canada does Trudeau have sound judgment? Fifty-three per cent of respondents said yes and 47 per cent said no. Respondents were also asked whether Trudeau has good ideas for the country's future. Fifty-nine per cent said yes, and 41 per cent said no.\n\n\"I think the 59% good ideas for the country really stands out for me because his critics have been quick to pounce on his statements on certain policy issues and say he's got wonky ideas, bad ideas for the country, and I think Canadians are telling us here they don't necessarily see things that way,\" Anderson said.\n\nOn Harper, respondents were asked when it comes to what it takes to be prime minister does Harper govern according to values you share. Only 38 per cent said yes, while 62 per cent said no. When asked whether Harper is honest and accountable, 32 per cent said yes and 68 per cent said no.\n\nAnderson said these low numbers are a cumulative effect for the prime minister, with last year being the worst for the Conservatives since Harper came into office.\n\n\"He came into office and won his first election on the back of a movement in the country that said we need more honesty, we need more accountability,\" Anderson said. \"I think last year has been a terrible year for the Conservative brand \u2013 and the prime minister in particular \u2013 on the question of honestly and accountability.\"\n\nAnderson also said the perception that Harper is a highly partisan figure has also hurt him.\n\n\"These numbers basically put the Conservatives on watch that they need to do better if they're going to win another election,\" he said.\n\nOn NDP Leader Tom Mulcair, respondents were asked about his grasp on the economy and his temperament. Forty-nine per cent said Mulcair has a good grasp of how the economy works, 51 per cent said no. And it was evenly split at 50 per cent when respondents were asked whether Mulcair had the right temperament to be prime minister.\n\nThat isn't necessarily a bad thing, Anderson said, \"you only need about 36, 37, 38 per cent to win an election.\"\n\nHe said the two things that are important about these numbers for Mulcair is that a lot of Canadians \"are open-minded about the prospect that he'd be a good prime minister.\"\n\nAs well, his potential weakness is not necessarily temperament, but his economic policies. Anderson also said Canadians in Atlantic Canada and Quebec had a lot more confidence in Mulcair's views of the economy than in the Western provinces.\n\nThe poll was conducted online in both English and French between Jan. 14-18, 2014. Results are based on responses from 1,996 people. There is no margin of error for the survey since the selection of respondents was not random.",

Maybe - and maybe not.\n\nHOTEL NEWS: Government gives hotels more time to make pools accessible\n\nHyatt, which became the first full-service hotel operator to make this type of announcement, certainly thinks today's tech-savvy travelers will appreciate having a cutting-edge TV system that makes Web surfing on a 50-inch screen relatively easy to do.\n\nBut independent travel analyst Henry Harteveldt of Atmosphere Research Group isn't so sure of the announcement's impact.\n\n\"It's great that Hyatt is providing its guests with a very flexible piece of technology,\" told me after Hyatt's announcement last week. \"But it's a nice-to-have, but it's not a need-to-have.\"\n\nMORE ON USA TODAY: Photo tour of movie hotels\n\nHere's a quick recap in case you didn't see last week's story in our Money section and on this blog: Hyatt decided to do away with its old TV system that centered around pay-view movie sale in all of its 135 North American full-service hotels, and go with a new vendor and new cutting-edge system. The new system is based based on the Internet and capable of offering guests more options and services. Most of the major chains are experimenting with systems like this, but until last week no one had made a big announcement to roll one out chain-wide.\n\nHyatt's execs believe the system will modernize the hotel TV and make it more accommodating for travelers who increasingly favor Web content, whether their Netflix or HBO account, Facebook, YouTube or Pandora music. The new system also will let travelers see local information that they might otherwise get from their concierge, and request items from housekeeping, such as additional towels.\n\nTWITTER: Follow Hotel Check-In's BarbDeLollis\n\nYet Harteveldt says that if Hyatt's goal is to become more competitive with the biggest full-service chains, the Chicago-based company needs something: More locations.\n\n\"(The new TV system) is not something that's going to move the needle for Hyatt in terms of (travelers') primary selection criteria,\" Harteveldt says. \"They need more locations in order to compete with Westin, Marriott, Hilton. That's much more important - and, of course, be price competitive.\"\n\nBeyond real estate issues, Harteveldt wonders about Hyatt's decision to install a system that relies on a vendor's keyboard and remote control.\n\nThe system requires guests to use the remote control or lightweight, wireless keyboard, both of which are provided by vendor Roomlinx.\n\nIn general, many people don't like touching hotel TV remote controls due to germ concerns, and the lightweight, wireless hotel keyboard can feel flimsy compared to one's laptop. But there's a bigger issue.\n\nToday's gadget-carrying travelers are most accustomed to using their own devices, so if Hyatt's system let them used their own devices, they could avoid wasting time on figuring out the hotel-room devices.\n\nPlus, travelers who carry an iPad and/or smartphone likely already have apps and websites that already know their account information. To access Web content on their hotel TV screen, they'll have to enter account information via the hotel's remote control or keyboard.\n\n\"Some Marriott and W hotels have televisions where you can plug in your electronics or device,\" Harteveldt notes.\n\nHyatt maintains that guests will want to see their favorite content or work presentations on a 40- or 50-inch hotel TV screen.\n\nThat may be true, but Harteveldt says that's probably more appealing to people staying at a resort, where you typically stay longer and in-room entertainment is more important. Business travelers who are staying one or two nights may not have the time or desire to figure out the new system.\n\nOn last week's story, USA TODAY reader Adam Goldberg wrote that he values high-definition TV programming and remote controls that are not broken.\n\n\"It seems like hotels would be well-off to deal with the simple things before they try to squeeze a few more dollars out of us for internet on televisions,\" Goldberg wrote. \"Is there ANYONE who thinks that checking Facebook on their hotel TV is a necessary feature?\"\n\nReaders: Has a hotel impressed you recently with a cutting-edge TV system?

That rating system will soon expand to testing how well vehicles avoid accidents in the first place.\n\nIn other words, under these new guidelines, it's going to become much more difficult for a vehicle to earn a 5-star safety rating, meaning it's about to get easier for consumers to identify safe cars.\n\nOn the Thursday, the government announced it is launching the overhauled rating system and said it will begin using the new guidelines to begin testing 55 2011 model-year vehicles, including 24 passenger cars, 20 sport utility vehicles, two vans, and nine pickups.\n\nOnce the government finishes testing the 55 chosen vehicles under its new rating system, the results will be posted at Safercar.gov.\n\nAccording to the NHTSA, the new testing program will include tougher crash tests than previous years and will provide consumers with an overall safety score for vehicles.\n\n\"The new testing program will also provide consumers with information about new advanced crash avoidance technologies, such as lane departure and forward collision warning systems,\" a July 29 NHTSA press release said.\n\nA July 30 cars blog post on ConsumerReports.org said the new tests, which are expected to begin rolling out in late September, will include a new pole test and a smaller, female-sized crash-test dummy.\n\n\"The key change in the assignment of star ratings is that cars will be rated against each other rather than against a standard performance level,\" the Consumer Reports blog post said. \"Under the current system so many cars get top scores that they all look alike.

In other words, under these new guidelines, it's going to become much more difficult for a vehicle to earn a 5-star safety rating, meaning it's about to get easier for consumers to identify safe cars. On the Thursday, the government announced..."

In the \u201990s, they epitomized effortless chic, with poster child Jennifer Aniston teaming hers with a tan tank or black cashmere poncho. Of course, the look\u2019s fashion cred was established well before that: See chanteuse Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, tr\u00e8s chic in white jeans in the mid-60s (left), Faye Dunaway, topping snowy denim with a camel turtleneck in 1968\u2019s \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d and Jacqueline Onassis, dodging paparazzi, in a pristine pair and Henley in 1971.\n\nWhite jeans attained icon status in 1992 on the 100th-anniversary cover of Vogue, which featured supermodels clad in white jeans and white shirts, underlining the notion that you needn\u2019t be poured into skintight Ala\u00efa to be drop-dead gorgeous.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, white jeans themselves became skintight, off-puttingly associated with air-kissing women with spray-on tans who summered in the Hamptons and threw hissy fits on \u201cHousewives\u201d reunions. On \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\u201d the host vamped the look in a skit, dorkily dancing to a braggy tune about how good his \u201cTight Pants\u201d looked.\n\nJust like that, a summer classic went from carefree (vulnerability to ros\u00e9 stains aside) to forced and in-your-face.\n\nHappily a stylistic shift has brought white jeans back, albeit in slightly different form. Gone is the blinding optic white, with designers favoring \u201cdirty white\u201d or creamy ivory instead. \u201cIt\u2019s just not pristine, so getting a mark on them isn\u2019t the end of the world,\u201d said Catherine Ryu, women\u2019s creative director at Citizens of Humanity. Rachel Comey, designer of an eponymous line, agrees: \u201cThese jeans are suited for your busy wear-them-everywhere life.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also looser, encouraging actual relaxation that\u2019s more in sync with hammock season. \u201cSilhouettes have definitely eased out,\u201d said Ms. Ryu, who has introduced a classic high-rise fit, reminiscent of the 1990s Levi\u2019s 501s. \u201cWe pushed stretch as far as we could; now there\u2019s a retro feeling\u201d that translates into a less imprisoning silhouette.\n\nOther brands have also launched kinder takes. Ms. Comey offers a straight-legged mid-rise with cropped legs and a raw hem. Levi\u2019s went retro with its \u201cwedgie\u201d jeans that have a snug but not skintight high-in-the-back fit.\n\nThese pairs definitely share DNA with the white denim of decades ago. The granddaddy of them all, White Levi's, found its way into wardrobes in the early \u201960s\u2014thanks to resourceful teens determined to outfox high school dress codes. \u201cIn the \u201950s and \u201960s, many schools prohibited bluejeans, deeming them too casual for the classroom,\u201d said Levi Strauss & Co. historian Tracey Panek. \u201cStudents found a way around the ban by bleaching their jeans white.\u201d Taking note, the company introduced White Levi's.\n\nHow to put your own spin on the look? Introduce texture with a tweedy pullover and basket-weave loafers. Or throw on a classic shirt and add Boho-chic sandals.\n\nJust skip the spray tan.",

Automobiles and housing, however, have been hit hard, and the damage has been spreading into allied industries and beyond.\n\nThe huge General Electric appliance plant in Louisville, Ky., recently put 900 workers on indefinite layoff, and a company spokesman said that as of last week, 6,672 workers throughout G.E. were on indefinite layoff. Most of the workers were employed in the company's appliance and aircraft engine manufacturing divisions.\n\nBig as the numbers may seem, a G.E. spokesman described them as ''not particularly high.'' General Electric's United States workforce totals 270,000.\n\nAnother engine maker, Pratt & Whitney, is also cutting back. The subsidiary of United Technologies has about 3,000 people in its manufacturing division on indefinite layoff, and the company does not expect to rehire them for at least a year.\n\nCutbacks are cropping up among tje airlines. Since the air controllers' strike in August, about 5,000 industry employees have been let go, with American accounting for 1,650 workers, including 200 pilots.\n\nIn automobiles, the five major domestic manufacturers had put 168,155 hourly employees on indefinite layoff by mid-October, and 25,425 on temporary leave. General Motors had the most with 83,000 on indefinte layoff and another 16,800 temporarily off - meaning they have been given assurance they'll be recalled, usually within several weeks.\n\nFord and Chrysler each have about 40,000 on long-term leave as of last week. Chrysler will also furlough 3,500 hourly workers for three weeks while it closes its assembly plant in Belvidere, Ill., for refitting.\n\nAmong the heavy machinery companies, International Harvester, burdened by sagging markets, onerous debt and the residual effects of a long strike, has laid off 9,600 employees, and several thousand more will be laid off this week at plants in Illinois and Indiana.\n\nDeere & Company has laid off about 2,300 workers, mostly in its construction equipment operations at plants in Dubuque and Waterloo, Iowa, bringing total layoffs at Deere to 3,200.\n\nCatepillar Tractor will layoff 12,000 workers at eight of its plants for a week starting Nov. 8. ''The one week layoff was an alternative to indefinite layoffs,'' a company spokesman said.\n\nIn steel, Bethlehem has laid off 2,800 workers at its Johnstown, Pa., plant. The No. 2 steel producer also has more than 2,000 workers on leave at other plants.\n\nAmong the states, Michigan and Oregon have been struggling with severe unemployment for more than a year. But many other states are beginning to feel the bite. Pennsylvania led the country in rising initial unemployment claims for the week ended Oct. 10, according to the Labor Department. The state had a total of 35,412 new claims, up 7,300 from the previous week.\n\nNorth Carolina was next, with 6,600 additional new claims, mostly in the textile industry, for a total of 18,983. Missouri followed with 14,187, up 5,700 claims. Mitchell A. Martin",
